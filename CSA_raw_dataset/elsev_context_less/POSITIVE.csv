"The dashed gray lines in the figures show a power-law fit, using the York_et al._(2004)_CITE maximum likelihood method, to the structure functions for increment distances ranging between approximately 100 and 500 km"
"Additionally, since it is hypothesized that there should be a scale-break for distances greater than approximately 500 km (eg, Nastrom_and_Gage,_1985_CITE), we restrict our fit to increment distances less than or equal to this value"
This is consistent with the first-order structure function of the water vapor field reported by Pressel_(2012)_CITE for a similar model configuration

"To evaluate the subjective quality of the solution, we used the construct perceived accuracy, also developed by Aloysius et al [1]_CITE, which measures the confidence of users in having achieved the best solution."
"For this evaluation, we used the well-established Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by Davis [16]_CITE, which explains attitudes toward an information system via the constructs perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use"
"For both constructs, the original scales developed by Davis [16]_CITE were used."

Some new interesting variants of LPP are introduced in [113]_CITE.
"Since the proof is standard, it is omitted (see, Proposition 3.11 in [3]_CITE)"
"Regression testing ( Yoo_and_Harman,_2012_CITE) is a widely-practiced activity in real-world software development projects ( Onoma_et_al.,_1998_CITE), in which a better testing infrastructure has a potential to recover the economic loss resulting from software failures by one third ( Tassey,_2002_CITE)"
"We have further performed a case study on the comparison of our LBS search algorithm to the algorithms of Greedy ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002_CITE), ART ( Jiang_et_al.,_2009_CITE), and Genetic ( Li_et_al.,_2007_CITE) by encoding test cases using input information and using the even-spread of test cases as the guidance heuristic to determine whether the performance of our techniques is merely attributed to the LBS algorithm"
"In both validations, we measured their effectiveness in terms of the average rate of fault detection (ie, APFD ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002_CITE)) and the time spent in generating a resultant prioritized test suite."
"This work significantly extends its preliminary version ( Jiang_and_Chan,_2013_CITE): (1) It generalizes the family of LBS techniques by presenting five more new techniques and evaluates the family against more existing techniques for benchmarking"
"The main contribution of the paper together with its preliminary version ( Jiang_and_Chan,_2013_CITE) is twofold"
"In our experiment, we follow the algorithm presented in ( Li_et_al.,_2007_CITE) to implement the technique."
"In the evaluation of this work, we follow the implementation consideration presented in ( Li_et_al.,_2007_CITE)"
"Thus, unlike the greedy techniques ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002_CITE) that select the successors among all not yet covered test cases, our LBS techniques are designed to save time by randomly sampling a candidate set of c successors from all possible successors for each state as Jiang et al Jiang_et_al._(2011)_CITE did"
"LBS can be regarded as a novel class of ART ( Jiang_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Following ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002_CITE), we used all the faulty versions whose faults can be revealed by more than 0% and less than 20% of the test cases."
"For the number of runs per test case prioritization technique, according to ( Arcuri_and_Briand,_2011_CITE), 1000 runs per subject are sufficient to evaluate a randomized technique on the subject"
"We extracted the command line and file contents as strings, and use the edit distance ( Gusfield,_1997_CITE) as function f 1."
We selected them because these are representative search-based techniques for test case prioritization and they are evaluated in the experiment reported by Li_et_al._(2007_CITE)
Our implementation of total statement and additional statement follows strictly according to the algorithms described in Elbaum_et_al._(2002_CITE)
"Following ( Jiang_et_al.,_2009_CITE), we further perform both the ANOVA test and the multiple comparisons between each pair of techniques to check whether their means are different significantly on each program"
"The way we generated branch-adequate test suite was the same as the procedure reported in ( Do_et_al.,_2008_CITE), and the use of branch-adequate test suites was popularly used in test case prioritization research studies ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002;_Jiang_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"We measured the efficiency of a test case prioritization technique by its time cost, which is also adopted in Jiang_et_al._(2009_CITE)."
This finding is consistent to the claim by Zhang_et_al._(2013_CITE) that Additional Greedy is still the most effective coverage-based strategy in terms of APFD.
"We have adopted three search-based algorithms, ie, Genetic ( Li_et_al.,_2007_CITE), ART ( Jiang_et_al.,_2009_CITE), and Greedy algorithms for evaluation"
"For the ART algorithm, we use the same algorithm as described in ( Jiang_et_al.,_2009_CITE), except we use input distance rather than code coverage-based test case distance"
"Since the Genetic, ART, and LBS algorithms all involved randomness, we also set the number of repeated trials for each technique as 50 as what we did in ( Jiang_et_al.,_2009_CITE)."
"Furthermore, we also used the edit distance ( Gusfield,_1997_CITE) for measuring test case distance"
"We recall that in evolutionary computing, there is a famous conjecture, informally known as the No Free Lunch theorem ( Wolpert_and_Macready,_1997_CITE)"

"We used Friedman test ( Friedman,_1940_CITE) to compare the AUCs of the different classifiers"

"Since the work of Haralick [8]_CITE, considerable effort has been dedicated to find strategies that quantify how image pixels are distributed within local regions or neighbourhoods"

"Three data sets commonly used in the literature were employed for this purpose, namely, UIUC [9]_CITE, Outex [13]_CITE, and KTH-TIPS2b [2]_CITE"

"To validate the KAMAS prototype and provide evidence for its effectiveness, we followed a threefold research approach consisting of moderated expert reviews, user studies and focus group meetings ( Lazar_et al.,_2010_CITE)"
"The results show a SUS value of 75.83 points out of 100, which can be interpreted as good without significant usability issues according to the SUS description by Bangor_et al._(2009)_CITE"
"Combined results: Based on the combined insights from the five analysis tasks, the SUS and the interviews, we compiled and rated a list of found issues inspired by Nielsen's severity ratings ( Nielsen,_1993_CITE)"
"Following the design study methodology ( Sedlmair_et al.,_2012_CITE), reflection is the third contribution to a design study (retrospective analysis and lessons learned) for the improvement of current guidelines"
"In contrast to other malware analysis systems which build their visual metaphors directly on the output of the data providers, KAMAS uses an input grammar generated by a combination of Malheur ( Rieck,_2016_CITE) and Sequitur ( Nevill-Manning_and_Witten,_1997_CITE) for cluster and data classification"
"Therefore, we use analytical and visual representation methods to provide a scalable and problem-tailored visualization solution following the visual analytics agenda ( Keim_et al.,_2010;_Thomas_and_Cook,_2005_CITE)"

"Finally, we employ an elaboration likelihood model (ELM; Petty_&_Cacioppo,_1986_CITE) to provide a useful framework for making predictions regarding which self-presentation factors influence recruiters evaluations of job seekers ( Forret_&_Turban,_1996_CITE) and therefore influence recruiter hiring recommendations"
"The standard lower bound for Cronbach alpha is 0.6 ( Hair,_Anderson,_Tatham,_&_Black,_2010_CITE)"
The criterion for factor loading suggested by Hair_et_al._(2010)_CITE is greater than 0.5
"We measured argument quality for each self-presentation category using three items adopted from Bhattacherjee_and_Sanford_(2006)_CITE: The information presented by the job seeker on LinkedIn was informative , The information presented by the job seeker on LinkedIn was valuable , and The information presented by the job seeker on LinkedIn was persuasive"
"We measured source credibility for each self-presentation category using three items adopted from Bhattacherjee_and_Sanford_(2006)_CITE: The job seeker presenting the information on LinkedIn was trustworthy , The job seeker presenting the information on LinkedIn was credible , and The job seeker presenting the information on LinkedIn appeared to be experienced and professional"
"We measured perceived P J fit using Kristof-Brown s_(2000)_CITE three-item scale: The job seeker fits the demands of the job , Other employees will think this job seeker is qualified to do this job , and I am confident that this applicant is qualified for this job"
"We measured perceived P O fit from Cable_and_DeRue s_(2002)_CITE three-item scale: The things that the job seeker values in life are very similar to the things that the hiring organisation values , The job seeker values match the hiring organisation values and culture , and The hiring organisation values and culture provide a good fit with the things that the job seeker values in life"
"We measured perceived P P fit on the basis of Howard_and_Ferris _(1996)_CITE three-item scale for measuring affect toward applicant : The job seeker has qualities that I like , I would like to do something with the job seeker , and I would like to spend free time with the job seeker"
"We adopted three items from Tsai,_Chen,_and_Chiu_(2005)_CITE to assess recruiters intentions in terms of hiring recommendations: I consider the job seeker to be suitable for hiring into the hiring organisation , The job seeker would have a good future in the hiring organisation , and The job seeker would perform well for the hiring organisation"
"To complement Harmon test, this study conducted an additional analysis as outlined by Klein,_Rai,_and_Straub_(2007)_CITE and Liang,_Saraf,_Hu,_and_Xue_(2007)_CITE"
"Second, we adopted Malhotra,_Kim,_and_Patil s_approach_(2006)_CITE and modelled all items as indicators of a factor representing the common method effect"
"Our results were consistent with Roulin_and_Bangerter_(2013)_CITE, which indicates that recruiters use job seekers self-presentation signals in online communities to infer characteristics that are predictive of P O fit and P J fit for hiring recommendations, while they focus more on job-related information that is available in online profiles, such as experience and education ( Kristof-Brown,_2000_CITE)."
"Efficient model selection methods are available ( B hlmann,_2000_CITE)"
"See Edwards_and_Ankinakatte_(in press,_Section 10)_CITE for a more precise comparison of APFA with Bayesian and Markov networks."
"Section 3 describes the model selection algorithm of Ron_et al._(1998)_CITE which (in a modified form) forms the core of the haplotype clustering algorithm implemented in the Beagle program ( Browning_and_Browning,_2007a,b_CITE) that is widely used for phasing and imputation of DNA chip data"
This section gives a brief introduction to APFA from a statistical perspective: see Edwards_and_Ankinakatte_(in press)_CITE for a more detailed exposition
The state merging operation and corresponding LRTs are studied in detail in Edwards_and_Ankinakatte_(in press)_CITE
"We compare the model selection algorithm described in the previous section with that described by Browning_and_Browning_(2007a)_CITE and implemented in Beagle in two ways: firstly, by comparing their rate of convergence as the sample size increases using simulation, and secondly by assessing the goodness-of-fit of the selected model using ten-fold cross-validation"
Here we use both the settings suggested in Browning_and_Browning_(2007a)_CITE ( m=4 and b=0.2) and the settings implicit in Browning_(2006)_CITE ( m=1 and b=0)
"As a measure of how well the model A fits the data set, D, Thollard_et al._(2000)_CITE and others suggest using a quantity called the per symbol log likelihood (psLL) for this purpose"
"The data were obtained from the experimenters, are analysed in Edwards_(1992)_CITE and are available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), being supplied along with the package gRapfa"
"The data are freely available to the scientific community, and can be downloaded from CRAN as part of the package TraMineR ( Gabadinho_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"In this paper we have given a brief introduction to the use of APFA to model discrete longitudinal data, and adapted an algorithm proposed by Ron_et al._(1998)_CITE and implemented (with modifications) by Browning_and_Browning_(2007a)_CITE, so that this seeks to minimize a penalized likelihood criterion, for example AIC or BIC"
"The improvement over Beagle is substantial when the settings suggested in Browning_and_Browning_(2007a)_CITE ( m=4 and b=0.2) are used, but when the settings implicit in Browning_(2006)_CITE ( m=1 and b=0) are chosen the performance of the two algorithms was very similar"
"It is commonly used to compare non-nested models ( Kent,_1986_CITE)"
We applied content analysis to the 60 negotiation transcripts following the five stage model suggested by Srnka and Koeszegi [73]_CITE
"In this paper, we extend that model from a stimulus-driven model to one which also considers attentional input: specifically, we test the idea that effects of spatial and feature-based attention are based on very similar mechanisms ( Maunsell_&_Treue,_2006_CITE)"
"We then used Akaike information criterion (AIC) ( Akaike,_1974;_deLeeuw,_1992_CITE) to determine the least distance |la lv| at which the stimulus selection model described the distribution of localizations better than the integration model (columns aVa, avA, aVA, ava in subtables of Table 1)."
"Our model fits in well with the view recently expressed by Krauzlis,_Bollimunta,_Arcizet,_and_Wang_(2014)_CITE that attention may be not so much a mechanism causing certain behavioral and neural phenomena, but an effect emerging from the need for effective information processing"
"This view fits in well with previous work by Krauzlis_et al._(2014)_CITE who argued that attention may, on the network level, be seen not as a cause but an effect of the ecological requirements on information processing"
"Notable successes have been achieved for problems such as test data generation, modularisation, automated patching, and regression testing, with industrial uptake ( Cornford_et_al.,_2003;_Wegener_and_B hler,_2004;_Afzal_et_al.,_2010;_Lakhotia_et_al.,_2010b;_Cadar_et_al.,_2011;_Yoo_et_al.,_2011_CITE) and the provision of tools such as AUSTIN ( Lakhotia_et_al.,_2010a_CITE), Bunch ( Mitchell_and_Mancoridis,_2006_CITE), EvoSuite ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2011_CITE), GenProg ( Le_Goues_et_al.,_2012_CITE), Milu ( Jia_and_Harman,_2008_CITE) and SWAT ( Alshahwan_and_Harman,_2011_CITE)."
"There are many surveys, overviews and reviews of SBSE that provide more in-depth treatment and coverage of results specific to individual engineering subdisciplines such as requirements analysis ( Zhang_et_al.,_2008_CITE), predictive modelling ( Harman,_2010;_Afzal_and_Torkar,_2011_CITE), non-functional properties ( Afzal_et_al.,_2009_CITE), program comprehension ( Harman,_2007_CITE), design ( R ih ,_2010_CITE) and testing ( McMinn,_2004;_Harman,_2008;_Afzal_et_al.,_2009;_Ali_et_al.,_2010_CITE)"

"Based on the referenced literature [2 5]_CITE, we modified (B) (B ), which represents the fuzzy-state assumption"
"Using the decomposition theory, we obtained the following result: (9)A = 0 Using a method similar to that of Yao and Wu [13]_CITE, we considered the signed distance and ranking on F IV( , )"
"Using the same arguments as those of Yao and Wu [13]_CITE, we obtained the following properties: Property 1If A ,B FIV( , ),(FIV( , ), , ) satisfies the law of trichotomy"
"By applying the method of Kaufmann and Gupta [10]_CITE and Zimmermann [14]_CITE, we derived the following property: Property 2If A =(a,b,c; ),B =(p,q,r; ) FN( ),1 FP,(10)(a,b,c; ) (p,q,r; )=(a+p,b+q,c+r; )(20)(a,b,c; ) (p,q,r; )=(a-r,b-q,c-p; )(30)1 (a,b,c; )=(1-c,1-b,1-a; )LetA L=(a1,b1,c1; ),B L=(p1,q1,r1; ) FN( ),A U=(a2,b1,c2; ),B U=(p2,q1,r2; ) FN( ),1 FP"
"Using the method proposed by Zimmermann [14]_CITE, we used Fig_4 approximate to Fig_3 to obtain A L B L (a1p1,b1q1,c1r1; ), similarly, A U B U (a2p2,b1q1,c2r2; )"

"So, overlapping domain decomposition [8]_CITE appears as a promising approach to solving such large systems since the mesh is divided into subdomains and the linear systems involved are consequently reduced [9,10]_CITE, implying a significant reduction in wind field calculation execution time"
"Successful implementations of home health care scheduling tools are described, eg, in Eveborn_et al._(2006_CITE, 2009)_CITE or Begur_et al._(1997)_CITE"
"An overview of home care routing and scheduling and related problems can be found in Castillo-Salazar,_Landa-Silva,_and_Qu_(2015)_CITE"
"We then design a metaheuristic solution framework that is based on multi-directional local search ( Tricoire,_2012_CITE) to solve instances of realistic size (see Section 4)"
"The algorithm is based on the multi-directional local search framework ( Tricoire,_2012_CITE) and uses large neighborhood search (LNS) as a subheuristic"
Large neighborhood search (LNS) is a metaheuristic which was first introduced by Shaw_(1998)_CITE
A successful general-purpose LNS algorithm for a variety of vehicle routing problems was proposed by Pisinger_and_Ropke_(2007)_CITE
An adaptive version of LNS is proposed by Ropke_and_Pisinger_(2006)_CITE in which the selection of the operators is biased using their success in previous iterations
"For details and an overview of recent developments on LNS, the reader is referred to Pisinger_and_Ropke_(2010)_CITE"
"Tricoire_(2012)_CITE shows that, using LNS as a subheuristic, the MDLS framework produces results which are competitive to those of the best known solution method for three general multi-objective optimization problems (multi-dimensional multi-objective knapsack problem, bi-objective set packing problem, bi-objective orienteering problem)"
"The structure of our MDLS algorithm is very similar to the structure described by Tricoire_(2012)_CITE, although in our case a single-objective local search procedure may result in more than one new solution as is discussed in Section 4.2"
"As in Shaw_(1998)_CITE and Ropke_and_Pisinger_(2006)_CITE, a parameter P 1 is used in all worst removal operators to introduce some randomness in the selection of jobs, thereby avoiding the same jobs to be removed over and over again"
"For a detailed discussion of these operators, the reader is referred to Ropke_and_Pisinger_(2006)_CITE and Pisinger_and_Ropke_(2007)_CITE"
"However, the parameter values that have been applied are based on both real-life data of two Viennese companies and real-life-based benchmark data for a related problem ( Hiermann_et al.,_2015_CITE)"
"To assess the quality of the proposed metaheuristic, Pareto-optimal solutions for small problem instances are generated by embedding the model described in Section 2.1 into the well-known -constraint scheme ( Laumanns,_Thiele,_&_Zitzler,_2006_CITE)"
"Local features, such as local Gabor binary patterns (LGBP) [3]_CITE and high-dimensional local binary patterns (LBP) [4]_CITE, are effective for face recognition"

"In Section 6, we apply the above algorithm to the FERET [23]_CITE database and present the experimental results"
"The Lucas Kanade algorithm [11]_CITE is effective for learning warps between poses, as shown in Fig_2."
"To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MVV AE, we compared it with the weighted LBP [21]_CITE, LGBP [3]_CITE, SIFT [20]_CITE, Affine-SIFT [22]_CITE, stack flow [11]_CITE, and OSS [16]_CITE"
"For example, in Rouane_et_al._(2004_CITE) there is an interesting discussion on attribute conflicts, but the authors do not address in detail how these problems are resolved"
In this research we use a pre-defined data dictionary developed in Fu_and_Cohn_(2008a)_CITE to disambiguate attributes
"The mapping and integration was carried out in a semi-automated manner, where data acquisition and attribute disambiguation were conducted manually, the open source tool Galicia ( Valtchev_et_al.,_2003_CITE) was employed for context manipulation and GSH generation, and all other processes such as information explication and conceptual scaling were completed with Java and SQL codes"
We employ the ontology measures proposed in Dellschaft_and_Staab_(2006_CITE) and Maedche_and_Staab_(2002_CITE) in our experiments
"To evaluate the quality of this integrated ontology ( FCA ontology for short), we compared it against a handcrafted ontology that was developed with a traditional knowledge engineering approach as described in Fu_and_Cohn_(2008a)_CITE ( KE ontology for short)"
"We evaluate the two ontologies in the similar fashion as done in ( Brewster,_Alani,_Dasmahapatra,_&_Wilks,_2004_CITE)"

"The proposed method is based on the discriminative features extracted from skin probability maps, obtained using a conventional Bayesian classifier ( Jones_and_Rehg,_2002_CITE)"
"Here, we introduce the discriminative skin-presence features (DSPFs), derived from the discriminative textural features (DTFs) described in our earlier works on skin detection ( Kawulok,_2012_CITE) and image colorization ( Kawulok_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"For the spatial analysis we adapted an algorithm based on the distance transform in a combined domain (DTCD) of hue, luminance and skin probability, developed during our earlier study ( Kawulok,_2013_CITE)"
"The proposed method was compared with another approach proposed by Jiang_et_al._(2007)_CITE, who also exploit the textural features, which is followed by the spatial analysis"
A thorough survey comparing various color-based skin detection approaches was presented by Kakumanu_et_al._(2007)_CITE.
A technique operating in multiple color spaces to increase the stability was described by Kukharev_and_Nowosielski_(2004)_CITE
"An interesting algorithm incorporating color, texture and space analysis was given by Jiang_et_al._(2007)_CITE"
"In the presented study, the skin probability maps were obtained using Bayesian skin modeling introduced by Jones_and_Rehg_(2002)_CITE"
"Linear discriminant analysis ( Seber,_1984_CITE) is a supervised statistical feature extraction method frequently used in machine learning, and here it was applied to extract the discriminative textural features"
"In the research reported in this paper we used a spatial analysis method which we developed during our earlier works ( Kawulok,_2013_CITE)"
The minimization is performed using the Dijkstra algorithm as proposed by Ikonen_and_Toivanen_(2007)_CITE
"In addition, P threshold is used as proposed by del_Solar_and_Verschae_(2004)_CITE, which prevents the propagation to the regions of very low skin probability."
"The latter allows for better separation between the skin and non-skin pixels, resulting in lower detection errors, which was demonstrated in ( Kawulok,_2012_CITE)"
"We considered including other features like entropy or local binary patterns ( Ojala_et_al.,_2002_CITE) into the BIFs, as they are often used for texture segmentation, however it did not improve the results, whereas the computational costs were increased"
"First, for a given training set of images and associated skin masks, the probability look-up table is obtained using the Bayesian skin modeling ( Jones_and_Rehg,_2002_CITE)"
"The experiments were carried out for two data sets, namely: 4000 images from the ECU database ( Phung_et_al.,_2003_CITE), and 899 hand images (termed HGR) which we registered for the gesture recognition purposes (available at HYPERLINK mkawulok/gestures)"
"Furthermore, we compared the method with the Bayesian classifier ( Jones_and_Rehg,_2002_CITE), diffusion-based spatial analysis (DSA) introduced by del_Solar_and_Verschae_(2004)_CITE and our DTCD method performed in the skin probability maps obtained using the Bayesian classifier ( Kawulok,_2013_CITE)"
"In the case of the DTCD performed in the raw skin probability map, the threshold P was set to 0.6 for the ECU data set and to 0.4 for the HGR set as suggested in Kawulok_(2013)_CITE."
"The table also includes the comparison with the DTF method ( Kawulok,_2012_CITE)"
"Sensitivity analysis: We have implemented the approach as an extension to the EvoSuite tool ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2013b_CITE), and analyze the effects of the different parameters involved in the local search, and determine the best configuration."
"This paper is an extension of Fraser_et al._(2013)_CITE, and it is organized as follows: Section 2 presents relevant background to search-based testing, and the different types of search that may be applied, including local search and search using Genetic and Memetic Algorithms"
"A popular version of local search often used in test data generation is Korel's Alternating Variable Method ( Korel,_1990;_Ferguson_and_Korel,_1996_CITE)"
"The use of MAs for test generation was originally proposed by Wang_and_Jeng_(2006)_CITE in the context of test generation for procedural code, and has since then been applied in different domains, such as combinatorial testing ( Rodriguez-Tello_and_Torres-Jimenez,_2010_CITE)"
Search operators for string values have initially been proposed by Alshraideh_and_Bottaci_(2006)_CITE
"Floating point datatypes: for floating point variables ( float, double) we use the same approach as originally defined by Harman_and_McMinn_(2007)_CITE for handling floating point numbers with the AVM"
"For this we use the approach that EvoSuite successfully applied to combine search-based testing and dynamic symbolic execution ( Galeotti_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"Therefore, we chose classes already used in previous experiments ( Arcuri_and_Fraser,_2013_CITE), but excluded those on which EvoSuite trivially already achieves 100% coverage, as there was no scope for improvement with local search"
"To this end, beside classes taken from the case study in Arcuri_and_Fraser_(2013)_CITE, we also included four benchmark classes on integer and floating point calculations from the Roops 2 2HYPERLINK"
"First, we used the SF100 corpus of classes ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2012_CITE)"
"Therefore, we used the case study of the Carfast ( Park_et al.,_2012_CITE) test generation tool 3 3Available at: HYPERLINK, accessed June 2013"
"We also considered seeding from bytecode ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2012_CITE) as a further parameter to experiment with"
"To evaluate the statistical and practical differences among the different settings, we followed the guidelines by Arcuri_and_Briand_(2014)_CITE"
"In this paper, when we do this kind of analysis, we create rank tables, in a similar way as we did in previous work ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2013_CITE)"
"In this paper we have not to applied such corrections, for reasons discussed by Arcuri_and_Briand_(2014),_Perneger_(1998)_CITE and Nakagawa_(2004)_CITE, with which we are in agreement with."
"As described in Section 4.3, we use the adaptive methods introduced by Galeotti_et al._(2013)_CITE"
"However, the technique we applied in our experiments was simple, and there is potential for further improvements using more advanced parameter control techniques ( Eiben_et al.,_1999_CITE)"
Krombholz_et al._(2013)_CITE provides a survey of such techniques which we take as instructive in this regard
"From the roster pages we can extract the names of employees (using the Stanford NER tool ( Finkel_et al.,_2005_CITE))"
"A C5.0 decision tree from the C50 R implementation ( Kuhn_et al.,_2015_CITE) was evaluated on a 90:10 training/test split of the dataset using a cost matrix which penalised false positives."
"Using a method adopted from Gonzalez_et al._(2013)_CITE, we randomly sampled 1161 Google+ profiles from the network."
"This sampling process is designed to avoid biases in the dataset being used for evaluating this component of the system, and is more fully described by Edwards_et al._(2016)_CITE."
We base our time comparison of profiles on the work of Atig_et al._(2014)_CITE
"Writing style similarity can be highly useful in identifying individuals, and the authorship analysis literature contains many well-performing supervised solutions (eg Afroz_et al._(2014)_CITE)."
Another simple and straightforward approach by Daubney et al [41]_CITE was the sparse set of features for pose estimation in low-level motions
"A high-level introduction to the motivations for doing so are provided by Hardy_(1997_CITE), while Bishop_(2007_CITE) provides discussion around the thought processes involved in scoping a meaningful penetration test, and addresses topics such as goal setting, attacker knowledge, resources, and ethics"
"Yeo_(2013_CITE) provides a more detailed methodology for the reconnaissance and attack phases of a penetration test, which is largely linear, with a cyclical element where compromise leads to the requirement for further enumeration"
"Penetration testing is frequently cited within the vulnerability assessment requirements of ISO/IEC 15408-3:2008 ( British_Standards_Institution,_2009_CITE)."
"Once a set of features is chosen, we train and classify the data using three common supervised machine-learning classifiers Naive Bayes, a Bayesian network ( John_and_Langley,_1995_CITE), and a support vector machine (SVM) ( Cortes_and_Vapnik,_1995_CITE)."
"Due to the sparsity of triggering relations existing in network traffic, we leverage the customized cost matrices ( Elkan,_2001_CITE) to penalize missed relations during the training"
"Additionally, we adopt our approach on a DARPA dataset ( MIT_Lincoln_Laboratory_CITE)"
"In dataset III, the malicious requests are labeled based on the IDMEF alerts and audit logs ( MIT_Lincoln_Laboratory_CITE)"
"The conventional precision and recall measures ( Baeza-Yates_et al.,_1999_CITE) evaluate the classification accuracy of the positives (ie, the existence of triggering relations)"
The compositional rule of inference [1]_CITE offers an effective mechanism for performing fuzzy inference with dense rule bases
"Fortunately, using fuzzy rule interpolation (FRI) [3,4]_CITE, certain useful conclusions may still be obtained."
"As with a number of conventional FRI approaches, the approach in this work is developed following the principle of analogical reasoning [27]_CITE"
"Using the method in [33]_CITE, the similarity between these two fuzzy sets is 0.002"
"Further to the examples previously shown, the proposed approach has also been evaluated against further applications for decision support, by adapting UCI-MLR benchmark datasets [34]_CITE, including Yacht Hydrodynamics, Servo, Concrete Compressive Strength, and Housing."
"However, even though this idea has been successfully used in mathematics [14]_CITE, the challenge in the case of Physics is to make cut-elimination algorithms work with high-level calculi such as LK P."
"The idea of formalizing a problem as a theorem and in such a way that its solution is in the instances used for the quantified variables in the proof is the fundamental principle behind the logic programming paradigm of computation, of which Prolog [19]_CITE is the most prominent language"
"Therefore, they essentially adhere to the traditional Hilbert-style axiomatization approach, and hence they suffer the same drawbacks, which are nicely explained from a computational point of view in [7]_CITE"
"The computation time that was previously ignored now appears explicitly as the length of proofs [17]_CITE and theories can naturally evolve by the addition and transformation of proofs in the collection, with new concepts emerging by the introduction of cuts and definition inferences."
Another indication that AIT and proof theory fit well together is the natural relation between cut-introduction and Kolmogorov complexity [13]_CITE
"For this purpose, widely accepted by the distributed systems community, is the use of the Autonomic Computing (AC) paradigm [2]_CITE to endow distributed systems with self-management capacities, such as self-adaptation and self-optimizing."
"Variability is modelled at different abstraction levels, mostly using feature models (FM) [3]_CITE at the requirements level and UML profiles or Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) [4 6]_CITE at the architectural level"
"For the rest of steps, we follow the widely known MAPE-K loop [8]_CITE of the AC paradigm, where MAPE stands for Monitoring, Analysis, Plan and Execution and K stands for Knowledge"
"For this we use a GA called DAGAME [22]_CITE, optimized to be executed at runtime with scarce resources"
"Concretely, as shown in [23]_CITE, exact techniques can only be applied to small cases at the cost of a very high execution time"
"In this paper, we use the DAGAME algorithm that focuses on optimizing feature models configurations, to optimize the VSpecs tree, as it has proven to be efficient and produces nearly-optimal results [22]_CITE"
"According to the definition provided in [31]_CITE, an architectural element is quiescent if the following criteria are satisfied: 1"
"If we apply the concept of optimality [23]_CITE, which is defined by Guo et al as the ratio between the utility of the solution obtained using DAGAME and the utility of the optimal solution, obtained using the exact method, we can see that, in the worst case, the optimality of the solutions obtained using DAGAME is higher than 87.4%"
"However, as shown in [22]_CITE, it is very straightforward to modify DAGAME in order to include the ability to take into account the usage of distinct resources"
"Brataas et al have proved that, in the dynamic reconfiguration process, the most relevant task regarding execution time is the decision of the new configuration [30]_CITE"
"To this end, they extend the Rainbow framework [37]_CITE with a mechanism for predicting resource availability based on data gathered in the past"
"This is also the objective of [23]_CITE, but using genetic algorithms, being even faster than the previous one"
"There are ample excellent reviews and text books on this topic; for example, the two books one by Hand [4]_CITE and the other by Murphy [8]_CITE give adequate and accessible descriptions of the bulk of these approaches devised in recent (and not so recent) years."
"[10]_CITE (Chapters 6) for detailed technical and practical discussions expressing the kernel function as a finite series expansion (5)K(x,xi; )= m=1M m(x) m(xi),which renders the right hand side of Eq 4 (6)1 i=1N ji i=1NK(x,xi; ) ji=1 i=1N ji i=1N ji m=1M m(x) m(xi),with { m}m=1M being appropriate basis functions (not necessarily polynomials) defined in the feature space in which the pattern vectors x and x i reside."
"This dissimilarity measure d( x, x i) can be conveniently expressed as [4]_CITE (10)d(x,xi)=xTx 2xTxi+xiTxiIn passing, the AA kernel is basically a discrete analogue of an isotropic Gaussian kernel [17,18]_CITE."
"Note that in [15]_CITE the authors developed a more general version of max min algebra over arbitrary linearly ordered set, but we will not follow this generalization here."
"The development of max min convexity has been mostly inspired by new geometric techniques in max plus (tropical) linear algebra, like those developed in [1,6,7,16]_CITE"
"Zimmermann [28]_CITE, and it gained new impetus after the works of Cohen, Gaubert, Quadrat and Singer [5]_CITE, and Develin and Sturmfels [6]_CITE"
"See [20]_CITE for a survey of max min convexity that also includes some new results, in particular, colorful extensions of the max min Carath odory theorem, as well as some applications of the topological Radon theorem."
"Although our interest here is mostly theoretical, it is also motivated by the theory of fuzzy sets [27]_CITE, which has numerous applications in computer science and decision theory"
"Our approach is inspired by a geometric idea behind the notion the tropical rank [7]_CITE, that is, a tropically convex polytope can be represented as a union of conventionally convex sets, and its dimension can be defined as the greatest dimension of these convex sets"
"Therefore, similarly to the max plus case (see [21]_CITE, Remark 4.3) in Bd there are elementary segments in only 2d 1 directions"
"We now show that for A B(k,k) our notion of strong regularity is equivalent to the trapezoidal property, and hence it coincides with the strong regularity in max min algebra introduced in [2]_CITE"
"It follows, for instance, from Butkovi and Szabo [3,_Theorem_2]_CITE"
"We now conclude with the following observation, which is similar to [2,_Theorem_3]_CITE"
"(ii) (iii): For this we can exploit, eg, [2,_Theorem_3]_CITE"
"To find such a submatrix, that is, to verify that the equivalent conditions of Theorem 5.8 hold, we can apply the strongly polynomial algorithm of [2]_CITE"
In this paper we introduce the notion of dimension of a max min convex set and show that it is equivalent to a notion of matrix rank based on the strong regularity for the matrices in max min algebra [2]_CITE
"Since the max min convex combinations also appear as mixtures of possibilistic measures in the framework of Dubois and Prade's possibility theory [8]_CITE, this paper can be seen as a contribution towards the geometry of such mixtures"
"We present our experimental set-up and results on a dataset of 10 full-body actions that has been previously used to report recognition performance with manual segmentation for ground-truth labeling ( Parisi,_Weber,_&_Wermter,_2014,_2015_CITE)"
"To evaluate our system, we compared newly obtained results with recently reported results using hierarchical GWR-based recognition ( Parisi_et_al.,_2015_CITE)"
"Our action dataset is composed of 10 full-body actions performed by 13 subjects ( Parisi_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Similar to Parisi_et_al._(2015)_CITE, each network was trained for 500 epochs over the entire training set"
"Experimental results showed an average classification accuracy of 93.3%, comparing with the state-of-the-art results of 94% reported by Parisi_et_al._(2015)_CITE that required the manual segmentation of training samples for assigning ground-truth labels"
"This model was able to solve a simple mental rotation task of 2D visually-perceived objects in a simulated humanoid robot, the iCub ( Tikhanoff_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"In this study we propose a new neuro-robotic model of mental rotation that builds upon the prior model proposed in Seepanomwan_et al._(2013a,_2013b)_CITE and overcomes its limitations discussed above"
"Moreover, it employs a flexible decision making mechanism, based on biologically plausible models of decision making ( Bogacz,_Brown,_Moehlis,_Holmes,_&_Cohen,_2006;_Usher_&_McClelland,_2001_CITE), that reproduces an error rate that varies gradually with the difficulty of the mental rotation"
"The model is tested through the hardware iCub humanoid robot ( Metta,_Sandini,_Vernon,_Natale,_&_Nori,_2008;_Sandini,_Metta,_&_Vernon,_2007_CITE) alongside the iCub simulator ( Tikhanoff_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"A meta-review ( Zacks,_2008_CITE) summarises the main areas that several studies have found to play a relevant role ( Fig_1 )."
"This model (together with other analogous models, eg Bogacz_et al.,_2006_CITE) is very important, as it allows the reproduction of the reaction times often recorded in psychological experiments ( Caligiore_et al.,_2010,_2008;_Erlhagen_&_Sch ner,_2002_CITE)"
"It is one of the most accredited models of decision making processes taking place in the human brain ( Bogacz,_2007_CITE)."
"The robot was tested in a mental rotation task similar to those typically used in mental rotation experiments with humans (eg, Shepard_&_Metzler,_1971;_Wexler_et al.,_1998_CITE)"
"The training was based on an abstraction of motor babbling ( Caligiore_et al.,_2008_CITE), a process where random movements are exploited to acquire motor competencies"
"This rule exploits some of the mechanisms of the (unsupervised) Kohonen learning rule ( Kohonen,_2001_CITE) but is used in a supervised-learning fashion to ensure the acquisition of the link between images and their corresponding wrist orientations"
"First, starting from the approach followed in Caligiore_et al._(2010)_CITE, the model macro-architecture was constrained with knowledge on the areas of the human brain involved in mental rotation obtained with brain imaging studies and other neuroscientific studies suggesting the mechanisms operating within them"
"The work by Fahimnia_et_al._(2015)_CITE presents a review of quantitative and analytical models (ie mathematical, optimisation and simulation modelling efforts) for managing supply chain risks and points to generative research areas that have provided the field with foundational knowledge, concepts, theories, tools, and techniques"
"Examples of work of special relevancy here include Blackhurst_and_Wu_(2009),_Brandenburg,_Govindan,_Sarkis,_and_Seuring_(2014),_Heckmann,_Comes,_and_Nickel_(2015),_J ttner,_Peck,_and_Christopher_(2003),_Peck_(2006),_Tang_and_Zhou_(2012),_Zsidisin_(2003)_CITE and Zsidisin_and_Ritchie_(2010)_CITE"

"A pioneering work was carried out by Klinke_and_Renn_(2002)_CITE, who offered a new classification of risk types and management strategies"
"The development and operation of policies are often structured by the following stages inspired by decision theory (eg Althaus,_Bridgman,_&_Davis,_2007_CITE): 1.Problem identification the recognition of an issue that demands further attention2.Generating alternatives, analysis3.Processing covering aspects like policy instrumentation development, consulting, deliberation and coordination4.Decision-making5.Implementation6.Evaluation (assessing the effectiveness of the policy)"

"There is a vast amount of literature (see eg Hopkins,_2014;_Le_Coze,_2013;_Weick,_Sutcliffe,_&_Obstfeld,_1999_CITE) providing arguments for organisations to organise their efforts in line with these principles in order to obtain high performance (high reliability) and effectively manage risks, the unforeseen and potential surprises."
Cox_(2012)_CITE reviews and discusses such approaches and methods to meet deep uncertainties
"See also Hamilton,_Lambert,_and_Valverde_(2015)_CITE."
Taleb_(2007)_CITE made the black swan metaphor well-known and it is widely used today
"His work has inspired many authors, also on foundational issues (eg, Aven,_2015a;_Chichilnisky,_2013;_Feduzi_&_Runde,_2014;_Masys,_2012_CITE), and recently there has been a lively discussion about the meaning of the black swan metaphor and its use in risk management; see Haugen_and_Vinnem_(2015)_CITE and Aven_(2015d,_2015e_CITE)"
Flage_and_Aven_(2015_CITE) perform an in-depth analysis of the emerging risk concept and in particular its relation to black swan type of events through the known/unknown
"To overcome these drawbacks, Herda et al [17]_CITE introduced a real-time method using an anatomical human model to predict the position of the markers"
"Inspired by [23]_CITE, our model also takes the low-rank structure property into account"
"In [23]_CITE, Lai et al simply modified the objective function of SVT [7]_CITE by imposing an inequality equation so that it is able to handle the mocap data de-noising problem"
"And inspired by the success of the penalized least squares regression model [14]_CITE, we seek to minimize the following objective function (11)L(x )= G1/2(x -x) 2+ R(x ),where R(x ) is a regularization term, is a scalar which determines the balance between the first fitting term and the second smoothing term, and G is a diagonal matrix such that Gi,i represents a weight assigned to the observed ith entry of x"
"In [33]_CITE, the authors have compared all of these algorithms and demonstrated that the ALM algorithm is much faster than the other methods and its precision is also higher [33]_CITE"
"For more details about the ALM algorithm, please refer to [33]_CITE"
"Because data from CMU dataset are very clean and complete [37]_CITE, we used them in the synthetic experiments"
"To evaluate the performance of our method, we compare it with the other four methods: Linear interpolation (Linear), Spline interpolation (Spline), Dynammo [30]_CITE and SVT [23]_CITE"
"SVT [23]_CITE and our method are much more suitable to handle long sequences (eg, boxing and tai chi sequences in Fig_7(k) and (i)) than short sequences (eg, run and walk sequences in Fig_7(a) and (b))."
Dynammo [30]_CITE works very well in handling periodic actions such as walking and running
"Relatively speaking, we find that Dynammo [30]_CITE offers the best performance for all the three motion sequences"
"Meanwhile, one can notice that our method takes up more time than SVT [23]_CITE in two human activities: boxing and basketball"
Section 3 introduces the theory based on the steps recommended by Sj berg_et_al._(2008)_CITE
"Stewart_(2001)_CITE describes the essential elements or assets that contribute to the development of intellectual capital as: Structural capital: Codified knowledge that can be transferred (eg, patents, processes, databases, and networks)"
Here it has been chosen to use the division of intellectual capital advocated by Youndt_et_al._(2004)_CITE for two main reasons
"Because, the capacity for effective software development in a unit is typically a function of both its internal linkage and its external linkage to other units and experts, we have adopted the view of Nahapiet_and_Ghoshal_(1998)_CITE, who describe the social capital as both internal and external to a unit."
"Some of the laws described by Endres_and_Rombach_(2003)_CITE are well established in both research and practice and others are not, and some of them can be turned into theories"
"Hoegl_and_Gemuenden's_(2001)_CITE frequently cited study, for example, shows the effect of TWQ on team performance and team members success for a set of traditional software development teams."
"Due to the lack of studies on the effect of TWQ in agile teams, we conducted a survey on this topic by replicating the study of Hoegl_and_Gemuenden_(2001)_CITE"
"This survey was a differentiated replication ( Lindsay_and_Ehrenberg,_1993_CITE)"
"The agile manifesto was not formulated before 2001, and the first book on Scrum was published in 2001 ( Schwaber_and_Beedle,_2001_CITE)"

"We represent the production costs for these fields with a quadratic cost function based on a modification of the function provided by Golombek,_Gjelsvik,_and_Rosendahl_(1995)_CITE"
"For the production cost in the swing fields, we have based our parameters on Golombek,_Gjelsvik,_and_Rosendahl_(1998)_CITE and Kon-Kraft_(2003)_CITE."
"The market prices are represented by 10 outcomes that are generated with the moment-matching procedure described in H yland,_Kaut,_and_Wallace_(2003)_CITE"
"Testing our model framework on multiple sets of generated market price outcomes showed that 10 was a sufficient number of outcomes to achieve in-sample stability (Kaut,_Wallace,_Vladimirou,_and_Zenios,_2007)_CITE, with a standard deviation of 0.01 percent on the SP3 objective function value"
"Drawing below on social identity theory ( Tajfel_&_Turner,_1979_CITE), we demonstrate that identification with other forum users plays an influential role in both these processes."
"In one illustrative intervention study ( Hampton_&_Wellman,_2003_CITE), a suburb of Toronto had been turned into a wired suburb when residents were offered a package of online services, including high-speed internet access, videophone, online health advice, and local online discussion forums"
"This approach inspires us to draw a distinction between instrumental reasons for joining forums (eg, to seek information) and social reasons the two main reasons that have emerged in our preliminary research into this question ( Pendry,_Mewse,_&_Burgoyne,_2012_CITE)."
"Forum identification was assessed using Aron,_Aron,_and_Smollan s_(1992)_CITE Inclusion of Other in the Self (IOS) measure, adapted to measure ingroup identification (in line with the usage of Tropp_&_Wright,_2001_CITE)"
"This was measured using the five-item Satisfaction With Life scale (SWLS; Diener,_Emmons,_Larsen,_&_Griffin,_1985_CITE), designed to measure global cognitive judgments of one concept of life satisfaction"
"We used the procedure and SPSS macro written by Hayes_(2013)_CITE to compute not only the magnitude of the indirect effect but also percentile bootstrap confidence intervals (as recommended by Fritz,_Taylor,_&_MacKinnon,_2012_CITE) to assess whether identification serves as a mediator"
"Thus, according to both the Sobel test approach and the currently standard approach ( Preacher_&_Hayes,_2008_CITE), identification does indeed mediate the relationship between having one social expectations met/exceeded and the two outcomes of interest in this paper, supporting Hypothesis 5."
"Our approach is implemented utilizing the MOCell MOGA [21]_CITE, in which the population of individuals is arranged as a two-dimensional grid and an external archive is used to store the set of non-dominated solutions found so far"
Soft constraints have been implemented into the approach utilizing Constrained Pareto Dominance [10]_CITE as defined as the constraint handling procedure within the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGAII) [10]_CITE
Selection is performed via binary tournament (see [13]_CITE for more details) with single point crossover (with crossover probability 0.9) and bit flip mutation (with probability 0.01) employed (see [15]_CITE for discussions of crossover and mutation).

"Furthermore, to evaluate the significance of the improvement, we use two-sided hypothesis testing ( Wohlin_et al.,_2012_CITE) to compare the AUC with the following null and alternative hypotheses: H0:AUCHora=AUCMonolithicH1:AUCHora AUCMonolithicThe p-value is reported as the result of the test"
The method used in testing is introduced by DeLong_et al._(1988)_CITE to compare two or more AUCs
"The ROC curves, AUCs, and the results of the tests presented in Section 4.2 are generated using the pROC package ( Robin_et al.,_2011_CITE) available in R ( R_Core_Team,_2015_CITE)."
"In our evaluation, we consider three types of faults from real world incidents ( Pertet_and_Narasimhan,_2005_CITE), which are memory leak, system overload, and node crash"
"Therefore, we select an open-source application that is representative for the state-of-the-art enterprise systems, in terms of architectural style (microservice-based ( Newman,_2015_CITE)) and technology (NetflixOSS ecosystem)"
"Since covering all possible fault types is practically infeasible, we select three representative fault types from real world incidents based on Pertet_and_Narasimhan_(2005)_CITE"
Cheung_CITE proposes a seminal software reliability model that takes into account reliability of individual components along with the probability of calling other components
Albanese_et al._(2013)_CITE present a well-modeled formalism for complex inter-dependencies of missions as a set of tasks
Jakobson_(2011)_CITE presents a well-understood conceptual framework using interdependencies based on operational capacity at different abstraction layers
"This modeling approach is well accepted and can be found, eg, in Albanese_et al._(2013),_de_Barros_Barreto_et al._(2013),_Musman_et al._(2011)_CITE"
"Therefore, we extend a model by Jakobson_(2011)_CITE and model mission dependencies as shown in Fig_2 as a graph of mission nodes"
"To acquire the local CPD P(X|Y ) of node X from all its individual dependencies on nodes Y Y , we employ noisy-and and noisy-or combination functions, as, eg, described by Henrion in ( Henrion,_1988_CITE )."
"With Definition 3, a mission dependency model represents a probabilistic graphical model, and, in particular, a Bayesian network, as, eg, defined by Pearl_and_Russell_(2003)_CITE"
"Future work is dedicated to adapt existing approximation techniques, eg, Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering as presented in Doucet_et al._(2000)_CITE for DBNs toward novel ADBNs"
"Moreover, we discuss an extension of the presented approach toward dynamic mission impact assessments, providing a predictive and retrospect analysis of impacts over time, based on a novel dynamic probabilistic graphical model presented by Motzek_and_M ller_(2015a)_CITE"
"Recent work by Motzek_and_M ller_(2016)_CITE motivates that an automated response system can be reduced to a mathematical minimization of the expected mission impact in the presented models in a predictive and retrospect analysis over time in changing, dynamic environments."
String matching [1]_CITE is a widely known problem in Computer Science
The problem of order-preserving matching [2 6]_CITE has gained attention lately
"Our approach with sublinear filters was considerably faster than the algorithm by Cho et al [5]_CITE, which is the first sublinear solution of the problem."
All the algorithms were implemented in C in the 64-bit mode and run in the testing framework of Hume and Sunday [12]_CITE
Our solution based on filtration was compared with the BMH approach by Cho et al [5]_CITE (the authors generously let us use their implementation)

"The proof of Theorem 2.1 is given in [7]_CITE, Theorem 1 for the first part, and in [10]_CITE, Theorem 4.1 for the second part upon noticing that Conditions (3) and (7) together imply Conditions (A) and (C) in [10]_CITE"
In this section we present the application of the proposed methodology to the example of a power system consisting of one machine connected to a infinite bus; see [15]_CITE for more information regarding this model
An extensive overview is given in Long and Nelson [19]_CITE.
"The Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC), devised by Van de Weghe [26]_CITE, is a promising development towards this goal"
"To address this shortcoming, Van de Weghe [26]_CITE introduced the Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) to describe the relative motion of disconnected moving objects, providing an answer for many trajectory applications"

"Since this study was launched after the summer vacation for German college students and slightly after the launch date of iPhone 6 (Sep 19th, 2014), we adopted two realistic scenarios based on the findings of Krasnova_et_al._(2013)_CITE: one involved reading a post from a Facebook friend who posted a vacation picture, and, the other scenario involved a picture of a newly bought iPhone 6"
"The Rayleigh distribution has a PDF given by [12]_CITE: (1)pRayr=r 2exp-r22 20 r 0r<0,where r is the envelope amplitude of the received signal, is the rms value and 2 is the time-average power of the received signal before envelope detection"
"For the Rayleigh distribution the Mean can be obtained by [13,12]_CITE: (2)rmean=E[r]= 0 rp(r)dr= 2=1.2533 ,and the Mean Squared value by: (3)E[r2]= 0 r2p(r)dr=2 2,therefore, (4) 2=Er22.The Rayleigh PDF with respect to the instantaneous Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)( ) is obtained by [13,14]_CITE: (5)pRayr=1 exp- 0 r 0r<0.When a dominant non-fading signal component is present, such as LOS propagation path, the small-scale fading envelope is described by Rician fading distribution"
"The Rician is given by [12]_CITE: (6)pRicr=r 2exp-r2+A22 2IoAr 20 r 0r<0,where A denotes the peak amplitude of the dominant signal and Io ( ) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind and zero-order"

"See Burgess_(2008)_CITE and Moser_et al._(2008)_CITE for more comprehensive reviews of spatial cognition in the brain, and Kravitz,_Saleem,_Baker,_and_Mishkin_(2011)_CITE for an overview of areas associated with visuospatial processing."
"There is no well-established neural correlate of possible topological representations in the brain; although computational models with topological assumptions have successfully accounted for some hippocampal experimental data ( Chen,_Kloosterman,_Brown,_&_Wilson,_2012;_Dabaghian,_Cohn,_&_Frank,_2011_CITE) (and there is some neural evidence for the involvement of posterior parietal cortex (PPC) Calton_&_Taube,_2009_CITE and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) Epstein,_2008_CITE)."
"(See Kravitz_et al.,_2011_CITE for a detailed review of visuospatial processing in the brain.)"
"It has been argued that mathematically derived solutions to RL can plausibly be implemented in brains, based on the reward-relevant brain areas listed in the previous section (explaining RL and its correspondence to brains would exceed the scope of this paper; see Maia,_2009_CITE for an explanation and review of evidence)"
"Clarification of the following properties is also important in characterizing computational models of spatial memory (partially based on O Reilly,_1998_CITE and Webb,_2001_CITE 3 3Criteria specific to neuroscience and unimportant for characterizing purely cognitive models have been excluded.)"
"The spatial memory models reviewed in this section are divided into three categories, inspired by major modeling paradigms in the field of computational psychology ( Sun,_2008a_CITE)"
"The section symbolic spatial memory models describes models emphasizing explicit rules and localist representations based on symbolic logic ( Bringsjord,_2008_CITE)"
"(later extended in simulation as the BVC model by Barry_et al.,_2006_CITE)"
"One of the earliest definitions of such symbolic models has been put forth by Newell_and_Simon_(1976)_CITE, coining the term of a physical symbol system , a class of systems having symbols, being capable of manipulating them, and being realizable within our physical universe."
"There is evidence that spatial cues might be integrated statistically optimally in humans ( Nardini,_Jones,_Bedford,_&_Braddick,_2008_CITE) and animals ( Cheng,_Shettleworth,_Huttenlocher,_&_Rieser,_2007_CITE) on the behavioral level"
Building on work by Yeap_(1988)_CITE one of the first symbolic computational models of cognitive maps a number of robotic systems have been built (many of which have departed from the original claim of being computational theories of cognitive maps and will therefore be omitted)
"The idea of separate local and global representations is consistent with most empirical cognitive science research ( Hirtle_&_Jonides,_1985_CITE; Poucet,_1993_CITE; although there is some debate regarding whether and which mechanisms/areas are metric or topological)"
"In contrast to the previously described model, the robot by Jefferies_et al._(2008)_CITE used laser rangefinders as sensors (which provide more accuracy and resolution than simple sonar sensors)."
"This model is one of only two reviewed models capable of building a global map and of loop closing (the other being Beeson_et al.,_2010_CITE see below)."
"One of the first symbolic models of spatial memory in urban environments, growing out of the symbolic AI paradigm of the last century, was the NAVIGATOR model by Gopal,_Klatzky,_and_Smith_(1989)_CITE, implemented in LISP"
"Brom_et al._(2012)_CITE successfully replicate human data from two pointing paradigm experiments previously performed using their model, experiment 7 of Holmes_and_Sholl_(2005)_CITE, in which subjects learned the locations of objects in a room and then had to point to the remembered locations of the objects with their eyes closed after a 45 rotation left or right (both in an oriented and in a disoriented condition induced by slow rotation on a swiveling chair), and experiment 1 of Waller_and_Hodgson_(2006)_CITE, a similar pointing paradigm."
"Later extensions of the model which however have not been implemented on a real-world system include comparison to empirical data, electrophysiological data recorded from rats as well as human behavior data ( Barry_et al.,_2006_CITE) (the model could successfully account for the effect of changed environment size on both the firing fields of rat place cells and on object locations remembered by humans)."
"It succeeded in reproducing the empirically observed hierarchical cognitive maps by Hirtle_and_Jonides_(1985)_CITE, and also produced similar distance judgment errors as humans (distances spanning multiple clusters or submaps are overestimated both by humans and by the model)."
"The map-based path integrator (MPI) model by McNaughton_et al._(1996)_CITE was an influential and still highly relevant model of spatial representation and path integration in brains, implemented as a SNN"
"Another influential model was the BBB model proposed by Byrne_et al._(2007)_CITE and based on the BVC model ( Barry_et al.,_2006_CITE) (the predecessor of which was implemented on a robot, and reviewed in the previous subsection; Burgess_et al.,_2000_CITE)"
"More comprehensive reviews can be found in Duch,_Oentaryo,_and_Pasquier_(2008)_CITE, Goertzel,_Lian,_Arel,_de_Garis,_and_Chen_(2010)_CITE and Samsonovich_(2010)_CITE."
"The popular ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought Rational) cognitive architecture by Anderson,_Matessa,_and_Lebiere_(1997)_CITE follows a production-rule based approach (productions consist of sensory preconditions or IF statements, and associated actions or THEN statements executed when the precondition matches the state of the world)"
"CLARION has succeeded in modeling human behavior data from a large number of paradigms including the above mentioned minefield navigation task and thus can be called cognitively plausible ( Sun_&_Zhang,_2004_CITE)."
"The model by Barrera_et al._(2011)_CITE is notable because although it cannot close the loop and cannot perform global mapping, it can learn a real-world maze with a learning curve similar to rats, using a model that is highly structurally similar to rat brains."
"However, none of these models have evaluated their transformation mechanism against empirical data, with the exception of the neural network model by Byrne_et al._(2007)_CITE (which seems to predict heavily coordinated and correlated activity in the neural correlates of transformation, ie the RSC; but such activity has been not observed)."
"The BVC model ( Barry_et al.,_2006_CITE) is an example computational model successfully predicting the firing activity of spatially relevant neurons in single-unit recordings."
"ACT-R major modules have been mapped to brain areas (such as the imaginal module to the posterior parietal region, or the central pattern matcher to the basal ganglia), and a suitable mapping function has been devised that converts activity in these modules into activation patterns resembling fMRI data ( Qin_et al.,_2007_CITE), and more recently, EEG data ( Motomura,_Ojima,_&_Zhong,_2009_CITE), successfully predicting brain activity in novel circumstances ( Anderson_et al.,_2008_CITE)."
More information on graphical methods for classifier performance assessment can be found in [32]_CITE.
"The interested reader can consult, for instance, the work of Domingos [10]_CITE for more information on the issues related to bias and variance."
"For this reason, in the literature, some proposals have been made to introduce unbiased measures see in particular the work of Flach [16]_CITE."
"Franco_and_Meadows_(2007)_CITE indicated that McGrath's_(1984)_CITE circumplex is the most accepted framework for group decision support, theory, and research"
"Following Landsman_and_Stremersch_(2011)_CITE, we investigated multi-homing by dividing it into two levels: seller- and platform-level multi-homing"
"We used Levenshtein distance ( Levenshtein,_1966_CITE) to measure the similarity of two names and employed Python's difflib library 3 3Python v2.7.3"
"When examining multi-homing at the level of the whole content of the three ecosystems, our findings support Sun_and_Tse's_(2009_CITE) assertion that the market would evolve into one dominant ecosystem."
Dixon and Coles [8]_CITE were the first to evaluate the strength of football teams for the purpose of generating profit against published market odds with the use of a time-dependent Poisson regression model based on Maher [26]_CITE model
"However, Constantinou and Fenton [5]_CITE later developed a novel rating technique (called pi-rating) that outperformed considerably the two ELO rating variants of [21]_CITE, in terms of profitability, over a period of five EPL season."
"Forecasts were published online [29]_CITE prior to the start of each match, and this was the first academic study to demonstrate profitability that was consistent against published market odds over a sufficiently high number of betting trials without eliminating the bookmakers profit margin."
"In this paper we present a Bayesian network model for forecasting football outcomes that is based on the approach in [7]_CITE, but with reduced complexity and higher forecasting capability (which we explain in detail in Sections 2 4)"
As in [7]_CITE we have used the AgenaRisk Bayesian network tool to build the model
"To examine genre and ways of perceiving, we used specific eye movement behavior metrics or ocular metrics ( Rayner,_1998_CITE) which have been in fairly common use in contemporary eye tracking experiments ie Scanpath Duration and Scanpath Length, c.f"
"More discussion of the definitions can be read in Clark,_Ruthven,_&_Holt_(2009a,_pp._3 6)_CITE"
"Lorigo_et_al._(2006)_CITE, in an extension of the work in Pan_et_al._(2004)_CITE, used scanpath fixations pattern-finding to compare the differences in gender and task type during a web search"
"After reviewing the very comprehensive and popular eyetracking scanpaths metrics in Goldberg_&_Kotval_(1999),_Goldberg_et_al._(2002),_Salvucci_&_Goldberg_(2000),_&_Poole_&_J_Ball_(2005)_CITE and comparing with the research questions and aims of the evaluation we decided on the two metrics: scanpath duration Fig_5 and scanpath length Fig_6 which also complemented our previous work"
"Skimming and scanning: The techniques were detected using the methodology employed in Campbell_&_Maglio_(2001,_p._3)_CITE and Buscher,_Dengel,_van_Elst,_and_Mittag_(2008)_CITE, with some modifications"
"Just like Watt_(2009,_chap._8)_CITE in his timed response design we balanced for length and still found a very strong effect (an interaction between layout representations) which indicated that genre speed was a factor independent of length, as in Clark,_Ruthven,_&_Holt_(2009b)_and_Clark_et_al._(2010)_CITE"
"This work is a continuation of the previous pilot studies conducted by Toms_and_Campbell_(1999b)_CITE and the later study carried out by Watt_(2009,_chap._8)_CITE on the findings of Toms and Campbell, to examine the importance of form and purpose (or function, which Toms and Campbell referred to as being synonymous with content) in communities of practice, but with the inclusion of more data"
"However, since the prioneering work of Lord et al [72]_CITE, the proposal of similarity measures for genomics and proteomics based on the Gene Ontology (GO) [5]_CITE have attracted a lot of attention, as detailed in a recent survey on the topic [76]_CITE"
"In [57]_CITE, Lastra-D az and Garc a-Serrano introduce a new family of similarity measures based on an Information Content (IC) model, whose pioneering work is introduced by Resnik [108]_CITE"
"Their new familiy of semantic similarity measures is based on two unexplored notions: a non-linear normalization of the classic Jiang-Conrath distance [52]_CITE, and a generalization of this latter distance on non tree-like taxonomies defined as the length of the shortest path within an IC-weigthed taxonomy"
"One of the similarity measures introduced in [57]_CITE, called coswJ&Csim, obtains the best results on the RG65 dataset"
"This latter family of IC models is refined in another subsequent paper [58]_CITE, which also sets out the new state of the art and confirms the outperformance of the coswJ&Csim similarity measure in a statistically significant manner among the family of ontology-based semantic similarity measures based on WordNet."
"The main aim of this work is to introduce the PosetHERep representation model and make the Half-Edge Semantic Measures Library (HESML ) publicly available for the first time, together with a set of reproducible experiments whose aims are the exact replication of the three aforementioned experimental surveys [56 58]_CITE, as well as the proposal for a self-contained experimental platform which can be easily used for extensive experimentation, even with no software coding"
"In addition, this work also introduces a new replication framework and the WNSimRep v1 dataset for the first time provided as supplementary material in [63]_CITE, whose aim is to provide a gold standard to assist in the exact replication of ontology-based similarity measures and IC models"
"Finally, we have carried-out a series of experiments in order to evaluate the scalability and peformance of HESML as regards the Semantic Measures Library (SML) [48]_CITE and WNetSS [15]_CITE, which sets out the current state of the art"
"This work is part of a novel innitiative on computational reproducibility recently introduced by Chirigati et al [26]_CITE, whose pioneering work is introduced by Wolke et al [127]_CITE with the aim of leading to the exact replication of several dynamic resource allocation strategies in cloud data centers evaluated in a companion paper [128]_CITE."
Section 4 introduces a set of reproducible experiments as a companion work to the aforementioned works introduced by Lastra-D az and Garc a-Serrano [56 58]_CITE
"Section 5 briefly introduces the WNSimRep v1 dataset, which is detailed and made publicly available in [63]_CITE as complementary material"
"However, for an in-depth review of the latter topics, we refer the reader to the reviews by Lastra-D az and Garc a-Serrano on IC-based similarity measures [57]_CITE and IC models [56,58]_CITE, as well as the short review by Batet and S nchez [12]_CITE and the book by Harispe et al [49]_CITE."
"First, edge-counting measures, the so-called path-based measures, whose core idea is the use of the length of the shortest path between concepts as an estimation of their degree of similarity, such as the pioneering work of Rada et al [107]_CITE"
"Second, the family of IC-based similarity measures, whose core idea is the use of an Information Content (IC) model, such as the pioneering work of Resnik [108]_CITE, and the subsequent measures introduced by Jiang and Conrath [52]_CITE and Lin [70]_CITE"
"Third, the familiy of feature-based similarity measures, whose core idea is the use of set-theory operators between the feature sets of the concepts, such as the pioneering work of Tversky [124]_CITE"
"And fourth, other similarity measures that cannot be directly categorized into any previous family, which are based on similarity graphs derived from WordNet [122]_CITE, novel contributions of the hyponym set [43]_CITE, or aggregations of other measures [75]_CITE."
"The first known IC model is based on corpus statistics and was introduced by Resnik [108]_CITE, and subsequently detailed in [109]_CITE"
"To bridge this gap, Seco et al [119]_CITE introduce the first intrinsic IC model in the literature, whose core hypothesis is that the IC models can be directly computed from intrinsic taxonomical features"
"Among the main intrinsic and corpus-based IC models proposed in the literature, we find the proposals by Zhou et al [133]_CITE, Sebti and Barfroush [118]_CITE, Blanchard et al [18]_CITE, S nchez et al [114]_CITE [113]_CITE, Meng et al [82]_CITE, Yuan et al [131]_CITE, Hadj Taieb et al [42]_CITE, Lastra-D az and Garc a-Serrano [56,58]_CITE, Adhikari et al [1]_CITE, Aouicha et al [4,16]_CITE, and Harispe et al [46]_CITE."
"Finally, in another recent work, Jiang et al [53]_CITE introduce a new intrinsic IC model based on the Wikipedia category structure which has obtained outstanding results in several word-similarity benchmarks"
"The main publicly available software libraries focusing on the implementation of ontology-based similarity measures based on WordNet areWordNet::Similarity (WNSim) [99]_CITE and WS4J [121]_CITE, whose development is more stable, and the Semantic Measures Library (SML) [47]_CITE and the recent WNetSS [15]_CITE which are active ongoing projects."
"The pioneering WNSim library was developed in Perl by Pedersen et al [99]_CITE, and subsequently migrated to Java by Tedeki Shima, under the name of WS4J [121]_CITE"
"On the other hand, Harispe et al [47]_CITE introduce the aforementioned SML library, which is the largest semantic measures library"
"In order to make the experimental work with HESML easier, as well as supporting the reproducible experiments detailed in section 4, HESML is distributed as a self-contained development and testing platform including the set of complementary resources shown in table 22 in appendix, which includes three different WordNet 3 3HYPERLINK versions, a WordNet-based frequency file dataset developed by Ted Pedersen [95]_CITE, and the five most significant word similarity benchmarks"
"The method is a classic Dijkstra algorithm based on a min-priority queue [25,79]_CITE and the aforementioned PosetHERep vertex iteration loop in order to efficiently traverse the graph"
"We follow the same experimental setup as that detailed in [56]_CITE and [58]_CITE, including the same datasets, preprocessing steps, evaluation metrics, baselines, management of polysemic words and reporting of the results"
"For a comparison of these two types of virtualization platform, we refer the reader to the survey introduced by Merkel [84]_CITE, in which the author introduces Docker and compares it with classic Virtual Machines (VM) such as VirtualBox."
"Finally, table 16 summarizes the software platforms in which the reproducible experiments [64]_CITE have been successfully reproduced."
"The WNSimRep v1 dataset is part of the experimental data reported in our three aforementioned works [56 58]_CITE, and it was automatically generated using HESML as detailed in section 4.3.1."
"WNSimRep v1 includes three different types of data files: (1) node-valued IC data files with taxonomical features, (2) edge-valued IC data files with the conditional probability between child and parent concepts, and (3) synset-pair-valued data files with taxonomical features and IC-based similarity measures for the synset pairs derived from the classic RG65 benchmark introduced by [111]_CITE"
"The concept of loss aversion is also well documented within the psychology literature [20]_CITE, with individuals motivated to avoid potential losses in the future"
"As such, the findings of Vishwanath et al [41]_CITE, whereby the presence of urgency cues monopolised attentional resources also appears to differentially apply to other influence techniques (ie, authority) and be impacted to a degree, although not entirely, by the availability of cognitive resource"
"As a result, decision support systems that reduce the impact of these heuristic processes via user-centred design would benefit from further development (eg, [33]_CITE)"
"First, we consider the algorithmic level and use a speech database to assess the usefulness of OT features as compared to standard features used in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) that are based on cepstral coefficients ( Rabiner_&_Juang,_1993_CITE)"
"Second, we propose a more generic model of transient synchronization based on a Weakly Coupled Oscillator (WCO) framework ( Hoppensteadt_&_Izhikevich,_1997_CITE)"
"WCOs are a standard approach for studying synchronization dynamics ( Hoppensteadt_&_Izhikevich,_1997_CITE) and can be derived by applying a phase reduction approach to neurophysiologically realistic neural ( Gutkin,_Ermentrout,_&_Reyes,_2005_CITE) or neural network ( Brown,_Moehlis,_&_Holmes,_2004_CITE) models"
"This is based on previous work ( Canolty_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
"There has since been a large amount of work in this area with reviews focusing on its role in large-scale integration ( Varela,_Lachaux,_Rodriguez,_&_Martinerie,_2001_CITE), enhanced communication ( Fries,_2005_CITE), attention and memory ( Jensen,_Kaiser,_&_Lachaux,_2007_CITE) and spike-timing dependent plasticity ( Buzsaki,_2006_CITE)"
"This extends previous findings from fMRI ( Binder_et al.,_2000_CITE) and provides evidence for a degree of seriality in word processing"
"These factors are described in a recent comprehensive review ( Wang,_2010_CITE)"
"Mathematical studies of coupled oscillators show that for fast interactions, synchronization is most readily achieved using excitatory connections ( Vreeswijk,_Abbott,_&_Ermentrout,_1994_CITE)"
Further details of the MTF processing are given in Canolty_et al._(2007)_CITE
Fig_3 demonstrates the same concept as Fig_2 in Hopfield_and_Brody_(2001)_CITE but uses a WCO rather than IF network
This is discussed at length in Hopfield_and_Brody_(2001)_CITE and illustrated in Fig_5
"These were based on previous models of visual attention ( Niebur_&_Koch,_1994_CITE) and image segmentation ( Wang_&_Terman,_1997_CITE) that also made use of synchronizing dynamics."
"The instantaneous field power is then given by ( Roweis,_2009_CITE) (6) y(x,t)2 =1+e t2(K 1)"
"(3)) using the Euler Maruyama method ( Kloeden_&_Platen,_1999_CITE) to compute the phase time series for the network of oscillators, k, and then use Eq (5) to produce the field response"
"The posterior density was then estimated using a Metropolis Hastings (MH) algorithm ( Gelman,_Carlin,_Stern,_&_Rubin,_1995_CITE)"
"MFCCs form the front-end of state-of- the-art speech recognition systems such as HTK ( Woodland,_2003_CITE) and Sphinx-4 ( Walker,_Lamere,_Kwok,_Raj,_&_Singh,_2004_CITE)"
"To simplify the comparison of MFCC and OT features they were both fed into an identical pattern recognition stage, chosen to be a first nearest neighbour classifier ( Duda_&_Hart,_1973_CITE)."
"We used the multiple speaker isolated word database described in Hopfield_and_Brody_(2000,_2001)_CITE"
"This data is a subset of the TI46 database from the Linguistic Data Consortium ( Verstraeten,_Schrauwen,_Stroobandt,_&_Campenhout,_2005_CITE)"
"We then improved the system by introducing multiple level detectors for each onset and offset feature, as proposed in Gutig_and_Sompolinsky_(2009)_CITE"
"MFCC features are much more powerful when used in combination with an HMM classifier ( Woodland,_2003_CITE), and OT features when used with a recognition process such as a Tempotron ( Gutig_&_Sompolinsky,_2009_CITE)"
This work is based heavily on prior developments by Hopfield_and_Brody_(2001)_CITE and we have made three novel contributions to the literature.
"Our results are more in line with those of Rouat,_Loiselle,_and_Molotchnikoff_(2011)_CITE who obtained word error rates of 78% when training an MFCC HMM system on clean utterances and testing it on 10 dB noisy utterances using noise samples from Aurora-2."
"Extension of our modelling to include multiple regions, as in Corchs_and_Deco_(2004);_Husain_et al._(2004)_CITE, is therefore an important direction for future work."
"The MFCCs were derived using a standard data processing pipeline ( Gutig_&_Sompolinsky,_2009_CITE)"
"One successful example of this type of commoditization in computational chemistry is the Plumed [9]_CITE package that integrates with a number of different molecular dynamics packages for free energy sampling, which has enabled a number of teams to scale molecular dynamics to very large resources [10,11]_CITE."
"Since the dataflow execution engine is described in detail elsewhere [33]_CITE, Section 5 only provides a brief explanation of how it works and interoperates with the p2p network."
"Swift [40]_CITE combined with Falkon [22]_CITE performs well and produces a job throughput of 56 jobs/s, which is the result of writing a custom programming model to handle parallel execution"
"Millwheel [25]_CITE and Naiad [23]_CITE are two very powerful dataflow systems that support streaming data analysis, which makes it possible to express an operation to analyse it in real time"
"Swift [26]_CITE is a programming model that provides a very complete feature set including dynamic dataflows, iteration and strong typing which allows type checking"
"Many popular commercial CDNs such as Akamai [43]_CITE and PA-CDNs such as NetSession, Spotify, LiveSky, Tudou and kankan, rely on DNS redirection mechanism."
"For more information, the interested readers are referred to [79]_CITE."

"The Block Transfer model (BT) [27]_CITE addresses this deficiency by defining that a block of consecutive locations can be copied from memory to memory, taking one unit of time per element after the initial access time"
"Thus, they simplified and reduced the MH parameters by putting forward a new Uniform Memory Hierarchy (UMH) model [28,29]_CITE"
"Later, an ideal-cache model was introduced in [23,24]_CITE allowing analysis of cache-oblivious algorithms that use asymptotically optimal amounts of work and move data asymptotically optimally among multiple levels of cache without the necessity of tuning program variables according to hardware configuration parameters."
"Quite different to PRAM, the Bulk-Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model [34]_CITE attempts to bridge theory and practice by allowing processors to work asynchronously, and it models latency and limited bandwidth for distributed memory machines without shared memory"

"Meantime, Baghsorkhi et al [16]_CITE measure performance factors in isolation and later combine them to model the overall performance via workflow graphs so that the interactive effects between different performance factors are modeled correctly"
"For instance, the early work [49]_CITE proposes a generic architecture for grid workflow systems that is based on the workflow reference model defined by the Workflow Management Coalition"
Our formalization improves on the certifier for tree automata completion by Boyer et al [2]_CITE in that we can handle non-left-linear systems.
"To demonstrate this, we provide examples where the techniques of [12,13,19]_CITE are successfully applied when state-compatible automata are used, but where the techniques must fail if they are restricted to use the compatibility criteria of Genet or Korp and Middeldorp"
"Following [13]_CITE, we formulate Genet's result from [7]_CITE as follows:"
"To overcome this problem, Korp and Middeldorp introduced quasi-deterministic automata [13]_CITE (cf"
"Using [3,_Exercise_1.12.2]_CITE, which shows that it is NP-hard to decide whether an instance of a term l is accepted by a tree automaton A, we can show that deciding whether the language accepted by a deterministic automaton is closed under rewriting by a given TRS is co-NP-hard"
"To this end, we need the following key lemma, a slight generalization of [13,_Lemma_20]_CITE, which shows that a quasi-deterministic automaton A is almost deterministic: all but the last step in a reduction can be performed using the deterministic d transitions"
"The proof is identical to the proof of [13,_Lemma_20]_CITE, except when ti in t=f(t1, ,tn) is a state"
"To overcome this problem, we follow [13]_CITE and consider a special rewrite relation which allows to adjust labels for matching non-left-linear rules"
"On the analyzer side we have extended the termination tool Image 1 [11]_CITE and the confluence tool CSI [19]_CITE to produce state-coherent, state-compatible automata"
"In fact, for some algorithms we just relied on the automatic refinement provided in [16]_CITE which turns set operations into operations on trees"
"For example, we group the transitions of an automaton by their root symbols and store these groups in ordered trees using Isabelle's collection framework [15]_CITE"

Zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis proposed by Bogdanov and Rijmen in [4]_CITE is a novel promising attack technique for block ciphers which has its theoretical foundation in the availability of numerous key-independent unbiased linear approximations with correlation zero for many ciphers
"Compared with the previous best attack proposed in [14]_CITE, our attack on 27-round HIGHT has a lower time complexity and successfully eliminates the requirements for unpractical memory."
"A systematic review of empirical research published before 2005 revealed a lack of theoretical and methodological rigor ( Dyb _and_Dings yr,_2008_CITE)"
"A systematic review of empirical studies published until 2005 ( Dyb _and_Dings yr,_2008_CITE) called for an increase in both the number and quality of studies"
Exhaustive reviews of circular molecular structures can be found in [7]_CITE and [14]_CITE.
Maes designed an elegant divide-and-conquer algorithm which runs in time O(mnlogm) [18]_CITE
"An exact branch and bound algorithm based on Maes algorithm, which runs in time O(mnlogm), was proposed by Barrachina and Marzal [2]_CITE"
One of the first ones is the Bunke and Buhler ( BBA) algorithm [6]_CITE
We give some further definitions following Ukkonen [29]_CITE
Grossi et al [13]_CITE presented an exact algorithm to compute the -blockwise q-gram distance between x and y
To this end we make use of the Needleman Wunsch algorithm [25]_CITE to compute a similarity score for each rotation of string x and string y
Myers bit-vector algorithm was implemented using the SeqAn library [9]_CITE
"DNA datasets were simulated using INDELible [10]_CITE, which produces sequences in a (Multi)FASTA file"
Handwritten digits from the MNIST database [16]_CITE were also used and sorted into ten sets
It is an extension of the q-gram based algorithm presented in [13]_CITE adapted for cyclic edit distance computation
"Linear dynamical system (LDS) models are amongst the most popular and powerful, because of their intuitive nature and ease of implementation [15]_CITE"
"The famous Kalman Filter-Smoother is one of the most popular and powerful tools for time-series prediction with an LDS, given known parameters [14]_CITE."
"Sid is, in fact, a generalization of the now classic Baum-Welch expectation maximization algorithm, commonly used for system identification in much lower dimensional linear dynamical systems [20]_CITE"
The EM algorithm for a standard LDS is detailed in Zoubin and Geoffrey (1996) [11]_CITE
"The data are preprocessed with FSL, a comprehensive library of analysis tools for fMRI, MRI, and DTI brain imaging data [23]_CITE"
A comprehensive introduction of the dataset is given by [26]_CITE.
"To determine the number of latent states, d, the profile likelihood method proposed by Zhu et al [30]_CITE is utilized"
"We note that in the constant viscosity case, the heuristic statement of incompressible Reynolds equation from Stokes model is obtained in [2]_CITE while the more rigorous one based on asymptotic developments is proved in [3]_CITE."
"More recently, by assuming that the viscosity depends on pressure in Stokes equation according to Barus law, in [12]_CITE a more careful derivation of the limit Reynolds equation is carried out"
"After some simplifying assumptions detailed in [12]_CITE, including that p/ y=0, Eqs"
"Furthermore, by using the simplification (7) u x duavdx,where uav is an average velocity, the flow rate (8)Q=h(x)uav(x)is introduced in [12]_CITE to deduce the following modified Reynolds equation (9)ddxh3 + Qdh2dxdpdx=6sdhdx.Next, for the case of the hydrodynamic and elastohydrodynamic lubrication of a long cylinder rolling on a plane, in [12]_CITE the effect of the extra term appearing in the modified equation with respect to the classical one is numerically investigated"
This phenomenon is defined in [14]_CITE as the rupture of the continuous fluid film due to the formation of air bubbles inside
"For different from 0, there exists only one partial result in [17]_CITE, in which existence and uniqueness is proved for the equation, under very strong assumptions on the data"
"Concerning the alternative first order ODE model, it is based on some classical results in [18]_CITE for the Reynolds solution in the isoviscous regime"
"More precisely, in [18]_CITE it is proved that cavitation can only occur in the divergent part of the gap (ie the region where dh/dt>0) and that the cavitated area is a connected one"
The numerical solutions for the problem (25) (27) may be obtained by the combination of finite element techniques with a classical projection method [19]_CITE or a more complex duality type algorithm proposed in [20]_CITE
"The application of these techniques to classical piezoviscous formulations can be found in [6 8,21]_CITE, for example"
"Some convergence results have been proved in [20]_CITE under the constraint 1/2, so that here we take =1/2 in all tests."
"In this research we tackle the former point; inspired by work in Scene Modelling ( Makris_and_Ellis,_2005_CITE) and Social Signal Processing ( Cristani_and_Raghavendra,_2012_CITE) we demonstrate the extraction and use of high level surveillance information which provides a contextual basis to identify subtly abnormal behaviour"
"For a more general discussion on contextual anomaly detection see ( Chandola,_2009;_Song_et_al.,_2007_CITE)."
"For a comprehensive and complete review of the emerging field of social signal processing see the work of Cristani ( Cristani_and_Raghavendra,_2012_CITE)."
"for the second dataset, the Oxford data, we use the published tracking results provided by Benfold ( Benfold_and_Video,_2011_CITE)"
"The pedestrian tracking performance of the TLD tracker is extensively tested against alternative recent tracking procedures in the author paper ( Kalal_and_Matas,_2010_CITE)."
"For a detailed account of this work see ( Hospedales_and_Xiang,_2011_CITE)"
A great deal of works has been carried out on various aspects of fluid flow and heat transfer over a stretching sheet since the pioneering work of Sakiadis [1]_CITE and Crane [2]_CITE
"The main model used in this paper is Petri nets [25,26]_CITE as they provide a framework in which both state-based and action-based system information is represented explicitly, and also because they had been extensively used in the past to treat persistence and nonviolence"
"A part of the technical development will be formulated in terms of more general transition systems [17]_CITE which provide a semantical link between Petri nets and other concurrency models, eg, process calculi."
We follow the basic variant of the step sequence approach often referred to as the single-server semantics [15]_CITE where steps are sets of executed actions
"Moreover, in the context of Petri nets with time, the single-server semantics means that a single clock is assigned to an action and, as argued in [15]_CITE, such an approach has been used most widely for modelling real-time concurrent computing systems"
"There are several structurally defined and extensively applied persistent sub-classes of Petri nets, including choice-free nets [14,30]_CITE, marked graphs [8]_CITE, and MTS nets [5,16,22]_CITE demonstrated that persistence (together with other properties) guarantees separability which means that a Petri net can be seen and verified as a composition of finitely many concurrently operating independent copies of much simpler net [6,7]_CITE presented a way in which persistent nets can be synthesised and re-engineered from finite transition systems."
The original motivation for the work presented here came from a challenge to deal with the design of asynchronous circuits [10]_CITE
"An attractive compromise turns out to be mixed synchronous-asynchronous GALS design [29]_CITE, where a digital system is divided into hazard-free synchronous islands communicating asynchronously using potentially hazardous handshake mechanism."
An alternative proof of Proposition 8.1 can be found in [13]_CITE (stated there as Proposition 4.6).
"In the first part of this paper, we extended and revised the taxonomy of nonviolent and persistent steps and markings proposed in [18]_CITE"
"However, considering that the first academic articles discussing analytics were published in the early 2000s (eg Kohavi,_Rothleder,_&_Simoudis_(2002)_CITE), the tardiness of the OR/MS academic community response is surprising enough to warrant further exploration of the underlying causes."
"Perhaps the most cited definition of analytics is that provided by Davenport_and_Harris_(2007,_p._7)_CITE: [T]he extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models, and fact-based management to drive decisions and actions"
"The most prevalent of such definitions is proposed in Lustig,_Dietrich,_Johnson,_and_Dziekan_(2010)_CITE, who argue that analytics comprises of three distinct aspects: Descriptive analytics: statistical methods designed to explore what happened? Predictive analytics: machine learning methods designed to predict what will happen next? Prescriptive analytics: OR/MS methods designed to answer what should the business do next?"
"In Decision Support Systems, arguably the area most influential book of its era, Keen_and_Scott_Morton_(1978,_pp._33 34)_CITE propose that four disciplines are integral: computer science, information economics, management science and behavioral science"
"However, in its modern-day counterpart, Competing on Analytics ( Davenport_&_Harris,_2007_CITE), there are only two direct mention of OR/MS, but a total of 59 mentions of the terms statistics and statistical"
"World War Two was a period of significant innovation, most famously in Bletchley Park where Colossus, the first programmable digital computer, and decryption machines (such as Alan Turing Bombe) were created ( Flowers,_1983;_Randell,_1972_CITE)"
"Similarly the work of Edward Tizard, Patrick Blackett and the Aeronautical Research Committee, arguably the originators of the OR/MS discipline, played a significant influence on Britain war effort ( Kirby,_2003;_Ormerod,_1999_CITE), as well as many of the quantitative methods of the dianoetic management paradigm"
"In Germany Konrad Zuse created the Z1 (the first digital computer) predating Colossus by two years ( Giloi,_1998_CITE), whilst mathematics became increasingly important in military operations of the US ( Rees,_1980_CITE) and Canada ( Laporte,_2008_CITE)."
"Arguably it was the latter of these which had the greatest public impact by successfully predicting the 1952 US presidential election ( Ceruzzi,_1999_CITE)"
"The decision making aspect of the paradigm also came to prominence, with research conducted at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and MIT, and publications from Simon_(1965)_and_Anthony_(1965)_CITE particularly influential ( Power,_2007_CITE)"
"Alongside this more general work into the interface between man-and-machine , notable research was published by Scott_Morton_(1969)_and_Ferguson_and_Jones_(1969)_CITE into how practical system can be devised that would better support decision making."
"Elsewhere, attempts were made to create solutions to wicked problems ( Churchman,_1967_CITE); problems which are harder to structure and define due to conflicting perspectives amongst relevant stakeholders"
"In particular, US consumer goods giant Proctor &#38; Gamble, in conjunction with Metaphor Computer Systems, were instrumental in demonstrating the value and the methodology of a new form of architecture ( Nylund,_1999_CITE)"
The use of such metrics as management tools had become popularised by Kaplan_and_Norton s_(1992)_CITE balanced scorecard
"In business, the term is first used around 2000 (eg Whiting,_2000_CITE), and in the context of BI software"
"Secondly, there have been many efforts to provide decision support and automation in real-time (eg Davenport_&_Harris,_2007;_Niedermann,_Radesch tz,_&_Mitschang,_2011_CITE)"
"Methods such as simulation have long utilised graphical displays for these purposes ( Hurrion,_1976_CITE) and whilst there has been research into their design and use (eg Belton_&_Elder,_1994_CITE), further studies into best practices, in particular with respect to recent visualisation work should be encouraged"
"In the OR literature the Viable Systems Model (VSM) ( Beer,_1972,_1979_CITE, 1985_CITE) has been frequently used as a lens to explore this type of adaptive organisational complexity in a variety of contexts such as: national innovation ( Devine,_2005_CITE); public sector planning ( Clemens,_2009_CITE); virtual enterprises ( Assimakopoulos_&_Dimitriou,_2006_CITE); environmental sustainability ( Espinosa,_Harnden,_&_Walker,_2008_CITE); purchasing ( Azadeh,_Darivandi,_&_Fathi,_2012_CITE); disaster response ( Preece,_Shaw,_&_Hayashi,_2013,_2015_CITE); eco-community development ( Espinosa_&_Walker,_2013_CITE); service management ( Badinelli_et_al.,_2012_CITE), policing ( Brocklesby,_2012_CITE) and planning information systems in a UK Police Authority ( Kinloch,_Francis,_Francis,_&_Taylor,_2009_CITE)."
"Although case studies have been found to help it has been argued that there are few available that provide this guidance particularly in relation to some of the more detailed nuances of practice ( Ackermann,_2012_CITE, p_652)."
"Bar-Noy,_Bhatia,_Naor,_and_Schieber_(2002a)_CITE prove that the problem of finding a feasible perfect periodic schedule is an NP-hard problem in general"
"The following useful result follows directly from the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) ( Jones_&_Jones,_1998_CITE, Theorem 3.12)"
It was first proposed by Rescher and Manor already in 1970 [92]_CITE
A commonly accepted set of postulates for judging a logic-based merging operator was proposed in [68]_CITE
"These axioms (like those in the AGM theory of revision [2]_CITE) are directly inspired by choice function theory (see [16]_CITE for such a connexion) which defines axioms for the selection of best items from subsets of options, such that there exists a preference relation that can justify these choices"
"This way of envisaging knowledge-based fusion is explained in more details by Benferhat et al [7]_CITE, who show it comes down to merging possibilistic logic bases (see Section 6.3)."
An extensive overview of fusion methods in possibility theory appears in [52]_CITE.
"The reader is referred to the literature for details on this topic, especially the works of Benferhat and colleagues [7,8,11,12,62]_CITE as well as Liu and colleagues [75,75,89 91,117]_CITE."
".The most celebrated fusion rule is an associative operation called Dempster rule of combination [27,97]_CITE"
"Yager [113]_CITE proposed another form of renormalisation that ensures a strongly internally consistent result, while making the combination applicable to any pair of bba s, by reassigning the mass mS( ) to the whole set W"
"The recordings were taken from the evaluated motivational feedback corpus MOTI ( Wolff_&_Brechmann,_2012_CITE) which includes neutral, praising, blaming, and sympathetic prosodies for the evaluative feedback utterances employed here (ie, ja, richtig, etc.; see above) as well as for six pseudowords (words without semantic content) and was evaluated by 24 German native speakers (12 female) aged 20 35 years"
"The natural speech stimuli we employed stemmed from a corpus recorded from three female and three male speakers ( Wolff_&_Brechmann,_2012_CITE), and recordings from one of the female speakers were chosen based on high recognition rates in the manipulation check (see Section 2.2)"
The method commonly used for image background extraction is to select thresholds based on image color spaces [16]_CITE
"Although good performance was achieved by the method of watershed transform (derived from the morphology) using the image of region of interest for non-uniform images [14,15]_CITE, we keep our approach simple for three main reasons"
The details of the GP can be found in [22]_CITE.
The HSV transformation is widely used in image analysis for texture extraction [16]_CITE
"Using each of the best feature functions with the same MDC, the average accuracy rates over the ten-fold test sets are reported in Table 4 for the CDF-DRVC/GP-EM framework and are compared to the performance of the HROIT/GP-EM framework [37,38]_CITE"
"As a result of the CD implementation, we have achieved huge benefits, as summarized in Table 1 (these were reported in an earlier paper ( Chen,_2015_CITE))."
"In this paper we propose a method to convert a Java execution trace into a sequence of states that can be analyzed by the model checker Spin ( Holzmann,_2003_CITE)"
"Specifically, we combine the Spin model checker ( Holzmann,_2003_CITE) and the runtime debugging API Java Debug Interface (JDI) ( Java_Platform_Debugger_Architecture,_xxxx_CITE)"
"Both modules are integrated as a new Eclipse ( Eclipse_development_environment,_xxxx_CITE) plug-in for automatic debugging"
"This paper is an extension of previous work of ours presented in ( Adalid_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"To illustrate our proposal we use an FTP server ( Sorotokin,_xxxx_CITE)"
"However, the most interesting set of properties are complex requirements described with linear temporal logic (LTL) ( Manna_and_Pnueli,_1992_CITE)."
"Each Java execution is carried out in the target platform under the control of our runtime monitoring module, which has been implemented in Java using JDI ( Java_Platform_Debugger_Architecture,_xxxx_CITE)"
"When Java executions are finite, we take advantage of the stuttering mechanism implemented in Spin ( Holzmann,_2003_CITE), and we assume the semantics derived from considering the last state of the trace repeated forever"
"We are currently evaluating an extension of the memory representation described in ( Gallardo_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"The most notable tools for analyzing Java programs using some variant of full-state model checking are Bandera ( Corbett_et_al.,_2000_CITE) and Java PathFinder ( Visser_et_al.,_2003_CITE)"
"Java PathFinder ( Havelund_and_Pressburger,_2000_CITE) (JPF) is a complete model checker for Java programs that performs a complete coverage of a program, while our testing tool does a partial analysis of the program"
"However, it is important to note that, as shown in modified equation analysis [22]_CITE, the grid does effectively alter the equation set being solved"
Descriptions of the underlying logical arguments necessary to generate these meshes can be found in [27]_CITE.
The wide range of available filters in the table can be found in [10]_CITE
"For example, instances of under-resolved simulations can be readily found [28]_CITE"
The dynamic system f c( z) = z 2 + c is called Mandelbrot set (M-set) [1]_CITE as Mandelbrot first proposed it in 1982
"The weighted version of the straight skeleton, where edges no longer move at unit speed, was first mentioned by Eppstein and Erickson [2]_CITE and studied in detail by Biedl et al [4,5]_CITE"
"In the present work, in order to deal with the rotational motion after breaking, a new set of 2D horizontal Boussinesq-type of equations have been derived which include the effects of vorticity, by extending the 1D fully nonlinear approach of Musumeci et al [22]_CITE, in order to develop a model able to deal with combined wave-current motion often forced by the presence of natural and artificial complex bathymetry conditions"
In their classical paper Nadaoka et al [25]_CITE analysed the turbulent structures under spilling breaking waves
"As far as extended Boussinesq models are concerned, a widely adopted numerical solution strategy is the one proposed by Wei et al [2]_CITE, who successfully applied a fifth-order finite difference scheme for the spatial derivatives and a third-order predictor, fourth-order corrector scheme for the integration in time, known in the literature as Adams Bashforth Moulton or ABM scheme"
Another approach has been introduced more recently by S rensen et al [35]_CITE which bases the individuation of the toe of the roller on the time derivative of the free surface elevation
Therefore we adopt a new approach in our work which is similar to that of S rensen et al [34]_CITE and which is described below.
"In particular, the experimental data of Hansen and Svendsen [36]_CITE on the breaking of cnoidal waves has been used as a benchmark"
"In order to qualitatively validate the proposed model capabilities in estimating vorticity, the model of Dimakopoulos and Dimas [38]_CITE has been taken into account"
"The previous results can be qualitatively compared, for example, with the experimental results obtained by Nadaoka et al [25]_CITE"
In the present contribution the experiments on cnoidal breaking waves of Hansen and Svendsen [36]_CITE (see Fig_8) were used as a benchmark
"Azevedo_et al._(2011)_CITE brings a discussion about influence of extends association in use cases, which helps to count UCP more precisely"
"The TCF can be calculated according to the following formula ( Robiolo_et al.,_2009_CITE): (9)TCF=0.6+(0.01 T13T1WFc SIa)."
"See Connell_(2001),_Bryant_and_Darwin_(2004),_Phahlamohlaka_and_Friend_(2004)_and_S rensen_et_al._(2004)_CITE for examples."
"Champion_and_Wilson_(2010)_CITE provide a particularly useful set of contextual variables to be considered, based on a literature review and feedback from practitioners: organisational structure; influence of the external environment; length of history of the problem in focus; politics and personalities; perceived implementation difficulty; and the level of experience of stakeholders."
"We suggest that the following guidelines, derived from reflections on different systems paradigms (as represented by Jackson_(1991)_CITE, and others), can all contribute in different ways to boundary critique (the exploration of different possible boundaries, or frames, for a contextual analysis): Underpinning different boundary judgements may be quite different perspectives on the nature of the context (Churchman, 1970)"
"We note that our questions align well with five high level criteria suggested by Hjorts _(2004)_CITE for the evaluation of PSMs, except that our questions go into much more detail"
"We agree with Rowe_et_al._(2005)_CITE that assessing usability has to be a first priority, although validity and reliability should not be ignored"
"According to the most commonly accepted definition, Big Data is characterized by the 4 Vs [3]_CITE: volume, velocity, variety, and veracity"
CEPSim extends CloudSim [12]_CITE using a query model based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and introduces a simulation algorithm based on a novel abstraction called event sets
"This article significantly extends the authors previous work [15]_CITE by improving the discussion about CEPSim goals and assumptions, by introducing the event set concept, by presenting detailed descriptions of all simulation algorithms and a thorough evaluation of CEPSim"
"The basis of Complex Event Processing (CEP) was established by the work of Luckham on Rapide [10]_CITE, a distributed system simulator"
"Later on, the concepts were generalized and applied to the enterprise context in another study by Luckham [16]_CITE"
"At about the same time, the database community developed the first classical Stream Processing (SP) systems such as Aurora [17]_CITE and STREAM [18]_CITE"
The Continuous Query Language (CQL) [21]_CITE is the most prominent representative of this category.
The Aurora Stream Query Algebra (SQuAl) [17]_CITE inspired most languages in this category.
"Finally, the iCanCloud simulator [14]_CITE is similar to CloudSim, but it can also parallelize simulations and has a GUI to interact with the simulator"
"The queries used in the experiments in this section have been extracted from Powersmiths WOW system [41]_CITE, a sustainability management platform that draws on live measurements of buildings to support energy management"
Powersmiths WOW uses Apache Storm [31]_CITE to process in near real-time sensor readings coming from buildings managed by the platform.
"Apache Storm is an open-source distributed stream processing system that has been adopted by many enterprises, despite limitations regarding QoS maintenance, privacy, and security [42]_CITE"
"This validation approach is similar to the ones adopted by other simulators, such as NetworkCloudSim [9]_CITE, iCanCloud [14]_CITE, and Grozev and Buyya [35]_CITE."
An area-level linear mixed model with random area effects was first proposed by Fay_and_Herriot_(1979)_CITE to estimate average per-capita income in small places of the US
"In this setup, the introduced multivariate models contain the models proposed by Esteban_et al._(2011)_CITE as particular cases."
Their proof contains the general longitudinal model considered by Datta_and_Lahiri_(2000)_CITE as a special case
"By applying Lemmas 2 and A.3 of Prasad_and_Rao_(1990)_CITE, we finally obtain (F(i)+L(i))VAiVAjV(F(j)+L(j)) =O(D 2)DR DR and E[( i i)( j j)s(i)s(j) ]=cov( i, j)L(i)VL(j) +o(D 1)DR DR."
"Similarly as Prasad_and_Rao_(1990)_CITE , Datta_and_Lahiri_(2000)_CITE and Das_et al._(2004)_CITE , we estimate MSE( E) with (15)mse( E)=G1( )+G2( )+2G3( )"
This section compares the 2006 province poverty estimates of Esteban_et al._(2012)_CITE with the corresponding ones obtained in Applications 1 and 2 (appearing in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 respectively) and with the direct estimates
Datta_et al._(2002)_CITE also recommended the use of univariate methods because they are more simple to implement
"By applying Lemma A.2 of Prasad_and_Rao_(1990)_CITE, we have E=E[s1s2(q1 E[q1])(q2 E[q2])]= 1 E[v(v A1vv A2v)v ] 2 E[q1] 1 E[v(v A2v)v ] 2 E[q2] 1 E[v(v A1v)v ] 2+E[q1]E[q2] 1 V 2"
"By applying Lemma A.1(c) of Prasad_and_Rao_(1990)_CITE, we have E[v(v A1vv A2v)v ]=tr(A1V)tr(A2V)V+2tr(A1V)VA2V+2tr(A2V)VA1V+2tr(A1VA2V)V+4VA1VA2V+4VA2VA1V"
"By applying Lemma A.1(a) of Prasad_and_Rao_(1990)_CITE, we have E[v(v Aiv)v ]=tr(AiV)V+2VAiV,i=1,2"
"The definition of discourse used here is inspired by Habermas, who states that competing claims about truth, rightness and authenticity can be clarified by relying on the power of the best argument [7]_CITE"
"In fact, concern with the ethical aspects of computing coincides with the beginnings of digital computing and was famously expressed by Norbert Wiener [15]_CITE."
"One can observe numerous references to philosophical ethics, most notably the big three of (Kantian) deontology [16,17]_CITE, utilitarian consequentialism [18]_CITE and virtue ethics in the Aristotelian tradition [19]_CITE"
"Additionally, there are numerous other ethical approaches that are invoked in the area of computing, such as the ethics of care [21]_CITE, which may be useful for understanding particular aspects, such as the ethical side of gender issues in computing [22]_CITE, or the ethics underlying the capability approach developed by Sen [23]_CITE and Nussbaum [24]_CITE, which has been shown to be relevant to ethics-related research on ICT [25]_CITE, [26]_CITE."
"Within the Dutch philosophy of (information) technology there have also been interesting new developments focusing on the link between ethics and design, such as value sensitive design [29]_CITE, the morality of artefacts [30]_CITE, and thinking about responsible innovation, which has contributed to the development of RRI in general [31]_CITE."
"On the more technical side, there are theoretical positions stemming from areas such as engineering ethics [32]_CITE or technology ethics more broadly [33,34]_CITE that are relevant to computing"
"An interesting recent example of this is the Onlife Manifesto [42]_CITE, in which a number of leading scholars explore the ways in which computing technologies fundamentally change the world we live in and the way we relate to it."
"While the discourse on privacy can be traced back to Warren and Brandeis seminal paper [46]_CITE, the current relevance to computer ethics is that the availability of digital information and the possibility of storing, processing and disseminating it changes the nature of how we perceive privacy [47]_CITE"
The widely used and arguably highly misleading metaphor of piracy to denote intellectual property infringements [54 57]_CITE is an indication of the visceral quality of the debate.
"The seminal discussion of ethics in Information Systems by Mason in 1986 [77]_CITE, which coined the oft-cited acronym PAPA, touched on several of the aforementioned topics of computer ethics, namely, privacy, accuracy, property and access"
"The term responsible development , which is one of the roots of RRI, first appeared in the 21st century nano-technology research and development act (Public Law 108-153 [2]_CITE) in the US, where the concept is promoted as part of an initiative to strengthen nano-technological research."
A widely quoted definition of RRI from Von Schomberg [104]_CITE follows:
"We will also introduce the research context, research hypotheses, the used retrospective method ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE) and the experiment design including the treatments, response variables, and controlling the undesired variation"
"They are commonly defined as reflective practices ( Babb_et_al.,_2014_CITE), powerful tools for project teams to collectively identify communication gaps and practices to improve future projects ( Bjarnason_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"In software project retrospectives, CEDs are the most frequently used techniques ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"The detailed qualitative analysis of the causes is published in another paper ( Vanhanen_and_Lehtinen,_2014_CITE)"
Our method follows the postmortem analysis method introduced by Bj rnson_et_al._(2009)_CITE who claimed that such a retrospective method is lightweight and feasible for small software project teams
"Our hypotheses are also in line with the prior study about the cognitive maps ( Lee_et_al.,_1992_CITE)"
This section discusses the validity of our results using a validation scheme presented by Runeson_and_H st_(2008)_CITE
"Previously, we have qualitatively analyzed the causes which were detected in this study ( Vanhanen_and_Lehtinen,_2014_CITE) and we did not note any differences in the detected causes between the treatments"
We should continue the work of Bj rnsson_et_al._(2009)_CITE as one of the major challenges in the RCA of retrospectives is the high number of causes of problems
The reliability index is one of the widely accepted indicators to measure safety of engineering structures subject to uncertainties [12]_CITE
"Despite extensive research, such as the well known three stages of World Wide Failure Exercises [18 20]_CITE, a complete and validated methodology for predicting the behaviour of composite structures including the effects of damage has not yet been fully achieved"
First we will summarize the basic assumptions and the final formulae of the probabilistic homogenization method for the estimation of effective elastic moduli developed by the authors in [42]_CITE
"Among these methods, the Tsai Wu failure criterion [17]_CITE is the most frequently used because it takes into account the interactions between different stress components and provides a relatively accurate prediction of failure compared with other theories [22]_CITE"
"In this example, we study a single layer laminate that is made of carbon fibres embedded in an epoxy matrix with material properties indicated in [62]_CITE and listed in Table 1"

"A well-known example is AHEAD ( Batory_et al.,_2004_CITE), in which a product is incrementally built using a base module and a sequence of feature modules"
"It already contains software architectures, but a more detailed and powerful architecture description language (ADL), and the benefits of delta modeling for architectural evolution can be found in Haber_et al._(2012)_CITE."
"Vogel-Heuser_(2014e)_CITE gives an overview of several usability experiments introducing UML and SysML into aPS and concludes that pure UML is not appropriate, but a domain specific UML (plcUML, Witsch_and_Vogel-Heuser,_2011_CITE) with reduced number of diagrams, a supporting modeling process and integration in an IEC 61131-environment to support roundtrip engineering is more appropriate"
"The general area of round-trip engineering is well-researched ( Hettel_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"With the core idea of [31]_CITE, the following Lemma 2 has been obtained for the purpose of getting a desired finite set of preview controllers"
A Bayesian network (BN) is a graphical probabilistic model that is especially well-suited in decision-making scenarios that require us to consider multiple pieces of uncertain evidence involving causal relationships [6]_CITE
"To be an effective practical addition to the design process, computational simulation time must be shortened and reduced order modelling has been shown to be an effective method for attaining this goal [2,3]_CITE."
"Projection techniques of this nature have been successfully applied to a number of applications, from turbomachinery [13,14]_CITE to complete aircraft configurations [15]_CITE"
"The JST scheme [27]_CITE is applied for stabilization, more details on the solver can be found in [26]_CITE"
"These approaches can affect the order and timing of packet departures from a queue in a switch or NF, however we suggest a promising alternative direction that is inline with Amazon attempts to integrate custom schedulers in their cloud services ( Amazon,_2016_CITE)."
"We implemented SCC on top of the FastClick NFV framework ( Barbette_et al.,_2015_CITE)"
"Our testbed consists of two identical machines, each with a dual socket 16-core Intel Xeon CPU E5-2667 v3 clocked at 3.20 GHz ( Intel,_2016e_CITE)"
"The machines are directly interconnected using a dual-port 10 GbE Intel 82599 ES NIC; one machine uses MoonGen ( Emmerich_et al.,_2015_CITE) to generate and sink traffic, while in the second machine we deploy our NFV service chains and tools"
"We use ( Perf,_2016_CITE) to access the performance counters of the Linux kernel"
"As shown in Table 2 , using our custom OS benchmarks (available at ( Katsikas,_2016c_CITE)), we found that the context switching time between two processes scheduled using the default Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) ( Pabla,_2009_CITE) (with the default priority) is roughly 1000 ns, while this time is 940 and 1140 ns when using the real-time First In, First Out (FIFO) & round-robin (RR) and batch scheduling policies respectively"
"Moreover, our processor takes advantage of Intel Direct Data I/O ( Intel,_2016a_CITE) (DDIO) technology, allowing the Ethernet controller to use a portion of the processor last-level cache (LLC) as a primary source and destination of data rather than the main memory, thus achieving lower latency"
Details about how DDIO works in our testbed are given in Section 6.2.1.2 in Katsikas_(2016b_CITE).
"The SCC Profiler uses lmbench ( McVoy_and_Staelin,_1996_CITE) to measure the latencies of all the components of the underlying system memory hierarchy"
The complete list of available events is available at Intel_(2016b_CITE) and a detailed explanation of how these counters are collected and combined is provided in the Appendix A.1 in Katsikas_(2016b_CITE)
"We implemented an NF using the fastest Click ( Kohler_et al.,_2000_CITE) variant to date, called FastClick ( Barbette_et al.,_2015_CITE)"
"Finally, although we target NFV applications that use the native Linux driver for I/O, we also deployed the same router using FastClick DPDK ( DPDK,_2016_CITE) I/O elements (using the DPDK network driver) to examine the highest achievable performance"
The results shown in Table 4 were interpreted in detail in Section 6.3.1.1 of the licentiate thesis by Katsikas_(2016b_CITE)
"Although there are relevant available tools such as ( Sigoure,_2010_CITE), we developed our own benchmarks to acquire these metrics"
These benchmarks are available at Katsikas_(2016c_CITE).
"Moreover, likwid ( likwid,_2016_CITE) provides a broader performance monitoring suite"
"Given that there is already an extensive literature on disaster management that can be applied to solve this problem (see Paul_and_MacDonald,_2016_CITE, for an example of state of the art techniques), we do not consider the preparation stage in our model"
"A comprehensive up to date review of the multiple consequences of the Fukushima disaster ( Ahn_et al.,_2015_CITE) advocates that scientific and academic communities should start efforts for establishing the scientific bases, both natural and social, for better societal resilience."
"The DSS that is most relevant to the present study is COCO-2 ( Higgins_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"To accounting for these multiple factors in the context of nuclear emergencies, the so-called Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodology has been applied successfully ( French,_1996;_H m l inen_et al.,_2000_CITE)"
"These issues are clearly beyond the scope of the present study, and we direct the reader to ( Anderson,_Martin,_Valenzuela_et al.,_2006_CITE) for more information on the effect of agricultural subsidies on welfare"
