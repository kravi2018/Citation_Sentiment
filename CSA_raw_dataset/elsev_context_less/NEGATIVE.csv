"Unlike more conventional optimization approaches ( ie, single-objective, sequential-objectives or other MO techniques) [7]_CITE, GP offers an adjustable model to real network operation conditions, combining, on the one hand, simplicity of formulation expressing constrains usually as linear/non-linear programming, and, on the other hand, flexibility to compute the optimal solution thanks to simultaneously optimizing the deviations (underachieve/overachieve) of estimations (called goals) about real (domain-driven applications) conditions"
"However, unlike the study carried out by Di Marco et al, authors in [22]_CITE did not report results referred to the computational burden required by the analytical model resolution, especially, in the case in which the number of nodes is big"
"For instance, one case ( Cloke,_2007_CITE) was included, as there were indications of large-scale considerations, although the size remained unclear"
"If there were no indications of size, the paper was excluded, eg ( Miller_and_Haddad,_2012_CITE)."
"To complicate matters, some papers talked about the team in singular when referring to the organization ( Hodgkins_and_Hohmann,_2007_CITE), making it nontrivial to judge whether the organization met the large scale criteria based on the choice of words of the author."
"Further examples on exclusion by the large scale facet were cases with large organizations but only a single team adopting agile ( Fulgham_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Also piloting cases that reported only single teams using agile, even though considering the whole organization would meet the large scale criteria, were excluded, eg ( Scott_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"However, during our initial attempts to apply the PDF estimation method of Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE (hereafter BP11), we discovered that its computational performance is not practicable"
"However, because the Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE method involves a transformation from data-space to Fourier-space (ie, calculation of the empirical characteristic function), the method is quite slow if the empirical characteristic function is calculated using a direct Fourier transform"
"While Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE suggest that their method readily extends to multiple dimensions, special care will be required to develop multidimensional frequency filters (ie, In in Section 2.3), since neither the filter used in this paper nor the filter used by Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE has simple multidimensional analogs."
"Although this leads to a precise operation log ( Mens,_2002_CITE), there are several drawbacks"
"As reported in Brosch_et_al._(2010)_CITE, Herrmannsdoerfer_et_al._(2009)_CITE, Koegel_et_al._(2010)_CITE and Mens_(2008)_CITE, working only on this level does not scale."
"Our method is both more accurate than traditional survey methods [35,59]_CITE in measuring opinion leadership, and more comprehensive than network structure methods [41,43]_CITE"
"However, according to some empirical ( Flores,_Olson,_&_Pearce,_1993_CITE) and analytical research ( Hosoda_&_Disney,_2009_CITE), the most accurate forecasting does not always result in an optimal supply chain when local bullwhip or global inventory costs are taken into account ( Disney,_Lambrecht,_Towill,_&_Van_de_Velde,_2008;_Gaalman,_2006;_Gaalman_&_Disney,_2006;_Gaalman_&_Disney,_2009_CITE)."
"Though some results have been derived in [34]_CITE, they only cover a very weak form of stability, which states that the solutions of (2) with perturbed data stay close to the solution with unperturbed data, if one additionally increases the regularization parameter in the perturbed problem by a sufficient amount."
"Similar, but weaker, results have been already been derived in [5,28,61]_CITE in the context of Tikhonov regularization"
"In line with recent research showing that there are no gender differences regarding perception and decision about technology adoption within younger subjects [44]_CITE, we did not find significant impact."
"Traditionally, persistent data is still stored using hard disk drives (HDD) [21]_CITE with all the disadvantages which they have, such as boundaries on their access times, a lifetime limited by mechanical (moving) parts, and DRAM (volatile memory) with faster access"
"For brevity, the present paper does not discuss these once-mentioned limitations in the evaluation of the experiment presented in Jiang_et_al._(2009)_CITE."
"Indeed, there is no innovation ( Jackson,_2012_CITE, n.p.)"
"Previous research ( McCay-Peet_et_al.,_2014_CITE) had been unable to deduce whether the Highlights Trigger and Trigger-Rich facets were confounded or simply correlated"
"Enables Exploration, a proposed facet of the serendipitous digital environment ( McCay-Peet_et_al.,_2014_CITE) did not emerge as a distinct factor"
"We discovered that the natural language output version was more satisfying to climate scientists than version A and that they executed tasks up to twice as fast on the natural language output SUI (Gibbs,_2013)_CITE"
"Existing approaches for enforcement of Android security policies are either hard-coded interfaces with a limited set of enforcement options ( Beresford_et al.,_2011;_Zhou_et al.,_2011_CITE), or flexible and fine-grain approaches using a security policy specification language focusing on low level actions (eg API invocations or system calls) ( Rasthofer_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"In contrast to the refinement rules proposed in Neisse_and_Doerr_CITE (2013), our extension considers also the modification of events in addition to only allowing or denying the execution of activities"
A very similar approach with slightly less control on private information is introduced by Beresford_et al._(2011)_CITE in their solution named MockDroid
"More similar to our approach Cotterell_et al._(2015)_CITE introduce a solution to enable users to install policies for controlling sensitive data; however, the policies are not based on access to sensitive resources"
"Empirical studies showed that, by integrating the advantages of different EAs into one framework, PAP not only provides practitioners a unified approach for solving his/her problem set, but also may lead to better performance than a single EA [17]_CITE."
"In addition, some benchmarking studies have been undertaken to empirically compare the performance of these various techniques (eg, Baesens_et_al.,_2003_CITE), but they did not focus specifically on how these techniques compare on heavily imbalanced samples, or to what extent any such comparison is affected by the issue of class imbalance"
"First, unlike the method in [11]_CITE that focuses on particular affine regions, our method considers all pixels to have the same importance"
"Second, image invariants are not explicitly handled as in [11,15,16]_CITE, although the symmetry of the connectivity index together with the multiscale approach used allows the quantification of such invariants and simplify the analysis where such invariants are not relevant, for example, if there is no significant variation or when objects at different scales or rotated should actually be considered as different instances"
"A third difference to other methods such as those in [8,14,17]_CITE is that despite the importance of pixel-level descriptions, our approach does not use directly the grey values of the pixels or basic relations between neighbour pixels"
In KTH-TIPS2b the classification performance was also better than that reported in [16]_CITE (76%) using a similar database and protocol.
a more generalized Modal-LID3 algorithm (compared to [33]_CITE) to account for non-linear output functions;
"In general, problem-oriented research is rather underrepresented in literature ( Lam_et al.,_2012;_McKenna_et al.,_2015,_2016;_Pirker_and_Nusser,_2016;_Sedlmair_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"However, none of these approaches covered the full set of requirements as specified by Wagner_et al._(2014)_CITE during their problem characterization and abstraction"
"Concerning the characteristics of spatial language, Hubona et al [21]_CITE provide support for the cognitive fit theory in terms of decision accuracy but not in terms of time"
"Therefore, the consideration of fuzziness is superior to that of Chen [7]_CITE"
"This fact implies that it is not necessary to use a partitioning tool, such as METIS [14]_CITE, to carry out a deep analysis of the matrix to determine the subdomain partition"
"To the best of our knowledge, Theodoros et al [13]_CITE discuss the only team composition approach that specifically focuses on the expert network for determining the most suitable team"
"No model is available which is valid for a wider range of flow situations [7,8]_CITE"
It can be concluded that the zero parameter model by Angelidou et al [25]_CITE predicts a reasonable but not perfect distribution of enstrophy.
The algorithm was proved to be very competitive and outperformed our energy-based method and the method proposed by del_Solar_and_Verschae_(2004)_CITE
"With local search algorithms ( Arcuri,_2009_CITE) one only considers the neighborhood of a candidate solution"
"Harman_and_McMinn_(2010)_CITE recently determined that global search is more effective than local search, but less efficient, as it is more costly"
"This may seem in slight contrast to the results of our initial experiments in Fraser_et al._(2013)_CITE, where the best result was achieved with seeding, small population size (5), low rate of local search (every 75 generations), and a small budget (5) for local search"
"At any rate, one problem with parameter tuning is that, given a large set of experiments from which we choose the best configuration, such a configuration could be too specific for the employed case study ( Arcuri_and_Fraser,_2013_CITE)"
"In contrast, the Carfast ( Park_et al.,_2012_CITE) case study is devoid of such environmental dependencies, but still consists of a set of automatically generated software projects that are intended to be realistic"
"Alternatively, such techniques utilise automated conversational agents ( Huber_et al.,_2009_CITE), which do not scale and are not very effective due to the challenges of imitating human conversational behaviour"
"Solutions to detect such sophisticated attacks are emerging ( Aggarwal_et al.,_2014_CITE), but still fall short of successfully detecting against sophisticated text-based attacks."
The performance of our estimated model is reasonable in the sense that it is able to correctly estimate rhythmic motion unlike silhouette-based estimation as reported by Rosenhahn et al [2]_CITE: lack of information to correctly estimate the silhouette of the object
Other existing approaches that generate the configurations at runtime [15 20]_CITE also have limitations in mobile environments as usually most of them demand high computing resources
"Finally, the average adaptation time of our approach is considerably lower than the reported in [19]_CITE."
"On the other hand, the proposal of Benavides et al [38]_CITE always finds the optimal configuration using Constraint Satisfaction Problems with exponential-time complexity, making it unsuitable for runtime optimization."
"In max plus (tropical) convexity, such interpretation also involves the notion of tropical cellular decomposition [6]_CITE, whose max min analogue is still unknown"
"While it is possible to embed the detection of sensor noise in low-level networks ( Parisi_et_al.,_2015_CITE), it is non-trivial to detect inaccurate samples that belong to the feature space, eg caused by the (self-)occlusion of body joints"
"Although this approach yields the reliable recognition of a set of action words ( Twiefel_et_al.,_2014_CITE), it has the disadvantage that a specific set of words has to be defined a priori"
"These aspects have indeed been neglected by prior computational models of mental rotation (eg, Inui_&_Ashizawa,_2011;_Sasama_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Although cognitive robotics models of mental simulation have been recently proposed ( Di_Nuovo,_De_La_Cruz,_&_Marocco,_2013_CITE), these do not directly address mental rotation capabilities, but rather mental simulation for motor planning tasks"
"They also do not propose hypotheses on the brain mechanisms that may underlie them (eg, Di_Nuovo,_Marocco,_Cangelosi,_De_La_Cruz,_&_Di_Nuovo,_2012_CITE)"
"The architecture we proposed and its functioning mechanisms represent a further step with respect to previous computational models (eg, Inui_&_Ashizawa,_2011_CITE; Sasama_et al.,_2009_CITE) as these focused on mental rotation mechanisms without relating them to the other supporting processes such as matching processes and decision making processes ( Lamm_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
"The architecture also represents an innovation with respect to previous neuro-robotic models ( Seepanomwan_et al.,_2013a,_2013b_CITE) that did not distinguish between the brain areas possibly performing visual and proprioceptive processes and also used abstract monitoring and decision making mechanisms."
"A second innovation of the model in comparison to other neuro-robotic models ( Seepanomwan_et al.,_2013a,_2013b_CITE), shared with other neural-network models (eg, Sasama_et al.,_2009_CITE), involves a more general rotation process capable of rotating different, possibly novel objects (to the condition that these are represented in terms of edges)"
"Mechanisms as simple and general as these might be used to inspire other planning strategies to solve manipulation problems involving a low number of actions, eg not only rotations ( Ciancio,_Zollo,_Baldassarre,_Caligiore,_&_Guglielmelli,_2013;_Meola_et al.,_in press_CITE) but also linear translations in open space and 3D mental rotations."
"Nevertheless, there has been some lack of clarity in the risk field regarding what this concept means; compare, for example, Reinert_and_Apostolakis_(2006),_Park,_Amarchinta,_and_Grandhi_(2010),_Droguett_and_Mosleh_(2013,_2014_CITE) and Aven_and_Zio_(2013)_CITE"
"Few policies for risk management have created more controversy than the precautionary principle, and it is still being discussed; see for example Aven_(2011b),_Cox_(2011),_Lofstedt_(2003),_Sunstein_(2005),_Peterson_(2006),_Renn_(2008)_CITE) and Aldred_(2013)_CITE"
"However, even with the most expensive commercial mocap systems, there are still instances where noise and missing data are inevitable [1,3,18,21]_CITE"
"Meanwhile, the prevalence of some novel yet cheap mocap sensors (eg, Microsoft Kinect), which are able to capture human motion in real-time but whose outputs are not very accurate especially when significant occlusions occur, makes the mocap data refinement problem much more pertinent and important [13,45,48,54,60]_CITE."
"The data-driven methods often suffer from the out-of-sample problem [4,5,37]_CITE"
"However, they are off-line methods and only efficient for handling missing values for a very short period of time, typically less than 0.5 [1]_CITE"
"The method [31]_CITE, however, has to rely on the existence of other markers on the same segment to make inter-marker distance measurement possible [4]_CITE."
"Compared with [23]_CITE, our model does not only take the low-rank structure property into account but also the temporal stability property of motion data and noise effect"
Another significant difference between our model and its counterpart in [23]_CITE is that we do not need to guess the standard deviation of the noise which is used for solving the de-noising model in [23]_CITE
"In Section 4, we also have observed that our method is not only faster than the work [23]_CITE but also outperforms it in the experiments on both synthetic and real data"
SVT [23]_CITE only exploits the low-rank structure of motion data and cannot handle the cases where markers are missing for a long period of time
"From the last two columns of each sub-image in Fig_11, the shortcoming of SVT [23]_CITE is shown that it is unable to correctly predict some missing values"
"However, when some markers are missing for a long period of time, Dynammo [30]_CITE also fails to correctly predict the missing values"
"More importantly, our method is faster than Dynammo [30]_CITE and SVT [23]_CITE most of the time as shown in Fig_13"
"Therefore in Fig_9(k) and (f), SVT [30]_CITE is unable to correctly refine such a large-scale motion data, as opposed to our method, as shown in Fig_9(k) and (f), which demonstrates the robustness of our method."
"Our network has a maximum delivery capacity of 351 mega standard cubic meters, while the largest daily delivery from NCS in 2011 was 361 mega standard cubic meters (Gassco,_2011)_CITE"
"Indeed, we provide clear evidence that online forums afford users a way of being genuinely together, together , as opposed to what Turkle_(2012)_CITE calls alone together"
"Unlike the translation algorithm described in Sirin et al [27]_CITE which translates only the preconditions of atomic processes into the preconditions of SHOP2 operators, Translate-Atomic-Process( Q) translates both the preconditions and inputs of atomic processes into the preconditions of SHOP2 operators"
"Similarly, unlike the translation algorithm described in Sirin et al [27]_CITE which translates only the effects of atomic processes into the post-conditions of SHOP2 operators, Translate-Atomic-Process( Q) translates both the effects and outputs of atomic processes into the post-conditions of SHOP2 operators"
"Unlike the proposed approach described above, the approach by Sirin et al [27]_CITE does not combine operators to form a method"
SHOP2 does not support concurrency [27]_CITE and hence it cannot create parallel workflows
However Musman_et al._(2011)_CITE fails to get across any mathematical approaches or formal definitions for impact assessment.
"For example, Goodall_et al._(2009)_CITE focus on modeling and available data integration using ontologies but do not address an impact assessment"
"However, presented probability theory in Chung_et al._(2013)_CITE is not sound and voids fundamental principles of probabilistic inference in multiply connected graphs"
"Other impact propagation approaches, eg, by Kheir_et al._(2009)_CITE or Jahnke_et al._(2007)_CITE, claiming to handle details such as disagreeing information sources and cycles, are not probabilistic based and degrade to a handcrafted propagation algorithm with arbitrary scores, where parameters are only assessable by deeply trained experts and obtained results can only be used in a holistic way, as they provide no directly interpretable meaning"
"This is a general advantage of computationally formulated models, but is especially useful for spatial memory models, since experiments investigating spatial cognition using the classical, iterative cycle of hypothesis formulation, prediction derivation and testing ( Godfrey-Smith,_2003_CITE) usually require multiple, sometimes large environments (especially for navigation-scale spatial memory), and are thus impractical and time consuming to perform in the real world"
"Unlike ( Burgess_et al.,_2000_CITE), this model includes full visual processing, not just distance measurements to boundaries"
"Models with high biological realism (SNNs, eg McNaughton_et al.,_1996_CITE; or Erdem_&_Hasselmo,_2012_CITE) usually have trouble handling highly complex real-world environments (due mainly to their high computational demands, but also to the observation that it is easier to model high-level cognitive tasks such as planning with simpler such as symbolic models)"
"Overall, our research advances Sun_and_Tse's_(2009_CITE) model of platform competition by emphasizing that multi-homing can manifest differently within a single group of actors in the market"
"Third, based on our empirical findings, we question the number-driven success metrics employed to evaluate mobile application ecosystems (eg, Gupta,_2012;_Reuters,_2012_CITE)"
"First, we have advanced the model of Sun_and_Tse_(2009)_CITE on the influence of multi-homing in platform competition in two-sided markets in order to capture the characteristics of mobile application ecosystems"
Forecast assessments based on scoring rules have been heavily criticised because different rules may provide different conclusions about the forecasting capability of football forecast models [4]_CITE
"Any thorough book or literature review on genre, such as Freedman_&_Medway_(1994)_and_Paltridge_(1997)_CITE will divulge an overall lack of consensus on an appropriate definition of genre because so many questions remain unanswered with regard to how genres are replaced, created, evolve, function, overlap and interact with each other, which rules and patterns constitute a genre and how these characteristics are perceived"
"For instance, WordNet::Similarity [99]_CITE and WS4J [121]_CITE were designed before the emergence of the intrinsic IC models described in section 2.1, thus, these libraries maintain in-memory tables with the concept frequency counts which are interrogated in order to compute the IC values required in a similarity evaluation step; however, their data structures does not provide any proper abstraction layer or software architecture to integrate new intrinsic IC models easily"
"For example, Zhou et al [134]_CITE define the root depth as 1, whilst the standard convention in graph theory is 0"
"In a recent work [57]_CITE, we find some contradictory results and difficulties in replicating previous methods and experiments reported in the literature"
"These reproducibility problems were confirmed in another subsequent work, such as [56]_CITE, whilst new contradictory results are reported in [58]_CITE"
"Finally, despite one of the main motivations of WNetSS being to provide a software implementation for the most recent methods, looking at tables 2 and 3, you can see that WNetSS [15]_CITE neither implements nor cites many recent similarity measures and IC models reported in the literature."
"However, the synchronization process itself is not implemented using balanced excitation and inhibition among IF cells as in Hopfield_and_Brody_(2001)_CITE, but is rather described at the level of phase dynamics"
"ASR based on cepstral coefficients, for example, requires an additional Dynamic Time Warping or Hidden Markov Modelling stage ( Rabiner_&_Juang,_1993_CITE)"
"Unlike the previous study [66]_CITE, we analyze a significantly wider range of obstacle factors, including not only the traditionally discussed technical challenges such as reliability and QoS, but also various other factors, including heterogeneity and scale, and inhomogeneous distribution of resources among users"
The requirement of independent deployment of components entailed by the definition by Szyperski_(2002)_CITE is currently not a core requirement for us (and neither is in many other component-oriented approaches)
"In the parallel case, although widely used, the PRAM [30]_CITE model is unrealistic because it assumes all processors work synchronously and that interprocessor communication is free"
"Our definition refines Genet's concept of compatibility [7]_CITE, allowing better (ie, smaller) approximations of reachable terms in some cases"
"For example, whereas [5]_CITE only mentions the application areas in passing, we now provide many more details in Sections 5 and 6"
"But the question of importance is what was known about repulsor (or repellor) in the Lorenz system and the dynamics of time-reversal Lorenz system before the works [12,61]_CITE were published? Note that in [2,3]_CITE there is no discussion of the following important questions for the consideration of the Lorenz system in the backward time or with non positive parameters: the existence of the extension of solutions, the existence of attractors, and the possibility of consideration of invariant sets in the backward time"
"Also an invariant algebraic surface in the Chen system with c=0 (see, eg, [18,59]_CITE) has not correspondence with the Lorenz system [2]_CITE."
"Unfortunately, such a relation is not computable ( Weiser,_1984_CITE)"
"We have tried several clustering and visualization tools to cluster the is-in-the-slice-of graph for comparison, but most of the tools (such as Gephi Bastian_et_al.,_2009_CITE) failed due to the large dataset"
"Other tools such as CCVisu ( Beyer,_2008_CITE) which were able to handle the large data set simply produced a blob as a visualization which was not at all useful"
"In the present paper, we avoid the use of some simplifications considered in [12]_CITE and propose an original methodology to deduce a family of models that take into account the pressure dependence of viscosity, by solving the problem defined by Eqs"
"However, the small data and non negativity of dh/dt assumptions in [17]_CITE are very far from conditions in the present situation"
"In this paper, a rigorous methodology to include piezoviscosity previously to the limit procedures to obtain a Reynolds model has been developed, overcoming a simplification hypothesis considered in [12]_CITE"
We are not able to determine whether these 13 articles are also reported in the study by Chen_et_al._(2012)_CITE; we suspect that at least some are.
"However, the demise of the scientific methodology may be somewhat exaggerated, as argued in the many ripostes to the article (eg Dyson_et_al.,_2008;_Granville,_2013_CITE)"
"This cautiousness assumption is absent from [73]_CITE, in which it is assumed (like in the AGM revision setting) that the inputs Ei underlie more information than what is explicitly represented, under the form of weak plausibility orders i, so that f(E1,E2)=A B where A (resp"
"Liberatore and Schaerf [73]_CITE also mention Information Monotonicity, albeit without the restriction to consistent inputs, thus getting trivialisation results."
"When parallel fusion is taken for granted (see for instance [24]_CITE), the result is often required to be a weighted average of original probabilities"
"First, the complexity in selecting constraint parameters, structuring elements, cost functions, etc., was quite high in [5,15]_CITE"
"Second, the initial regional minima was manually defined as highly related to the over segmentation issue in [14,15]_CITE, and thus the applicability to different microscopic image data, eg, other data of PCD, is uncertain"
"From Table 4, we can see that the average rate obtained by CDF-DRVC/GP-EM is higher than that obtained by HROIT/GP-EM [37 38]_CITE, with an improved average rate of 4.3%; the CDF-DRVC/GP-EM also yields a lower Std of 2.39%, compared with a Std of 3.50% obtained by HROIT/GP-EM in the ten-fold cross-validation"
"These challenges are not reported in the recent Systematic Literature Review (SLR) ( Laukkanen_et_al.,_2017_CITE), which systematically reviewed the existing literature to identity problems and solutions in adopting CD."
"Our previous work ( Chen,_2015_CITE) did not include any of the strategies reported in this paper"
"The flow physics for these is complex and transitional [13]_CITE, where RANS modeling will be highly unreliable"
"Our algorithm can compute the positively weighted straight skeleton of a monotone polygon in O(nlog n) time and O(n) space, which constitutes a significant improvement over the O(n17/11+ ) worst-case time and space complexity of the currently best algorithm for arbitrary simple polygons by Eppstein and Erickson [2]_CITE"
"(The algorithm by Vigneron and Yan [7]_CITE achieves an expected O(n4/3log n) time complexity but is only applicable if no multi-split events occur.) Furthermore, our algorithm does not require complex data structures and is easy to implement."
"Whereas, in the outer surf zone, the wave height is under-predicted by approximately 5% with respect to the one-dimensional model of Musumeci et al [22]_CITE"
"We can conclude that the UAW also has an effect on size estimation, which is different than the findings published previously in Ochodek_et al.,_(2011b)_CITE"
"Warburton_et_al._(2007)_CITE propose reflection on context, purposes and methods, but they do not consider the implications of the researcher role in the situation"
"Unlike the model introduced by Gonz lez-Manteiga_et al._(2008b)_CITE with a common random effect for all the components of the target variable, the new models have multivariate vectors of random effects with the same dimension as the target variable and allowing for different correlation structures"
Datta_et al._(2002)_CITE conclusions were thus restricted to their case of study
This definition is critically discussed in [105]_CITE
"Unfortunately, software project retrospectives are often neglected ( Dyb _et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"However, the effect for learning has been claimed to be valid only if the prior knowledge on the problem is low ( Mayer_and_Gallini,_1990_CITE)"
"Another problem of the fishbone diagram is a tree structure ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Furthermore, the retrospective outcome and the perceptions of participants utilizing a structural list have rarely been compared with the use of CED ( St lhane,_2004;_St lhane_et_al.,_2003_CITE)"
"We assumed that in the context of software engineering, using that technique makes the analysis difficult, because of the high number of detected causes ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"However, comparison between the fishbone diagram and the directed graph ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE) is not enough for determining the effectiveness of using the structural list, because the fishbone diagram utilizes different visual structure than the structural list."
"Instead, they have only considered the learning efficiency from a premade knowledge, eg, learning how the blood vessel is functioning ( Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003_CITE)."
"The prior studies have also failed to address the questions whether the use of CED outperforms textual notations formulated as a structural list ( Ammerman,_1998_CITE) during the RCA of retrospectives"
"However, as in Kumar_et al._(2009_CITE), only the software algorithms are applicable to ABCs because the hardware used was not described"
"As the approach in ( Walther_and_W rtz,_2009_CITE) their work is limited to movements in the 2D image plane"
"Thus in this setting, taking into account (62), it is possible to see that the hypotheses of Theorem 4.1 are satisfied, but the corresponding classical result, that is when F=Fcofin (see also [9,_Corollary_4]_CITE), does not hold."
"These theoretical results suggest that, contrary to Clark_and_Squire_(1998)_CITE, episodic memory may not be necessary to consciously experience emotions"
"However, the uniqueness theorem mentioned in [51]_CITE (Theorem 3.2, Chapter IV) cannot be applied directly to our model as ( i) it applies only for a one-dimensional process and ( ii) the coefficients b(x):R R and (x):R R of the SDE mentioned in this theorem are purely deterministic functions not time dependent stochastic functions"
We cannot use Theorem 2.4 in Chapter IV of [51]_CITE directly to do this as the solution does not satisfy condition (2.18) there
"The reason is that the Milstein method is strongly convergent with order 1 as the integration time-step goes to zero, which is better than the Euler Maruyama method which only has a convergence order of 0.5 [53]_CITE"
"Dyson treatment of this is relatively short, at just one 18-page chapter [1]_CITE"
LineSets were introduced to overcome problems associated with visual clutter that is seen in Euler diagrams [3]_CITE
"An early attempt to combine sets and networks in a single visualization relied on first drawing an Euler diagram then placing a graph inside it [30]_CITE, however the sets were often visualized with convoluted, difficult to follow curves"
Compound graphs can be used to represent restricted kinds of grouped network data [8]_CITE
"One found Bubble Sets outperformed LineSets [24]_CITE whereas another found that KelpFusion outperformed LineSets which, in turn, outperformed Bubble Sets [28]_CITE"
"In Kertzner_et al._(2006)_CITE, only a brief description of several risk assessment methodologies for the oil and gas sector is outlined"
"In some instances, a method is not demonstrated in full, only some activities within the method are dealt with in a case study (eg Roy_et al.,_2010_CITE) In three proposals ( Chittester_and_Haimes,_2004;_Permann_and_Rohde,_2005;_Yu_et al.,_2006_CITE) no discussion of a method evaluation was found"
"In Kriaa_et al._(2012)_CITE, the method is said to enable a coarse quantification of the attack success probability , but it is not validated whether the quantification suggested is accurate enough to back up security decisions."
"The proof is often limited to the statements like in McQueen_et al._(2006)_CITE saying that the formulas suggested have intuitive meaning for the analysts, testers, and control system users and are clear, reasonably intuitive, and sufficiently well-defined to guide the analysis of the proposed method"
"However, a repair schedule with the minimum length of time is not always the most efficient in supporting subsequent relief operations [21]_CITE, and more comprehensive criteria are required for properly evaluating solutions to the complex problem."
"Experiment shows the proposed method is superior to the basic EP, GA, and differential evolution (DE) [62]_CITE in convergence speed and solution accuracy."
"In the case of linear equations this method bears a close relationship to the method of separation of variables and, in fact, this method produces a large supply of separable solutions for linear equations and it is more algorithmic and more general than the classical Lie method [2 4]_CITE."
"Even though concepts such as social debt ( Tamburri et al,_2013_CITE) and people debt ( Alves et al,_2014_CITE) describe similar phenomena of having shortcuts and non-optimal solutions in software development and organization, we believe that they should be categorized as sources for TD rather than as actual TD"
"These papers, however, concentrate on specific subsystems of Large Scale Distributed Systems, such as [11]_CITE on the performance of memory systems, or only deal with one or two specific SLA parameters"
"Also the VCONF model by Rao et al [16]_CITE has similar goals as presented in Section 1, but depends on specific parameters, can only execute one action per iteration and it neglects the energy consumption of executed actions"
"Thirdly, commercial Cloud IaaS platforms such as Amazon EC2 [29]_CITE, Rackspace [30]_CITE or RightScale [31]_CITE have a very limited choice of preconfigured and static VM resource provisioning types"
"Current monitoring systems (eg, ganglia [35]_CITE) facilitate monitoring only of low-level systems resources, such as free_disk or packets_sent, but SLA parameters typically are, eg, storage and outgoing bandwidth"
"As opposed to the CBR approach in [7]_CITE, the rule-based approach is able to fire more than one action at the same iteration, which inherently increases the flexibility of the system"
"For example, Support Vector Machines (SVM) [33]_CITE, that are employed in many applicative domains [3,4,13,24]_CITE, really become intractable and computationally too expensive when huge data sets are handled [32]_CITE"
"However, other techniques are not feasible with very large data set because they work: (1) by modifying cost for misclassified patterns belonging to the minority class, without changing the number of original data [7]_CITE, (2) by increasing the total number of examples by copying patterns from the minority class to balance the ratio of classes ( oversampling method) [9]_CITE, (3) by combining oversampling and undersampling techniques [34]_CITE."
"However, with the approach of Hirsch_(2010_CITE) and Hirsch_et al._(2008_CITE), debugging of automation software directly inside the SysML model is not provided"
"Conventional robust preview control, which has been studied in [5 9]_CITE, is restricted to small ranges of variations"
"However, accurate unsteady simulations, involving a given geometry and a number of flow parameters [1]_CITE, often require so much cpu time to sweep the parameter space that they have limited impact on the design cycle"
Computing the POD mode coefficients requires the evaluation of integrals over the entire computational domain and this can be a computationally expensive task for large problems [2]_CITE
"Although a similar technique was successfully used by Qamar and Sanghi [19]_CITE, the approach does not appear to have been widely adopted as an alternative to projection techniques"
"This could be a significant issue in many practical problems, such as shape optimisation, where the number of parameters involved can be very large [20]_CITE"
"POD coefficient interpolation type techniques, as introduced by Ly and Tran [11]_CITE, have not been widely adopted as an alternative to projection type techniques"
"In contrast to Sivaraman_et al._(2016)_CITE; Mittal_et al._(2016)_CITE, our research findings show that a chain of NFs requires a global scheduler to make chain-level decisions, rather than an internal scheduler that executes local switch policies"
"These problems were discussed in earlier work ( Rizzo,_2012_CITE), but without much evidence; thus one of our contributions is proving this evidence."
"There is not enough information in Jacob_et al._(2009)_CITE, Lochard_and_Schneider_(1992)_CITE to estimate and"
