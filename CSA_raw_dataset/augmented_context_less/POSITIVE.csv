'1 Introduction The Maximum Entropy -LRB- ME -RRB- statistical framework <CIT> has been successfully deployed in several NLP tasks '
'To achieve efficient parsing , we use a beam search strategy like the previous methods <CIT> '
'Successflfl examples of reuse of data resources include : the WordNet thesaurus <OTH> ; the Penn Tree Bank <CIT> ; the Longmans Dictionary of Contemporary English <OTH> '
'Averaging has been shown to help reduce overfitting <CIT> '
'Hypergraphs have been successfully used in parsing <CIT> and machine translation <CIT> '
'1 Introduction <CIT> introduced minimum error rate training -LRB- MERT -RRB- for optimizing feature weights in statistical machine translation -LRB- SMT -RRB- models , and demonstrated that it produced higher translation quality scores than maximizing the conditional likelihood of a maximum entropy model using the same features '
'1 Introduction When data have distinct sub-structures , models exploiting latent variables are advantageous in learning <CIT> '
'<CIT> and <OTH> shows how some of the methods which have been used in the past -LRB- particularly mutual information scores -RRB- are invalid for rare events , and introduce accurate measures of how ` surprising '' rare events are '
'Nowadays , most of the state-of-the-art SMT systems are based on bilingual phrases <CIT> '
'In this paper , we show that a noisy channel model instantiated within the paradigm of Statistical Machine Translation -LRB- SMT -RRB- <CIT> can successfully provide editorial assistance for non-native writers '
'However , formally syntax-based methods propose simple but efficient ways to parse and translate sentences <CIT> '
'441 N-gram Co-Occurrence Statistics for Answer Extraction N-gram co-occurrence statistics have been successfully used in automatic evaluation <OTH> , and more recently as training criteria in statistical machine translation <CIT> '
'3 Experimental Results Whereas stochastic modelling is widely used in speech recognition , there are so far only a few research groups that apply stochastic modelling to language translation <CIT> '
'1 Introduction By exploiting information encoded in human-produced syntactic trees <CIT> , research on probabilistic models of syntax has driven the performance of syntactic parsers to about 90 % accuracy <OTH> '
'Unigram models have been previously shown to give good results in sentiment classification tasks <CIT> : unigram representations can capture a variety of lexical combinations and distributions , including those of emotion words '
'The state-of-the art taggers are using feature sets discribed in the corresponding articles -LRB- <OTH> , <OTH> , <OTH> and <CIT> -RRB- , Morce supervised and Morce semi-supervised are using feature set desribed in section 4 '
'It performed slightly worse on baseNP recognition than the <CIT> experiments -LRB- Fz = 1 = 916 -RRB- '
'21 The averaged perceptron The averaged perceptron algorithm <CIT> was proposed as a way of reducing overfitting on the training data '
'In the statistical NLP community , the most widely used grammatical resource is the Penn Treebank <CIT> '
'<OTH> , Pedersen <OTH> , Yarowsky and Florian <OTH> -RRB- as well as maximum entropy models -LRB- eg , Dang and Palmer <OTH> , <CIT> and Manning <OTH> -RRB- in particular have shown a large degree of success for WSD , and have established challenging state-of-the-art benchmarks '
'1 Introduction Large scale annotated corpora such as the Penn TreeBank <CIT> have played a central role in speech and natural language research '
'<CIT> report an improvement in MT grammaticality on a very restricted test set : short sentences parsable by an LFG grammar without back-off rules '
'We carried out automatic evaluation of our summaries using ROUGE <CIT> toolkit , which has been widely adopted by DUC for automatic summarization evaluation '
'In machine translation , confusion-network based combination techniques -LRB- eg , <CIT> -RRB- have achieved the state-of-theart performance in MT evaluations '
'However , except for <CIT> , none of these advances in alignment quality has improved translation quality of a state-of-the-art system '
'In this paper , we build on recent work <CIT> that demonstrated how the Bloom filter -LRB- Bloom -LRB- 1970 -RRB- ; BF -RRB- , a space-efficient randomised data structure for representing sets , could be used to store corpus statistics efficiently '
'Among all the automatic MT evaluation metrics , BLEU <CIT> is the most widely used '
'To simulate real world scenario , we use n-best lists from ISIs state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system , AlTemp <CIT> , and the 2002 NIST Chinese-English evaluation corpus as the test corpus '
'A quite different approach from our hypotheses testing implemented in the TREQ-AL aligner is taken by the model-estimating aligners , most of them relying on the IBM models -LRB- 1 to 5 -RRB- described in the <CIT> seminal paper '
'In our future work we plan to investigate the effect of more sophisticated and , probably , more accurate filtering methods <CIT> on the QA results '
'In Statistical Machine Translation -LRB- SMT -RRB- , recent work shows that WSD helps translation quality when the WSD system directly uses translation candidates as sense inventories <CIT> '
'Most semi-automated approaches have met with limited success <OTH> and supervised learning models have tended to outperform dictionary-based classi cation schemes <CIT> '
'While studies have shown that ratings of MT systems by BLEU and similar metrics correlate well with human judgments <CIT> , we are not aware of any studies that have shown that corpus-based evaluation metrics of NLG systems are correlated with human judgments ; correlation studies have been made of individual components <OTH> , but not of systems '
'While EM has worked quite well for a few tasks , notably machine translations -LRB- starting with the IBM models 1-5 <CIT> , it has not had success in most others , such as part-of-speech tagging <OTH> , named-entity recognition <OTH> and context-free-grammar induction -LRB- numerous attempts , too many to mention -RRB- '
'Incremental top-down and left-corner parsers have been shown to effectively -LRB- and efficiently -RRB- make use of non-local features from the left-context to yield very high accuracy syntactic parses <CIT> , and we will use such rich models to derive our scores '
'Erk <OTH> compared a number of techniques for creating similar-word sets and found that both the Jaccard coefficient and <CIT> s information-theoretic metric work best '
'4 Extended Minimum Error Rate Training Minimum error rate training <CIT> is widely used to optimize feature weights for a linear model <CIT> '
'When we run our classifiers on resource-tight environments such as cell-phones , we can use a random feature mixing technique <CIT> or a memory-efficient trie implementation based on a succinct data structure <OTH> to reduce required memory usage '
'32 Evaluation Criteria Well-established objective evaluation measures like the word error rate -LRB- WER -RRB- , positionindependent word error rate -LRB- PER -RRB- , and the BLEU score <CIT> were used to assess the translation quality '
'In recent several years , the system combination methods based on confusion networks developed rapidly <CIT> , which show state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks '
'Although bi-alignments are known to exhibit high precision <CIT> , in the face of sparse annotations we use unidirectional alignments as a fallback , as has been proposed in the context of phrase-based machine translation <CIT> '
'It is based on Incremental Sigmoid Belief Networks -LRB- ISBNs -RRB- , a class of directed graphical model for structure prediction problems recently proposed in <CIT> , where they were demonstrated to achieve competitive results on the constituent parsing task '
'In our experience , this approach is advantageous in terms of translation quality , eg by 07 % in BLEU compared to a minimum Bayes risk primary <CIT> '
'To solve this problem , we adopt an idea one sense per collocation which was introduced in word sense disambiguation research <CIT> '
'The results show that , as compared to BLEU , several recently proposed metrics such as Semantic-role overlap <OTH> , ParaEval-recall <OTH> , and METEOR <CIT> achieve higher correlation '
'Parsing models have been developed for different languages and state-of-the-art results have been reported for , eg , English <CIT> '
'For English , after a relatively big jump achieved by <CIT> , we have seen two significant improvements : <OTH> and <OTH> pushed the results by a significant amount each time1 1In our final comparison , we have also included the results of <OTH> , because it has surpassed <CIT> as well and we have used this tagger in the data preparation phase '
'However , evaluations on the widely used WSJ corpus of the Penn Treebank <CIT> show that the accuracy of these parsers still lags behind the state-of-theart '
'22 Maximum Entropy Models Maximum entropy -LRB- ME -RRB- models <CIT> , also known as 928 log-linear and exponential learning models , provide a general purpose machine learning technique for classification and prediction which has been successfully applied to natural language processing including part of speech tagging , named entity recognition etc Maximum entropy models can integrate features from many heterogeneous information sources for classification '
'1 Introduction Many state-of-the-art machine translation -LRB- MT -RRB- systems over the past few years <CIT> rely on several models to evaluate the goodness of a given candidate translation in the target language '
'The use of dependencies in MT evaluation has not been extensively researched before -LRB- one exception here would be <CIT> -RRB- , and requires more research to improve it , but the method shows potential to become an accurate evaluation metric '
'Albeit simple , the algorithm has proven to be very efficient and accurate for the task of parse selection <CIT> '
'It is an online training algorithm and has been successfully used in many NLP tasks , such as POS tagging <CIT> , parsing <CIT> , Chinese word segmentation <OTH> , and so on '
'We wish to minimize this error function , so we select accordingly : argmin summationdisplay a E -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- a , -LRB- argmax a p -LRB- a , f e -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -LRB- 4 -RRB- Maximizing performance for all of the weights at once is not computationally tractable , but <CIT> has described an efficient one-dimensional search for a similar problem '
'For French\/English translation we use a state of the art phrase-based MT system similar to <CIT> '
'In agreement with recent results on parsing with lexicalised probabilistic grammars <CIT> , our main result is that statistics over lexical features best correspond to independently established truman intuitive preferences and experimental findings '
'Since human evaluation is costly and difficult to do reliably , a major focus of research has been on automatic measures of MT quality , pioneered by BLEU <CIT> and NIST <OTH> '
'It is interesting to note that, while the study of how the granularity of context-free grammars (CFG) affects the performance of a parser (e.g. in the form 86 n1:IP [=] n2:NP [SUBJ=] n4:NR [=] GSC4ES JiangZemin n3:VP [=] n5:VV [=] ESDO interview n6:NP [OBJ=] n7:NR [ADJUNCT] AIC1 Thai n8:NN [=] D3D2 president f1             PRED ESDO SUBJ f2  PRED GSC4ESNTYPE proper NUM sg   OBJ f3       PRED D3D2 NTYPE common NUM sg ADJUNCT   f4  PRED AIC1NTYPE proper NUM sg                         : N  F (n1)=(n3)=(n5)=f1 (n2)=(n4)=f2 (n6)=(n8)=f3 (n7)=f4 Figure 1: Cand f-structures with  links for the sentence GSC4ESESDOAIC1D3D2 of grammar transforms (Johnson, 1998) and lexicalisation (Collins, 1997)) has attracted substantial attention, to our knowledge, there has been a lot less research on this subject for surface realisation, a process that is generally regarded as the reverse process of parsing.'
'The former term P -LRB- E -RRB- is called a language model , representing the likelihood of E The latter term P -LRB- J E -RRB- is called a translation model , representing the generation probability from E into J As an implementation of P -LRB- J E -RRB- , the word alignment based statistical translation <CIT> has been successfully applied to similar language pairs , such as FrenchEnglish and German English , but not to drastically dierent ones , such as JapaneseEnglish '
'The best previous result is an accuracy of 561 % <CIT> '
'1 Introduction Hierarchical approaches to machine translation have proven increasingly successful in recent years <CIT> , and often outperform phrase-based systems <OTH> on target-language fluency and adequacy '
'Throughout , the likelihood ratio <CIT> is used as significance measure because of its stable performance in various evaluations , yet many more measures are possible '
'However , the study of <CIT> provides interesting insights into what makes a good distributional similarity measure in the contexts of semantic similarity prediction and language modeling '
'While <CIT> does not discuss distinguishing more than 2 senses of a word , there is no immediate reason to doubt that the ` one sense per collocation '' rule <CIT> would still hold for a larger number of senses '
'Similarity-based smoothing <CIT> provides an intuitively appealing approach to language modeling '
'<CIT> , which is the classic work on collocation extraction , uses a two-stage filtering model in which , in the first step , n-gram statistics determine possible collocations and , in the second step , these candidates are submitted to a syntactic valida7Of course , lexical material is always at least partially dependent on the domain in question '
'One of the most effective taggers based on a pure HMM is that developed at Xerox <CIT> '
'The success of recent high-quality parsers <CIT> relies on the availability of such treebank corpora '
'Synchronous binarization <CIT> solves this problem by simultaneously binarizing both source and target-sides of a synchronous rule , making sure of contiguous spans on both sides whenever possible '
'<CIT> reported very high results -LRB- 96 % on the Brown corpus -RRB- for unsupervised POS tagging using Hidden Markov Models -LRB- HMMs -RRB- by exploiting hand-built tag dictionaries and equivalence classes '
'All the enumerated segment pairs are listed in the following table : Feature x , y Feature x , y AM1 +1 c1 , c0 AM2 +1 c2c1 , c0 AM1 +2 c1 , c0c1 AM2 +2 c2c1 , c0c1 AM1 +3 c1 , c0c1c2 AM3 +1 c3c2c1 , c0 We use Dunnings method <CIT> because it does not depend on the assumption of normality and it allows comparisons to be made between the signiflcance of the occurrences of both rare and common phenomenon '
'3 Extending Bleu and Ter with Flexible Matching Many widely used metrics like Bleu <CIT> and Ter <OTH> are based on measuring string level similarity between the reference translation and translation hypothesis , just like Meteor Most of them , however , depend on finding exact matches between the words in two strings '
'Promising features might include those over source side reordering rules <OTH> or source context features <CIT> '
'The BLEU metric <CIT> and the closely related NIST metric <OTH> along with WER and PER 48 have been widely used by many machine translation researchers '
'A later study <CIT> found that performance increased to 872 % when considering only those portions of the text deemed to be subjective '
'1 Introduction We have seen rapid recent progress in machine translation through the use of rich features and the development of improved decoding algorithms , often based on grammatical formalisms1 If we view MT as a machine learning problem , features and formalisms imply structural independence assumptions , which are in turn exploited by efficient inference algorithms , including decoders <CIT> '
'Although state-of-the-art statistical parsers <CIT> are more accurate , the simplicity and efficiency of deterministic parsers make them attractive in a number of situations requiring fast , light-weight parsing , or parsing of large amounts of data '
'<CIT> has been unable to find real examples of cases where hierarchical alignment would fail under these conditions , at least in fixed-word-order languages that are lightly inflected , such as English and Chinese -LRB- p 385 -RRB- '
'1 Introduction Phrase-based method <OTH> and syntaxbased method <CIT> represent the state-of-the-art technologies in statistical machine translation -LRB- SMT -RRB- '
'1 Introduction Phrase-based translation <CIT> and hierarchical phrase-based translation <OTH> are the state of the art in statistical machine translation -LRB- SMT -RRB- techniques '
'Although the Kappa coefficient has a number of advantages over percentage agreement -LRB- eg , it takes into account the expected chance interrater agreement ; see <CIT> for details -RRB- , we also report percentage agreement as it allows us to compare straightforwardly the human performance and the automatic methods described below , whose performance will also be reported in terms of percentage agreement '
'Recent innovations have greatly improved the efficiency of language model integration through multipass techniques , such as forest reranking <CIT> , local search <OTH> , and coarse-to-fine pruning <OTH> '
'However , since most of statistical translation models <CIT> are symmetrical , it is relatively easy to train a translation system to translate from English to Chinese , except that weneed to train aChinese language model from the Chinese monolingual data '
'In terms of applying non-parametric Bayesian approaches to NLP , <CIT> evaluated the clustering properties of DPMMs by performing anaphora resolution with good results '
'The full model yields a stateof-the-art BLEU <CIT> score of 08506 on Section 23 of the CCGbank , which is to our knowledge the best score reported to date 410 using a reversible , corpus-engineered grammar '
'They have been successfully applied in several tasks , such as information retrieval <OTH> and harvesting thesauri <CIT> '
'<CIT> showed that the results for French-English were competitive to state-of-the-art alignment systems '
'Another kind of popular approaches to dealing with query translation based on corpus-based techniques uses a parallel corpus containing aligned sentences whose translation pairs are corresponding to each other <CIT> '
'The corpus-based statistical parsing community has many fast and accurate automated parsing systems , including systems produced by <CIT> , Charniak -LRB- 1997 -RRB- and Ratnaparkhi -LRB- 1997 -RRB- '
'Head-lexicalized stochastic grammars have recently become increasingly popular <CIT> '
'Unsupervised algorit ~ m ~ such as <CIT> have reported good accuracy that rivals that of supervised algorithms '
'<CIT> is one of the most famous work that discussed learning polarity from corpus '
'This method , initially proposed by <CIT> , was successfully evaluated in the context of the SENSEVAL framework <OTH> '
'23 Classifier Training We chose maximum entropy <CIT> as our primary classifier because the highest performing systems in both the SemEval-2007 preposition sense disambiguation task <OTH> and the general word sense disambiguation task <OTH> used it '
'Each component model takes the exponential form: a37a55a38a57a56 a51 a42a6a44a59a58a60a56 a61 a51a64a63a65a53a67a66 a53 a45a46a70 a71a16a72a21a73a75a74a77a76a79a78a81a80 a78a16a82a11a78 a38a83a44a59a58a60a56a84a61 a51a64a63a65a53a67a66 a53 a58a60a56 a51 a45a86a85 a87 a38a83a44a59a58a60a56a84a61 a51a64a63a65a53a67a66 a53 a45 a58 (2) where a87 a38a83a44a59a58a60a56 a61 a51a41a63a65a53a67a66 a53 a45 is a normalization term to ensure that a37a55a38a57a56 a51a42a6a44a88a58a60a56a62a61 a51a41a63a65a53a67a66 a53 a45 is a probability, a82a11a78 a38a83a44a59a58a60a56 a61 a51a64a63a65a53a67a66 a53 a58a60a56 a51 a45 is a feature function (often binary) and a80 a78 is the weight ofa82a21a78 . Given a set of features and a corpus of training data, there exist ef cient training algorithms (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972; Berger et al. , 1996) to nd the optimal parameters a89 a80 a78a14a90 . The art of building a maximum entropy parser then reduces to choosing good features.'

'They provide pairs of phrases that are used to construct a large set of potential translations for each input sentence , along with feature values associated with each phrase pair that are used to select the best translation from this set1 The most widely used method for building phrase translation tables <CIT> selects , from a word alignment of a parallel bilingual training corpus , all pairs of phrases -LRB- up to a given length -RRB- that are consistent with the alignment '
'In the SMT research community , the second step has been well studied and many methods have been proposed to speed up the decoding process , such as node-based or span-based beam search with different pruning strategies <OTH> and cube pruning <CIT> '
'A promising approach may be to use aligned bilingual corpora , especially for augmenting existing lexicons with domain-specific terminology <CIT> '
'It was found to produce automated scores , which strongly correlate with human judgements about translation fluency <CIT> '
'1 Introduction The most widely used alignment model is IBM Model 4 <CIT> '
'We view this as a particularly promising aspect of our work , given that phrase-based systems such as Pharaoh <CIT> perform better with higher recall alignments '

'1 Introduction Automatic Metrics for machine translation -LRB- MT -RRB- evaluation have been receiving significant attention in the past two years , since IBM ''s BLEU metric was proposed and made available <CIT> '
'In the classic work on SMT , Brownandhiscolleagues atIBMintroduced the notion of alignment between a sentence f and its translation e and used it in the development of translation models <CIT> '
'<CIT> work is perhaps one of the most notable examples of unsupervised polarity classification '
'a2 Maximum-entropy method The maximum-entropy method is useful with sparse data conditions and has been used by many researchers <CIT> '
'NJ 08903 USA suzanne ~ ruccs , rutgers , edu Empirically-induced models that learn a linguistically meaningflll grammar <CIT> seem to give tile best practical results in statistical natural language processing '
'Freund and Schapire <OTH> originally proposed the averaged parameter method ; it was shown to give substantial improvements in accuracy for tagging tasks in <CIT> '
'Phrase-based decoding <CIT> is a dominant formalism in statistical machine translation '
'However , other types of nonlocal information have also been shown to be effective <CIT> and we will examine the effectiveness of other non-local information which can be embedded into label information '
'The translation quality was evaluated using a well-established automatic measure : BLEU score <CIT> '

'4 Evaluation The purpose of our evaluation is to contrast our proposed feature based approach with a state-ofthe-art sequential learning technique <CIT> '
'This combination of the perceptron algorithm with beam-search is similar to that described by <CIT> 5 The perceptron algorithm is a convenient choice because it converges quickly usually taking only a few iterations over the training set <CIT> '
'1 Motivation Phrase-based statistical machine translation <CIT> has emerged as the dominant paradigm in machine translation research '
'1 Introduction Treebank-based probabilistic parsing has been the subject of intensive research over the past few years , resulting in parsing models that achieve both broad coverage and high parsing accuracy <CIT> '
'The best examples of this approach has been the resent work of Yarowsky <CIT> , <CIT> , <CIT> '
'The IBM models 1-5 <CIT> produce word alignments with increasing algorithmic complexity and performance '
'Probably the most widely used feature weighting function is (point-wise) Mutual Information (MI) (Church and Patrick 1990; Hindle 1990; Luk 1995; Lin 1998; Gauch, Wang, and Rachakonda 1999; Dagan 2000; Baroni and Vegnaduzzo 2004; Chklovski and Pantel 2004; Pantel and Ravichandran 2004; Pantel, Ravichandran, and Hovy 2004; Weeds, Weir, and McCarthy 2004), dened by: weight MI (w,f)=log 2 P(w,f) P(w)P(f) (1) We calculate the MI weights by the following statistics in the space of co-occurrence instances S: weight MI (w,f)=log 2 count(w,f) nrels count(w) count(f) (2) where count(w,f) is the frequency of the co-occurrence pair w,f  in S, count(w)and count(f) are the independent frequencies of w and f in S,andnrels is the size of S.High MI weights are assumed to correspond to strong wordfeature associations.'
'Even robust parsers using linguistically sophisticated formalisms , such as TAG <OTH> , CCG <OTH> , HPSG <OTH> and LFG <CIT> , often use training data derived from the Penn Treebank '
'The NIST MT03 set is used to tune model weights -LRB- eg those of -LRB- 16 -RRB- -RRB- and the scaling factor 17We have also experimented with MERT <CIT> , and found that the deterministic annealing gave results that were more consistent across runs and often better '

'Our model exploits the same kind of tag-n-gram information that forms the core of many successful tagging models , for example , <OTH> , <OTH> , <CIT> '
'To some extent , this can probably be explained by the strong tradition of constituent analysis in Anglo-American linguistics , but this trend has been reinforced by the fact that the major treebank of American English , the Penn Treebank <CIT> , is annotated primarily with constituent analysis '
'As a side product , we find empirical evidence to suggest that the effectiveness of rule lexicalization techniques <CIT> and parent annotation techniques <OTH> is due to the fact that both lead to a reduction in perplexity in the automata induced from training corpora '

'The current state-of-the-art is to optimize these parameters with respect to the final evaluation criterion ; this is the so-called minimum error rate training <CIT> '
'Compared to a basic treebank grammar <OTH> , the grammars of highaccuracy parsers weaken independence assumptions by splitting grammar symbols and rules with either lexical <OTH> or nonlexical <CIT> conditioning information '
'Weight averaging was also employed <CIT> , which helped improve performance '
'As a result of this tuning , our -LRB- fully supervised -RRB- version of the Morce tagger gives the best accuracy among all single taggers for Czech and also very good results for English , being beaten only by the tagger <CIT> -LRB- by 010 % absolute -RRB- and -LRB- not significantly -RRB- by <OTH> '
'One widely used model is the IBM model <CIT> '
'Word segmentation and POS tagging in a joint process have received much attention in recent research and have shown improvements over a pipelined fashion <CIT> '

'This was recently followed by <CIT> who introduce state-of-the-art nearly unlexicalized PCFG parsers '
'Recent comparisons of approaches that can be trained on corpora <OTH> have shown that in most cases statistical aproaches <CIT> yield better results than finite-state , rule-based , or memory-based taggers <OTH> '
'Nowadays , most state-of-the-art SMT systems are based on bilingual phrases <CIT> '
'52 Results We use a Maximum Entropy -LRB- ME -RRB- classi er <CIT> which allows an e cient combination of many overlapping features '
'1 Introduction Syntactic methods are an increasingly promising approach to statistical machine translation , being both algorithmically appealing <CIT> and empirically successful <OTH> '
'3 Perceptron Reranking As <CIT> observes , perceptron training involves a simple , on-line algorithm , with few iterations typically required to achieve good performance '
'In order to estimate the conditional distributions shown in Table 1 , we use the general technique of choosing the MaxEnt distribution that properly estimates the average of each feature over the training data <CIT> '
'41 Features We used a dependency structure as the context for words because it is the most widely used and one of the best performing contextual information in the past studies <CIT> '
'This corpus-based information typically concerns sequences of 1-3 tags or words <CIT> '
'It has been argued that METEOR correlates better with human judgment due to higher weight on recall than precision <CIT> '
'2 Treebanking The Penn Treebank <CIT> is annotated with information to make predicate-argument structure easy to decode , including function tags and markers of empty categories that represent displaced constituents '
'For example , factored translation models <CIT> retain the simplicity of phrase-based SMT while adding the ability to incorporate additional features '
'Many machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to chunking tasks , such as Regularized Winnow <OTH> , SVMs <OTH> , CRFs <OTH> , Maximum Entropy Model <CIT> , Memory Based Learning <OTH> and SNoW <OTH> '
'Nowadays , most state-of-the-art SMT systems are based on bilingual phrases <CIT> '
'3 Probabilistic Parsing Models 31 Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars Lexicalization has been shown to improve parsing performance for the Penn Treebank <CIT> '
'The Perceptron style for natural language processing problems as initially proposed by <CIT> can provide state of the art results on various domains including text chunking , syntactic parsing , etc The main drawback of the Perceptron style algorithm is that it does not have a mechanism for attaining the maximize margin of the training data '
'The current state-of-the-art is to use minimum error rate training -LRB- MERT -RRB- as described in <CIT> '
'In this work , we propose two models that can be categorized as extensions of standard word lexicons : A discriminative word lexicon that uses global , ie sentence-level source information to predict the target words using a statistical classifier and a trigger-based lexicon model that extends the well-known IBM model 1 <CIT> with a second trigger , allowing for a more finegrained lexical choice of target words '
'<CIT> describe a more efficient algorithm that can compute all edge expectations in O -LRB- n3 -RRB- time using the inverse of the Kirchoff matrix K1 '
'Both <CIT> , and Tillmann and Zhang -LRB- 2006 -RRB- report on effective machine translation -LRB- MT -RRB- models involving large numbers of features with discriminatively trained weights '
'32 Comparison between SVM , Bootstrapping and LP For WSD , SVM is one of the state of the art supervised learning algorithms <OTH> , while bootstrapping is one of the state of the art semi-supervised learning algorithms <CIT> '
'Turning off the extensions to GIZA + + and training p0 as in <CIT> produces a substantial increase in AER '
'22 Maximum Entropy Models Maximum entropy -LRB- ME -RRB- models <CIT> , also known as 928 log-linear and exponential learning models , provide a general purpose machine learning technique for classification and prediction which has been successfully applied to natural language processing including part of speech tagging , named entity recognition etc Maximum entropy models can integrate features from many heterogeneous information sources for classification '
'Several recent real-world parsers have improved state-of-the-art parsing accuracy by relying on probabilistic or weighted versions of bilexical grammars <CIT> '
'<CIT> has described an ef cient exact one-dimensional error minimization technique for a similar search problem in machine translation '
'<CIT> do not achieve higher BLEU scores , but do score better according to human grammaticality judgments for in-coverage cases '
'Although they obtained consistent and stable performance gains for MT , these were inferior to the gains yielded by Ochs procedure in <CIT> '
'2 Evaluation Metrics Currently , the most widely used automatic MT evaluation metric is the NIST BLEU-4 <CIT> '
'Hiero Search Refinements <CIT> offer several refinements to cube pruning to improve translation speed '
'After a brief period following the introduction of generally accepted and widely used metrics, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002), when it seemed that this persistent problem has finally been solved, the researchers active in the field of machine translation (MT) started to express their worries that although these metrics are simple, fast and able to provide consistent results for a particular system during its development, they are not sufficiently reliable for the comparison of different systems or different language pairs.'
'However , in <CIT> , the authors investigate minimum translation units -LRB- MTU -RRB- which is a refinement over a similar approach by <OTH> to eliminate the overlap issue '
'Because of this property , vector space models have been used successfully both in computational linguistics <CIT> and in cognitive science <OTH> '
'1 Introduction The field of machine translation has seen many advances in recent years , most notably the shift from word-based <OTH> to phrasebased models which use token n-grams as translation units <CIT> '
'The remaining six entries were all fully automatic machine translation systems ; in fact , they were all phrase-based statistical machine translation system that had been trained on the same parallel corpus and most used Bleubased minimum error rate training <CIT> to optimize the weights of their log linear models feature functions <CIT> '
'<CIT> introduced the averaged perceptron , as a way of reducing overfitting , and it has been shown to perform better than the non-averaged version on a number of tasks '
'This averaging effect has been shown to reduce overfitting and produce much more stable results <CIT> '
'Probably the most widely used association weight function is -LRB- point-wise -RRB- Mutual Information -LRB- MI -RRB- <OTH> , <CIT> , <OTH> , <OTH> , defined by : -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- , -LRB- log -RRB- , -LRB- 2 fPwP fwPfwMI = A known weakness of MI is its tendency to assign high weights for rare features '
'<OTH> -RRB- , and Basque <OTH> , which pose quite different and in the end less severe problems , there have been attempts at solving this problem for some of the highly inflectional European languages , such as <OTH> , <OTH> -LRB- Slovenian -RRB- , <OTH> , <OTH> -LRB- Czech -RRB- and <OTH> -LRB- five Central and Eastern European languages -RRB- , but so far no system has reached in the absolute terms a performance comparable to English tagging -LRB- such as <CIT> -RRB- , which stands around or above 97 % '
'In order to overcome this problem , we look to the bootstrapping method outlined in <CIT> '
'Much later work <CIT> relies on the use of extremely large corpora which allow very precise , but sparse features '
'The simplest one is the BIO representation scheme <CIT> , where a B denotes the first item of an element and an I any non-initial item , and a syllable with tag O is not a part of any element '
'Conditional Markov models -LRB- CMM -RRB- <CIT> have been successfully used in sequence labeling tasks incorporating rich feature sets '
'To compare the output of their shallow parser with the output of the well-known <CIT> parser , Li and Roth applied the chunklink conversion script to extract the shallow constituents from the output of the Collins parser on WSJ section 00 '
'While the former is piecewise constant and thus can not be optimized using gradient techniques , <CIT> provides an approach that performs such training efficiently '
'Successful discriminative parsers have relied on generative models to reduce training time and raise accuracy above generative baselines <CIT> '
'Ochs procedure is the most widely-used version of MERT for SMT <CIT> '
'Some tasks can thrive on a nearly pure diet of unlabeled data <CIT> '
'4 Machine Translation Experiments 41 Experimental Setting For our MT experiments , we used a reimplementation of Moses <CIT> , a state-of-the-art phrase-based system '
'g2 2 Motivation The success of Statistical Machine Translation -LRB- SMT -RRB- has sparked a successful line of investigation that treats paraphrase acquisition and generation essentially as a monolingual machine translation problem <CIT> '
'22 Phrase-based Chinese-to-English MT The MT system used in this paper is Moses , a stateof-the-art phrase-based system <CIT> '
'<CIT> reports a success rate of 96 % disambiguating twelve words with two clear sense distinctions each one -RRB- '
'It is an online training algorithm and has been successfully used in many NLP tasks , such as POS tagging <OTH> , parsing <OTH> , Chinese word segmentation <CIT> , and so on '
'One major resource for corpus-based research is the treebanks available in many research organizations <CIT> , which carry skeletal syntactic structures or ` brackets '' that have been manually verified '
'Successful approaches aimed at trying to overcome the sparse data limitation include backoff <OTH> , Turing-Good variants <OTH> , interpolation <OTH> , deleted estimation <OTH> , similarity-based models <CIT> , Pos-language models <OTH> and decision tree models <OTH> '
'As aptly pointed out in Jean <CIT> , agreement measures proposed so far in the computational linguistics literature has failed to ask an important question of whether results obtained using agreement data are in any way different from random data '
'Many previous studies have shown that the log-likelihood ratio is well suited for this purpose <CIT> '
'Recent work , <CIT> , has shown that adding many millions of words of machine parsed and reranked LA Times articles does , in fact , improve performance of the parser on the closely related WSJ data '
'In addition to the widely used BLEU <CIT> and NIST <OTH> scores , we also evaluate translation quality with the recently proposed Meteor <OTH> and four edit-distance style metrics , Word Error Rate -LRB- WER -RRB- , Positionindependent word Error Rate -LRB- PER -RRB- <OTH> , CDER , which allows block reordering <OTH> , and Translation Edit Rate -LRB- TER -RRB- <OTH> '
'Most stateof-the-art SMT systems treat grammatical elements in exactly the same way as content words , and rely on general-purpose phrasal translations and target language models to generate these elements <CIT> '
'For instance , <CIT> shows that a simple feature augmentation method for SVM is able to effectively use both labeled target and source data to provide the best domainadaptation results in a number of NLP tasks '
'For English , we use three state-of-the-art taggers : the taggers of <OTH> and <CIT> in Step 1 , and the SVM tagger <OTH> in Step 3 '
'We used the average perceptron algorithm of <CIT> in our experiments , a variation that has been proven to be more effective than the standard algorithm shown in Figure 2 '
'More recently , phrase-based models <CIT> have been proposed as a highly successful alternative to the IBM models '
'Models that can handle non-independent lexical features have given very good results both for part-of-speech and structural disambiguation <CIT> '
'It is often straightforward to obtain large amounts of unlabeled data , making semi-supervised approaches appealing ; previous work on semisupervised methods for dependency parsing includes <CIT> '
'Recently , an elegant approach to inference in discourse interpretation has been developed at a number of sites <OTH> , all based on tim notion of abduction , and we have begun to explore its potential application to machine translation '
'The state of the art technology for relation extraction primarily relies on pattern-based approaches <CIT> '
'Many mainstream systems and formalisms would satisfy these criteria , including ones such as the University of Pennsylvania Treebank <CIT> which are purely syntactic -LRB- though of course , only syntactic properties could then be extracted -RRB- '
'The Penn Treebank <CIT> has until recently been the only such corpus , covering 45M words in a single genre of financial reporting '
'Some methods which can offer powerful reordering policies have been proposed like syntax based machine translation <OTH> and Inversion Transduction Grammar <CIT> '
'Recent work emphasizes corpus-based unsupervised approach <CIT> that avoids the need for costly truthed training data '
'We examine the effectiveness of Structural Correspondence Learning -LRB- SCL -RRB- <CIT> for this task , a recently proposed adaptation technique shown to be effective for PoS tagging and Sentiment Analysis '
'Online votedperceptrons have been reported to work well in a number of NLP tasks <CIT> '
'1 Introduction Large scale annotated corpora , eg , the Penn TreeBank -LRB- PTB -RRB- project <CIT> , have played an important role in text-mining '
'The fluency models hold promise for actual improvements in machine translation output quality <CIT> '
'The notion that nouns have only one sense per discourse\/collocation was also exploited by <CIT> in his seminal work on bootstrapping for word sense disambiguation '
'Using the components of the row-vector bm as feature function values for the candidate translation em -LRB- m a16 1 , , M -RRB- , the system prior weights can easily be trained using the Minimum Error Rate Training described in <CIT> '
'Bootstrapping a PMTG from a lower-dimensional PMTG and a word-to-word translation model is similar in spirit to the way that regular grammars can help to estimate CFGs <OTH> , and the way that simple translation models can help to bootstrap more sophisticated ones <CIT> '
'Semantic collocations are harder to extract than cooccurrence patterns--the state of the art does not enable us to find semantic collocations automatically t. This paper however argues that if we take advantage of lexicai paradigmatic behavior underlying the lexicon, we can at least achieve semi-automatic extraction of semantic collocations (see also Calzolari and Bindi (1990) I But note the important work by Hindle [HindlegO] on extracting semantically similar nouns based on their substitutability in certain verb contexts.'
'Extracting semantic information from word co-occurrence statistics has been effective , particularly for sense disambiguation <CIT> '
'High correlation is reported between the BLEU score and human evaluations for translations from Arabic , Chinese , French , and Spanish to English <CIT> '
'The maximum entropy approach <CIT> is known to be well suited to solve the classification problem '
'We compared a baseline system , the state-of-the-art phrase-based system Pharaoh <CIT> , against our system '
'The BLEU metric <CIT> in MT has been particularly successful ; for example MT05 , the 2005 NIST MT evaluation exercise , used BLEU-4 as the only method of evaluation '
'On the other hand , integrating an additional component into a baseline SMT system is notoriously tricky as evident in the research on integrating word sense disambiguation -LRB- WSD -RRB- into SMT systems : different ways of integration lead to conflicting conclusions on whether WSD helps MT performance <CIT> '
'This is analogous , and in a certain sense equivalent , to empirical risk minimization , which has been used successfully in related areas , such as speech recognition <OTH> , language modeling <OTH> , and machine translation <CIT> '
'<CIT> investigated the use of concurrent parsing of parallel corpora in a transduction inversion framework , helping to resolve attachment ambiguities in one language by the coupled parsing state in the second language '
'Sentence-level subjectivity detection , where training data is easier to obtain than for positive vs negative classification , has been successfully performed using supervised statistical methods alone <CIT> or in combination with a knowledgebased approach <OTH> '
'Properly calculated BLEU scores have been shown to correlate reliably with human judgments <CIT> '

'Recently , <CIT> have successfully constructed high quality and high coverage gazetteers from Wikipedia '
'1 Introduction The maximum entropy model <OTH> has attained great popularity in the NLP field due to its power , robustness , and successful performance in various NLP tasks <CIT> '
'The implementation of MEBA was strongly influenced by the notorious five IBM models described in <CIT> '
'Annotated reference corpora , such as the Brown Corpus <OTH> , the Penn Treebank <CIT> , and the BNC <OTH> , have helped both the development of English computational linguistics tools and English corpus linguistics '
'1 Introduction Syntactically annotated corpora like the Penn Treebank <CIT> , the NeGra corpus <OTH> or the statistically dismnbiguated parses in <OTH> provide a wealth of intbrmation , which can only be exploited with an adequate query language '
'Similarly , Structural Correspondence Learning <CIT> has proven to be successful for the two tasks examined , PoS tagging and Sentiment Classification '
'A notable exception is the work of <CIT> '
'Inversion Transduction Grammar -LRB- ITG -RRB- <CIT> and Syntax-Directed Translation Schema -LRB- SDTS -RRB- <OTH> lack both of these properties '
'Introduction Michael <CIT> parsing models have been quite influential in the field of natural language processing '
'We do not completely rule out the possibility that some more sophisticated , ontologically promiscuous , first-order analysis -LRB- perhaps along the lines of <CIT> -RRB- might account for these kinds of monotonicity inferences '
'It is promising to optimize the model parameters directly with respect to AER as suggested in statistical machine translation <CIT> '
'Recently , <CIT> suggest to mine semantic relatedness from Wikipedia , which can deal with the data sparseness problem suffered by using WordNet '
'2 Previous Work So far , Structural Correspondence Learning has been applied successfully to PoS tagging and Sentiment Analysis <CIT> '
'The well-known BLEU <CIT> is based on the number of common n-grams between the translation hypothesis and human reference translations of the same sentence '
'They are latent variable models which are not tractable to compute exactly , but two approximations exist which have been shown to be effective for constituent parsing <CIT> '
'Here we choose to work with stupid backoff smoothing <CIT> since this is significantly more efficient to train and deploy in a distributed framework than a contextdependent smoothing scheme such as Kneser-Ney '
'We can credit DUC with the emergence of automatic methods for evaluation such as ROUGE <CIT> which allow quick measurement of systems during development and enable evaluation of larger amounts of data '
'Preparing tagged corpora either by hand is labour-intensive and potentially error-prone , and although a semi-automatic approach can be used <CIT> , it is a good thing to reduce the human involvement as much as possible '
'Research in this direction was pioneered by <CIT> , who developed Inversion Transduction Grammars to capture crosslingual grammar variations such as phrase reorderings '
'Since its introduction to the Natural Language Processing -LRB- NLP -RRB- community <CIT> , ME-based classifiers have been shown to be effective in various NLP tasks '
'We employ a robust statistical parser <CIT> to determine the constituent structure for each sentence , from which subjects -LRB- s -RRB- , objects -LRB- o -RRB- , and relations other than subject or object -LRB- x -RRB- are identified '
'Unlike Choueka <OTH> , <CIT> identify as collocations both interrupted and uninterrupted sequences of words '
'The state-of-the-art SMT system Moses implements a distance-based reordering model <CIT> and a distortion model , operating with rewrite patterns extracted from a phrase alignment table <OTH> '
'Maximum Entropy -LRB- MaxEnt -RRB- principle has been successfully applied in many classification and tagging tasks <CIT> '
'In the well-known so-called IBM word alignment models <CIT> , re-estimating the model parameters depends on the empirical probability P -LRB- ek , fk -RRB- for each sentence pair -LRB- ek , fk -RRB- '
'The classification is performed with a statistical approach , built around the maximum entropy -LRB- MaxEnt -RRB- principle <CIT> , that has the advantage of combining arbitrary types of information in making a classification decision '
'Furthermore , the BLEU score performance suggests that our model is not very powerful , but some interesting hints can be found in Table 3 when we compare our method with a 5-gram language model to a state-of-the-art system Moses <CIT> based on various evaluation metrics , including BLEU score , NIST score <OTH> , METEOR <OTH> , TER <OTH> , WER and PER '
'Disambiguation of a limited number of words is not hard , and necessary context information can be carefully collected and hand-crafted to achieve high disambiguation accuracy as shown in <CIT> '
'<OTH> and Bikel and Chiang <OTH> has demonstrated the applicability of the <CIT> model for Czech and Chinese '
'One of the most successful metrics for judging machine-generated text is BLEU <CIT> '
'Among them , the unsupervised algorithm using decisiontrees <CIT> has achieved promising performance '
'Recent projects in semisupervised <CIT> and unsupervised <OTH> tagging also show significant progress '
'1 Introduction The emergence of phrase-based statistical machine translation -LRB- PSMT -RRB- <CIT> has been one of the major developments in statistical approaches to translation '
'Their idea has proven effective for estimating the statistics of unknown words in previous studies <CIT> '
'We use the popular online learning algorithm of structured perceptron with parameter averaging <CIT> '
'This algorithm is referred to as GHKM <CIT> and is widely used in SSMT systems <CIT> '
'Stochastic models <CIT> have been widely used in POS tagging for simplicity and language independence of the models '
'<CIT> solved relational similarity problems using the Web as a corpus '
'Albeit simple , the algorithm has proven to be very efficient and accurate for the task of parse selection <CIT> '
'Two popular techniques that incorporate the error criterion are Minimum Error Rate Training -LRB- MERT -RRB- <CIT> and Minimum BayesRisk -LRB- MBR -RRB- decoding <OTH> '
'Besides relative frequencies , lexical weights <CIT> are widely used to estimate how well the words in f translate the words in e To do this , one needs first to estimate a lexical translation probability distribution w -LRB- e f -RRB- by relative frequency from the same word alignments in the training corpus : w -LRB- e f -RRB- = count -LRB- f , e -RRB- summationtext e count -LRB- f , e -RRB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- Note that a special source NULL token is added to each source sentence and aligned to each unaligned target word '
'Perhaps more importantly , discriminative models have been shown to offer competitive performance on a variety of sequential and structured learning tasks in NLP that are traditionally tackled via generative models , such as letter-to-phoneme conversion <OTH> , semantic role labeling <OTH> , syntactic parsing <OTH> , language modeling <OTH> , and machine translation <CIT> '
'While error-driven training techniques are commonly used to improve the performance of phrasebased translation systems <CIT> , this paper presents a novel block sequence translation approach to SMT that is similar to sequential natural language annotation problems 727 such as part-of-speech tagging or shallow parsing , both in modeling and parameter training '
'5 Bidirectional Sequence Classification Bidirectional POS tagging <CIT> , the current state of the art for English , has some properties that make it appropriate for Icelandic '
'We chose the perceptron for the training algorithm because it has shown good performance on other NLP tasks ; in particular , <CIT> reported good performance for a perceptron tagger compared to a Maximum Entropy tagger '
'The state-of-the art taggers are using feature sets discribed in the corresponding articles -LRB- <CIT> , <OTH> , <OTH> and <OTH> -RRB- , Morce supervised and Morce semi-supervised are using feature set desribed in section 4 '
'<CIT> saw a LFMS improvement of 08 % over their baseline discriminative parser after adding punctuation features , one of which encoded the sentence-final punctuation '
'The current state of the art is represented by the so-called phrase-based translation approach <CIT> '
'In addition to the classical window-based technique , some studies investigated the use of lexico-syntactic patterns -LRB- eg , X or Y -RRB- to get more accurate co-occurrence statistics <CIT> '
'Among the various knowledge-based <OTH> and data-driven <CIT> word sense disambiguation methods that have been proposed to date , supervised systems have been constantly observed as leading to the highest performance '
'Discriminative taggers and chunkers have been the state-of-the-art for more than a decade <CIT> '
'To alleviate this effort , various semi-supervised learning algorithms such as self-training <CIT> , cotraining <OTH> , transductive SVM <OTH> and many others have been proposed and successfully applied under different assumptions and settings '
'Then the same system weights are applied to both IncHMM and Joint Decoding - based approaches , and the feature weights of them are trained using the max-BLEU training method proposed by Och <OTH> and refined by <CIT> '
'Aside from purely linguistic interest , bracket structure has been empirically shown to be highly effective at constraining subsequent training of , for example , stochastic context-free grammars <OTH> '
'Word segmentation and POS tagging in a joint process have received much attention in recent research and have shown improvements over a pipelined fashion <CIT> '
'35 Anaphoricity Determination Finally , several coreference systems have successfully incorporated anaphoricity determination 660 modules -LRB- eg Ng and Cardie <OTH> and <CIT> -RRB- '
'1 Introduction Phrase-based statistical machine translation models <CIT> have achieved significant improvements in translation accuracy over the original IBM word-based model '
'1 Introduction Todays statistical machine translation systems rely on high quality phrase translation pairs to acquire state-of-the-art performance , see <CIT> '
'There is usually not a considerable difference between the two methods in terms of the accuracy of the resulting model <CIT> , but L1 regularization has a significant advantage in practice '
'We have chosen the Maximum Entropy tagger <CIT> for a comparison with our universal tagger , since it achieved -LRB- by a small margin -RRB- the best overall result on Slovene as reported there <OTH> of taggers available to us -LRB- MBT , the best overall , was not freely available to us at the time of writing -RRB- '
'The pioneering work of <CIT> introduced NP chunking as a machine-learning problem , with standard datasets and evaluation metrics '
'Furthermore , good results have been produced in other areas of NLP research using maximum entropy techniques <CIT> '
'3 Experiments We evaluated the effect of random feature mixing on four popular learning methods : Perceptron , MIRA <OTH> , SVM and Maximum entropy ; with 4 NLP datasets : 20 Newsgroups1 , Reuters <OTH> , Sentiment <CIT> and Spam <OTH> '
'Currently , the best-performing English NP interpretation methods in computational linguistics focus mostly on two consecutive noun instances -LRB- noun compounds -RRB- and are either -LRB- weakly -RRB- supervised , knowledge-intensive <OTH> , <OTH> , <OTH> , <OTH> , <OTH> , <OTH> , <CIT> , <OTH> , or use statistical models on large collections of unlabeled data <OTH> , <OTH> , <OTH> , <OTH> '
'Empirically the BLEU score has a high correlation with human evaluation when N = 4 for English translation evaluations <CIT> '
'Brute-force methods -LRB- ie those that exploit the massive raw computing power currently available cheaply -RRB- may well produce some useful results <CIT> '
'Recent work has applied Bayesian non-parametric models to anaphora resolution <CIT> , lexical acquisition <OTH> and language modeling <OTH> with good results '
'However , the learning curve for Negra -LRB- see Figure 1 -RRB- indicates that the performance of the <CIT> model is stable , even for small training sets '
'This approach took inspiration from the pioneering work by <CIT> , but it is also fundamentally different , because instead of grouping similar senses together , the CoreLex approach groups together words according to all of their senses '
'They have been successfully applied to accent restoration , word '' sense disambiguation 209 and homograph disambiguation <CIT> '
'Generative word alignment models , initially developed at IBM <CIT> , and then augmented by an HMM-based model <OTH> , have provided powerful modeling capability for word alignment '
'The limitations of the generative approach to sequence tagging , i e Hidden Markov Models , have been overcome by discriminative approaches proposed in recent years <CIT> '
'GIZA + + <CIT> is a very popular system within SMT for creating word alignment from parallel corpus , in fact , the Moses training scripts uses it '
'For English , self-training contributes 083 % absolute improvement to the PCFG-LA parser , which is comparable to the improvement obtained from using semi-supervised training with the twostage parser in <CIT> '
'They are central to many parsing models <CIT> , and despite their simplicity n-gram models have been very successful '
'1 Introduction In recent years , statistical machine translation have experienced a quantum leap in quality thanks to automatic evaluation <CIT> and errorbased optimization <OTH> '
'First , such a system makes use of lexical information when modeling reordering <CIT> , which has previously been shown to be useful in German-to-English translation <OTH> '
'This representation , being contiguous on both sides , successfully reduces the decoding complexity to a low polynomial and significantly improved the search quality <CIT> '
'We report on ROUGE-1 -LRB- unigrams -RRB- , ROUGE-2 -LRB- bigrams -RRB- , ROUGE W-12 -LRB- weighted LCS -RRB- , and ROUGE-S \* -LRB- skip bigrams -RRB- as they have been shown to correlate well with human judgments for longer multidocument summaries <CIT> '
'<OTH> , but we use a maximum entropy classifier <CIT> to determine parser actions , which makes parsing considerably faster '
'Recently , <CIT> have successfully applied self-training to various parser adaptation scenarios using the reranking parser of <OTH> '
'An efficient algorithm for performing this tuning for a larger number of model parameters can be found in <CIT> '
'Beam-search has been successful in many NLP tasks -LRB- Koehn et al , 2003 ; 562 Inputs : training examples -LRB- xi , yi -RRB- Initialization : set vectorw = 0 Algorithm : \/ \/ R training iterations ; N examples for t = 1R , i = 1N : zi = argmaxyGEN -LRB- xi -RRB- -LRB- y -RRB- vectorw if zi negationslash = yi : vectorw = vectorw + -LRB- yi -RRB- -LRB- zi -RRB- Outputs : vectorw Figure 1 : The perceptron learning algorithm <CIT> and Roark , 2004 -RRB- , and can achieve accuracy that is close to exact inference '
'By having the advantage of leveraging large parallel corpora , the statistical MT approach outperforms the traditional transfer based approaches in tasks for which adequate parallel corpora is available <CIT> '
'More sophisticated first-order accounts <CIT> may be extendable to bear this load '

evaluatmn of WSD algorithms One would prefer to define a dusamblguatlon task for which there us reasonably hlgh agreement between human annotators The agreement rate between human annotators will then form the upper ceiling against whmh to compare the performance of WSD algorithms For instance, the SENSEVAL exerclse has performed a detaded study to find out the raterannotator agreement among ~ts lexicographers taggrog the word senses (Kllgamff, 1998c, Kllgarnff, 1998a, Kflgarrlff, 1998b) 2 A Case Study In this-paper, we examine the ~ssue of raterannotator agreement by comparing the agreement rate of human annotators on a large sense-tagged corpus of more than 30,000 instances of the most frequently occurring nouns and verbs of Enghsh This corpus is the intersection of the WORDNET Semcor corpus (Miller et al, 1993) and the DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996, Ng, 1997), which has been independently tagged wlth the refined senses of WORDNET by two separate groups of human annotators The Semcor corpus us a subset of the Brown corpus tagged with ~VoRDNET senses, and consists of more than 670,000 words from 352 text files Sense taggmg was done on the content words (nouns, ~erbs, adjectives and adverbs) m this subset The DSO corpus consists of sentences drawn from the Brown corpus and the Wall Street Journal For each word w from a hst of 191 frequently occurring words of Enghsh (121 nouns and 70 verbs), sentences containing w (m singular or plural form, and m its various reflectional verb form) are selected and each word occurrence w ~s tagged w~th a sense from WoRDNET There ~s a total of about 192,800 sentences in the DSO corpus m which one word occurrence has been sense-tagged m each sentence The intersection of the Semcor corpus and the DSO corpus thus consists of Brown corpus sentences m which a word occurrence w is sense-tagged m each sentence, where w Is one of.the 191 frequently oc-,currmg English nouns or verbs Since this common pomon has been sense-tagged by two independent groups of human annotators, ~t serves as our data set for investigating inter-annotator agreement in this paper 3 Sentence Matching To determine the extent of inter-annotator agreement, the first step ~s to match each sentence m Semcor to its corresponding counterpart In the DSO corpus This step ~s comphcated by the following factors 1 Although the intersected portion of both corpora came from Brown corpus, they adopted different tokemzatmn convention, and segmentartan into sentences differed sometimes 2 The latest versmn of Semcor makes use of the senses from WORDNET 1 6, whereas the senses used m the DSO corpus were from WoRDNET 15 1 To match the sentences, we first converted the senses m the DSO corpus to those of WORDNET 1 6 We ignored all sentences m the DSO corpus m which a word is tagged with sense 0 or -1 (A word is tagged with sense 0 or -1 ff none of the given senses m WoRDNFT applies ) 4, sentence from Semcor is considered to match one from the DSO corpus ff both sentences are exactl) ldent~cal or ff the~ differ only m the pre~ence or absence of the characters '' (permd) or -'' (hyphen) For each remaining Semcor sentence, taking into account word ordering, ff 75% or more of the words m the sentence match those in a DSO corpus sentence, then a potential match ~s recorded These i -kctua[ly, the WORD~q''ET senses used m the DSO corpus were from a shght variant of the official WORDNE''I 1 5 release Th~s ssas brought to our attention after the pubhc release of the DSO corpus potential matches are then manually verffied to ensure that they are true matches and to ~eed out any false matches Using this method of matching, a total of 13,188 sentence-palrs contasnmg nouns and 17,127 sentence-pa~rs containing verbs are found to match from both corpora, ymldmg 30,315 sentences which form the intersected corpus used m our present study 4 The Kappa Statistic Suppose there are N sentences m our corpus where each sentence contains the word w Assume that w has M senses Let 4 be the number of sentences which are assigned identical sense b~ two human annotators Then a simple measure to quantify the agreement rate between two human annotators Is Pc, where Pc, = A/N The drawback of this simple measure is that it does not take into account chance agreement between two annotators The Kappa statistic a (Cohen, 1960) is a better measure of rater-annotator agreement which takes into account the effect of chance agreement It has been used recently w~thm computatmnal hngu~stlcs to measure raterannotator agreement (Bruce and Wmbe, 1998, Carletta, 1996, Veroms, 1998) Let Cj be the sum of the number of sentences which have been assigned sense 3 by annotator 1 and the number of sentences whmh have been assigned sense 3 by annotator 2 Then P~-P~ 1-P~ where M j=l and Pe measures the chance agreement between two annotators A Kappa ~alue of 0 indicates that the agreement is purely due to chance agreement, whereas a Kappa ~alue of 1 indicates perfect agreement A Kappa ~alue of 0 8 and above is considered as mdmatmg good agreement (Carletta, 1996) Table 1 summarizes the inter-annotator agreement on the mtersected corpus The first (becond) row denotes agreement on the nouns (xerbs), wh~le the lass row denotes agreement on all words combined The a~erage ~ reported m the table is a s~mpie average of the individual ~ value of each word The agreement rate on the 30,315 sentences as measured by P= is 57% This tallies with the figure reported ~n our earlier paper (Ng and Lee, 1996) where we performed a quick test on a subset of 5,317 sentences,n the intersection of both the Semcor corpus and the DSO corpus 10 [] mm m m m m m mm m m m m mm m m m Type Num of v, ords A N [ P~ Avg

the intersected corpus is not high, we would like to find out how the agreement rate would be affected if different sense classes were in use In this section, we present a greedy search algorithm that can automatmalb derive coarser sense classes based on the sense tags assigned by two human annotators The resulting derived coarse sense classes achmve a higher agreement rate but we still maintain as many of the original sense classes as possible The algorithm is given m Figure 1 The algorithm operates on a set of sentences where each sentence contains an occurrence of the word w whmh has been sense-tagged by two human annotators At each Iteration of the algorithm, tt finds the pair of sense classes Ct and Cj such that merging these two sense classes results in the highest t~ value for the resulting merged group of sense classes It then proceeds to merge Cz and C~ Thin process Is repeated until the ~ value reaches a satisfactory value ~,~t,~, which we set as 0 8 Note that this algorithm is also applicable to deriving any coarser set of classes from a refined set for any NLP tasks in which prior human agreement rate may not be high enough Such NLP tasks could be discourse tagging, speech-act categorization, etc 6 Results For each word w from the list of 121 nouns and 70 verbs, ~e applied the greedy search algorithm to each set of sentences in the intersected corpus contaming w For a subset of 95 words (53 nouns and 42 verbs), the algorithm was able to derive a coarser set of 2 or more senses for each of these 95 words such that the resulting Kappa ~alue reaches 0 8 or higher For the other 96 words, m order for the Kappa value to reach 0 8 or higher, the algorithm collapses all senses of the ~ord to a single (trivial) class Table 2 and 3 summarizes the results for the set of 53 nouns and 42 ~erbs, respectively Table 2 md~cates that before the collapse of sense classes, these 53 nouns have an average of 7 6 senses per noun There is a total of 5,339 sentences in the intersected corpus containing these nouns, of which 3,387 sentences were assigned the same sense by the two groups of human annotators The average Kappa statistic (computed as a simple average of the Kappa statistic of ~he mdlwdual nouns) is 0 463 After the collapse of sense classes by the greedy search algorithm, the average number of senses per noun for these 53 nouns drops to 40 Howe~er, the number of sentences which have been asmgned the same coarse sense by the annotators increases to 5,033 That is, about 94 3% of the sentences have been assigned the same coarse sense, and that the average Kappa statistic has improved to 0 862, mgmfymg high rater-annotator agreement on the derived coarse senses Table3 gl~es the analogous figures for the 42 verbs, agmn mdmatmg that high agreement is achieved on the coarse sense classes den~ed for verbs 7 Discussion Our findings on rater-annotator agreement for word sense tagging indicate that for average language users, it is quite dl~cult to achieve high agreement when they are asked to assign refned sense tags (such as those found in WORDNET) given only the scanty definition entries m the WORDNET dlctionary and a few or no example sentences for the usage of each word sense Thin observation agrees wlth that obtmned m a recent study done by (Veroms, 1998), where the agreement on sense-tagging by naive users was also not hlgh Thus It appears that an average language user is able to process language wlthout needing to perform the task of dlsamblguatmg word sense to a very fine-grained resolutmn as formulated m a tradltlonal dmtlonary In contrast, expert lexicographers tagged the ~ ord sense in the sentences used m the SENSEVAL exerclse, where high rater-annotator agreement was reported There are also fuller dlctlonary entries m the HECTOR dlctlonary used and more e<amples showing the usage of each word sense m HECTOR These factors are likely to have contributed to the difference in rater-annotator agreement observed m the three studies conducted We also examined the coarse sense classes derived by the greedy search algorithm Vv''e found some interesting groupings of coarse senses for nouns which ~e hst in Table 4 From Table 4, it is apparent that the greedy search algorithm can derive interesting groupings of word senses that correspond to human mtmtwe judgment of sense graz}.ulanty It Is clear that some of the disagreement between the two groups of human annotators can be attributed solely to the overly refined senses of WoRDNET As an example, there is a total Ii loop: let Ct,, C M denote the current M sense classes ~* +--oo for all z,3 such that 1 <, < 3 < M let C[,,C~w_ 1 denote the resulting M 1 sense classes by mergmg C, and C 3 compute ~(C[,, C~/_t) ff ~(C,, C~4_x) > ~* then ~''

"To characterize the distribution of horizontal velocity increments at the model highest resolution, we use the uniform-resolution 30 km simulation described by Rauscher_et al._(2013)_CITE"
"The model is configured in accord with the aquaplanet protocol specified by Neale_and_Hoskins_(2000)_CITE, in which the surface of the simulated planet is covered with water, and all boundary conditions are specified with rotational (in the direction of planetary rotation) and hemispheric symmetry"
"The dashed gray lines in the figures show a power-law fit, using the York_et al._(2004)_CITE maximum likelihood method, to the structure functions for increment distances ranging between approximately 100 and 500 km"
"Additionally, since it is hypothesized that there should be a scale-break for distances greater than approximately 500 km (eg, Nastrom_and_Gage,_1985_CITE), we restrict our fit to increment distances less than or equal to this value"
This is consistent with the first-order structure function of the water vapor field reported by Pressel_(2012)_CITE for a similar model configuration
The Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE method simultaneously and objectively determines both the optimal shape and optimal bandwidth for a kernel density estimate

"Thus, already existing executable operation specifications can be reused directly from previous work ( Brosch_et_al.,_2009_CITE) or new composite operations may be defined easily using existing operation specification tools (eg, Arendt_et_al.,_2010;_Brosch_et_al.,_2009_CITE) without having to keep the detection rules consistent with the specifications for their execution"
"Current model comparison tools apply a two-phase process: (i) correspondences between model elements are computed by model matching algorithms ( Kolovos_et_al.,_2009_CITE), and (ii) a model diffing phase computes the differences between two models from the established correspondences"

"Most of these approaches are based on popular supervised learning algorithms such as SVM ( Andrews_et_al.,_2003_CITE) or boosting ( Viola_et_al.,_2005_CITE), that are adapted in order to incorporate the MIL constraints."
"In particular, we build on Babenko et al Babenko_et_al._(2009)_CITE and use a different loss function, optimizing the binary log likelihood over bags in form of (5)logL= i(yilogp(yi)+(1-yi)log(1-p(yi))),where the instance probability can be estimated using a sigmoid function (6)p(y|x)= (H(x))=11+e-H(x),which requires a gradient descent in function space"
"We first give an illustrative comparison between the original grid approach (eg, Roth_et_al.,_2009_CITE) and the proposed method"

Some new interesting variants of LPP are introduced in [113]_CITE.
"Since the proof is standard, it is omitted (see, Proposition 3.11 in [3]_CITE)"
"Regression testing ( Yoo_and_Harman,_2012_CITE) is a widely-practiced activity in real-world software development projects ( Onoma_et_al.,_1998_CITE), in which a better testing infrastructure has a potential to recover the economic loss resulting from software failures by one third ( Tassey,_2002_CITE)"
"We have further performed a case study on the comparison of our LBS search algorithm to the algorithms of Greedy ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002_CITE), ART ( Jiang_et_al.,_2009_CITE), and Genetic ( Li_et_al.,_2007_CITE) by encoding test cases using input information and using the even-spread of test cases as the guidance heuristic to determine whether the performance of our techniques is merely attributed to the LBS algorithm"
"In both validations, we measured their effectiveness in terms of the average rate of fault detection (ie, APFD ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002_CITE)) and the time spent in generating a resultant prioritized test suite."
"This work significantly extends its preliminary version ( Jiang_and_Chan,_2013_CITE): (1) It generalizes the family of LBS techniques by presenting five more new techniques and evaluates the family against more existing techniques for benchmarking"
"The main contribution of the paper together with its preliminary version ( Jiang_and_Chan,_2013_CITE) is twofold"
"In our experiment, we follow the algorithm presented in ( Li_et_al.,_2007_CITE) to implement the technique."
"In the evaluation of this work, we follow the implementation consideration presented in ( Li_et_al.,_2007_CITE)"
"Thus, unlike the greedy techniques ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002_CITE) that select the successors among all not yet covered test cases, our LBS techniques are designed to save time by randomly sampling a candidate set of c successors from all possible successors for each state as Jiang et al Jiang_et_al._(2011)_CITE did"
"LBS can be regarded as a novel class of ART ( Jiang_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Following ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002_CITE), we used all the faulty versions whose faults can be revealed by more than 0% and less than 20% of the test cases."
"For the number of runs per test case prioritization technique, according to ( Arcuri_and_Briand,_2011_CITE), 1000 runs per subject are sufficient to evaluate a randomized technique on the subject"
"We extracted the command line and file contents as strings, and use the edit distance ( Gusfield,_1997_CITE) as function f 1."
We selected them because these are representative search-based techniques for test case prioritization and they are evaluated in the experiment reported by Li_et_al._(2007_CITE)
Our implementation of total statement and additional statement follows strictly according to the algorithms described in Elbaum_et_al._(2002_CITE)
"Following ( Jiang_et_al.,_2009_CITE), we further perform both the ANOVA test and the multiple comparisons between each pair of techniques to check whether their means are different significantly on each program"
"The way we generated branch-adequate test suite was the same as the procedure reported in ( Do_et_al.,_2008_CITE), and the use of branch-adequate test suites was popularly used in test case prioritization research studies ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002;_Jiang_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"We measured the efficiency of a test case prioritization technique by its time cost, which is also adopted in Jiang_et_al._(2009_CITE)."
This finding is consistent to the claim by Zhang_et_al._(2013_CITE) that Additional Greedy is still the most effective coverage-based strategy in terms of APFD.
"We have adopted three search-based algorithms, ie, Genetic ( Li_et_al.,_2007_CITE), ART ( Jiang_et_al.,_2009_CITE), and Greedy algorithms for evaluation"
"For the ART algorithm, we use the same algorithm as described in ( Jiang_et_al.,_2009_CITE), except we use input distance rather than code coverage-based test case distance"
"Since the Genetic, ART, and LBS algorithms all involved randomness, we also set the number of repeated trials for each technique as 50 as what we did in ( Jiang_et_al.,_2009_CITE)."
"Furthermore, we also used the edit distance ( Gusfield,_1997_CITE) for measuring test case distance"
"We recall that in evolutionary computing, there is a famous conjecture, informally known as the No Free Lunch theorem ( Wolpert_and_Macready,_1997_CITE)"

"On the other hand, Mei_et_al._(2015b)_CITE proposed a novel refinement-oriented level-exploration (ROLE) strategy and presented the first provable hierarchy of test case prioritization techniques for testing of services"

We refer the reader to Neisse_et al._(2015)_CITE for a complete description of all operators and semantics of the language.
"We adopt a design language where behaviours are represented by rounded rectangles and the contribution or participation of each behaviour in an interaction by half ellipses, details about this language are described in Neisse_et al._(2015)_CITE."
In order to map high-level policies to their low-level enforceable counterparts we build on the policy refinement approach introduced by Neisse_and_Doerr_CITE (2013)
"The decompilation is performed using the ApkTool ( Tumbleson_and_Winiewski,_2010_CITE), which generates as output the smali code of all classes which are part of the app"
"To do this, our static analysis tools extract all the methods and permission list incorporated in the examined app and correlate them with the API map published by Felt_et al._(2011)_CITE to identify all the sensitive API method invocations"

"For our study, we chose the popular decision tree classifier C4.5, which builds decision trees using the concept of information entropy ( Quinlan,_1993_CITE)"
A more detailed explanation of how to train a random forest can be found in Breiman_(2001)_CITE
The performance criterion chosen to measure this effect is the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) statistic as proposed by Baesens_et_al._(2003)_CITE.
"The AUC statistic was computed using the ROC macro by DeLong,_DeLong,_and_Clarke-Pearson_(1988)_CITE, which is available from the SAS website ( HYPERLINK."
"For the LS-SVM, the LS-SVMlab Matlab toolbox developed by Suykens_et_al._(2002)_CITE was used."

"The k-Nearest Neighbours technique was applied for both k = 10 and k = 100, using the Weka ( Witten_&_Frank,_2005_CITE) IBk classifier"
For the gradient boosting classifier a partitioning algorithm was used as proposed by Friedman_(2001)_CITE
"We used Friedman test ( Friedman,_1940_CITE) to compare the AUCs of the different classifiers"
"The Friedman statistic is well suited for this type of data analysis as it is less susceptible to outliers ( Friedman,_1940_CITE)."
"The post hoc Nemenyi test ( Nemenyi,_1963_CITE) is applied to report any significant differences between individual classifiers"
"Finally, the results from Friedman statistic and the Nemenyi post hoc tests are displayed using a modified version of Dem ar_(2006)_CITE significance diagrams ( Lessmann,_Baesens,_Mues,_&_Pietsch,_2008_CITE)"
This finding seems to confirm the suggestion made in Baesens_et_al._(2003)_CITE that most credit scoring data sets are only weakly non-linear
"Since the work of Haralick [8]_CITE, considerable effort has been dedicated to find strategies that quantify how image pixels are distributed within local regions or neighbourhoods"
"The local arrangement of pixels is quantified by means of a connectivity index, similar to that proposed in [5]_CITE and which represents the number of connected pixels (in Graph Theory sense) to the central pixel of a neighbourhood"
"Finally, the descriptors are provided by the cumulative distribution of the connectivity index, as computed in [5]_CITE, on the entire image and for the different neighbourhood sizes (radii)."
"Three data sets commonly used in the literature were employed for this purpose, namely, UIUC [9]_CITE, Outex [13]_CITE, and KTH-TIPS2b [2]_CITE"
"To evaluate the classification performance, the proposed descriptors were also compared to other state-of-the-art and classical texture descriptors: Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) [8]_CITE, Fourier [7]_CITE, multifractals [19]_CITE, Local Binary Patterns (LBP) [14]_CITE, LBP+VAR [14]_CITE, and MR8 [17]_CITE."
The concept of local connectivity in image textures was first presented in [5]_CITE as a measure of local regularity in the context of a multifractal analysis
"Therefore, a new definition for adjacency was established in [5]_CITE based on Euclidean distances between points: two points p with coordinates ( x 1, y 1, z 1) and q with coordinates ( x 2, y 2, z 2), both in E 3, are considered adjacent if they are at a distance smaller than a pre-defined threshold t: (2)"
More details and a pseudo-code is provided in [5]_CITE for the interested reader.
"The proposed descriptors were assessed in the classification of three established databases of texture images, namely, UIUC [9]_CITE, Outex [13]_CITE, and KTH-TIPS2b [2]_CITE"
"The connectivity features were compared to other state-of-the-art and classical approaches for texture classification in the literature, ie Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) [8]_CITE, Fourier [7]_CITE, multifractals [19]_CITE, Local Binary Patterns (LBP) [14]_CITE, LBP +VAR [14]_CITE, and MR8 [17]_CITE."
"As a starting point we have attempted to reproduce the best results reported in [17]_CITE, ie 73.2% 10-fold cross-validation 5 5Cross-validation (CV) is a standard statistical technique for estimation of model generalization ability, ie assessing how the model will perform on new, previously unseen data [16]"
In our experiments a Support Vector Classifier ( svc) from the PRTools Pattern Recognition Toolbox version 4.2.1 for MATLAB [12]_CITE has been used.
"Rather than building complex ensemble models, we have first opted for a set of basic classifiers included in the PRTools toolbox their list has been given in Table 1 , while their classification accuracy assessed using the same approach as in [17]_CITE has been reported in Table 2 ."
"In our experience greedy approaches work surprisingly well (see [5,6]_CITE for example), often outperforming stochastic methods like genetic algorithms or simulated annealing, when a strict time limit is imposed on the optimization process"
"Although we believe the results could be further improved, for example by employing ensemble models as discussed in [17]_CITE, we consider that the point has been proven and rather focus on examining the best model in more detail."

"In this paper we have given a brief introduction to the use of APFA to model discrete longitudinal data, and adapted an algorithm proposed by Ron_et al._(1998)_CITE and implemented (with modifications) by Browning_and_Browning_(2007a)_CITE, so that this seeks to minimize a penalized likelihood criterion, for example AIC or BIC"
"The improvement over Beagle is substantial when the settings suggested in Browning_and_Browning_(2007a)_CITE ( m=4 and b=0.2) are used, but when the settings implicit in Browning_(2006)_CITE ( m=1 and b=0) are chosen the performance of the two algorithms was very similar"
"It is commonly used to compare non-nested models ( Kent,_1986_CITE)"
We applied content analysis to the 60 negotiation transcripts following the five stage model suggested by Srnka and Koeszegi [73]_CITE
"In this paper, we extend that model from a stimulus-driven model to one which also considers attentional input: specifically, we test the idea that effects of spatial and feature-based attention are based on very similar mechanisms ( Maunsell_&_Treue,_2006_CITE)"
"We then used Akaike information criterion (AIC) ( Akaike,_1974;_deLeeuw,_1992_CITE) to determine the least distance |la lv| at which the stimulus selection model described the distribution of localizations better than the integration model (columns aVa, avA, aVA, ava in subtables of Table 1)."
"Our model fits in well with the view recently expressed by Krauzlis,_Bollimunta,_Arcizet,_and_Wang_(2014)_CITE that attention may be not so much a mechanism causing certain behavioral and neural phenomena, but an effect emerging from the need for effective information processing"
"This view fits in well with previous work by Krauzlis_et al._(2014)_CITE who argued that attention may, on the network level, be seen not as a cause but an effect of the ecological requirements on information processing"
"Notable successes have been achieved for problems such as test data generation, modularisation, automated patching, and regression testing, with industrial uptake ( Cornford_et_al.,_2003;_Wegener_and_B hler,_2004;_Afzal_et_al.,_2010;_Lakhotia_et_al.,_2010b;_Cadar_et_al.,_2011;_Yoo_et_al.,_2011_CITE) and the provision of tools such as AUSTIN ( Lakhotia_et_al.,_2010a_CITE), Bunch ( Mitchell_and_Mancoridis,_2006_CITE), EvoSuite ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2011_CITE), GenProg ( Le_Goues_et_al.,_2012_CITE), Milu ( Jia_and_Harman,_2008_CITE) and SWAT ( Alshahwan_and_Harman,_2011_CITE)."
"There are many surveys, overviews and reviews of SBSE that provide more in-depth treatment and coverage of results specific to individual engineering subdisciplines such as requirements analysis ( Zhang_et_al.,_2008_CITE), predictive modelling ( Harman,_2010;_Afzal_and_Torkar,_2011_CITE), non-functional properties ( Afzal_et_al.,_2009_CITE), program comprehension ( Harman,_2007_CITE), design ( R ih ,_2010_CITE) and testing ( McMinn,_2004;_Harman,_2008;_Afzal_et_al.,_2009;_Ali_et_al.,_2010_CITE)"
"To build on the formulation from Lee_and_Zomaya_(2012)_CITE, a servers i out of w servers belongs to the set S, and the utilisation U i of a single server i S can be described as the sum of the utilisation u i,j due to each resident virtual machine vj running on i thus:"
"The CloudSim toolkit ( Calheiros_et_al.,_2011_CITE) provides an appropriate level of abstraction for this evaluation function and was used previously by Beloglazov_and_Buyya_(2010)_CITE."

"From [3]_CITE is seen, that the proved theorem is original and it is proved for the first time (see Figs_1 4 of the present article)."
"This paper led me to classical papers by Peter Whittle [9]_CITE, Yu Rozanov [7]_CITE, John Woods [10]_CITE and Julian Besag [1]_CITE, as well as the paper by Besag and Moran [2]_CITE on parameter estimation in Gaussian Markov random field models"
David Cooper was also vigorously pursuing Bayesian methods for boundary and object recognition [4]_CITE
"A seismic shift occurred in 1984 thanks to the seminal paper on simulated annealing, stochastic relaxation and MAP restoration of images by Geman and Geman [5]_CITE that appeared in PAMI"
A deterministic alternative known as the iterated condition mode was presented in the paper by Besag [3]_CITE on statistical analysis of dirty pictures that appeared in the Journal of Royal Statistical Society
A good example of the impact of MRF-driven methods is the well cited paper on the comparison of energy minimization methods for MRFs that appeared in PAMI in 2008 [8]_CITE.
"In their survey, they mention the work of Stikic et al [37]_CITE, where different directions are proposed to bridge the gap between state-of-the-art activity recognition approaches and real-world deployment of activity recognition systems; they built an unobtrusive activity recognition system that requires minimal user involvement in the training process."
Selvaraj [35]_CITE investigated the effectiveness of patch sensors for continuous and long-term monitoring in older subjects over 50 consecutive days at their home setting; results confirmed that patch sensors are suitable for long-term vital sign monitoring as they achieve high accuracy measurements and positive user feedback for home use
Roggen et al [34]_CITE contributed with an extensive complex dataset that has been a benchmark in the HAR field
"Based on the referenced literature [2 5]_CITE, we modified (B) (B ), which represents the fuzzy-state assumption"
"Using the decomposition theory, we obtained the following result: (9)A = 0 Using a method similar to that of Yao and Wu [13]_CITE, we considered the signed distance and ranking on F IV( , )"
"Using the same arguments as those of Yao and Wu [13]_CITE, we obtained the following properties: Property 1If A ,B FIV( , ),(FIV( , ), , ) satisfies the law of trichotomy"
"By applying the method of Kaufmann and Gupta [10]_CITE and Zimmermann [14]_CITE, we derived the following property: Property 2If A =(a,b,c; ),B =(p,q,r; ) FN( ),1 FP,(10)(a,b,c; ) (p,q,r; )=(a+p,b+q,c+r; )(20)(a,b,c; ) (p,q,r; )=(a-r,b-q,c-p; )(30)1 (a,b,c; )=(1-c,1-b,1-a; )LetA L=(a1,b1,c1; ),B L=(p1,q1,r1; ) FN( ),A U=(a2,b1,c2; ),B U=(p2,q1,r2; ) FN( ),1 FP"
"Using the method proposed by Zimmermann [14]_CITE, we used Fig_4 approximate to Fig_3 to obtain A L B L (a1p1,b1q1,c1r1; ), similarly, A U B U (a2p2,b1q1,c2r2; )"
"Using Property 4(b), a=1- j=1n(1-Rj+ 2j),b=1- j=1nRj,c=1- j=1n(1-Rj- 3j),p=1- j=1n(1-Rj+ 1j) and r=1- j=1n(1-Rj- 4j) are positive numbers, and we can obtain the following 12d(1 [(1 R 1) (1 R 2) (1 R n)],0 )=116[6(1+ )b+a+c+(4-3 )p+(4-3 )r]>0,0 Example 1 is based on the example presented by Chen [7]_CITE and Singer [12]_CITE"

"In this work, the forest fire simulator selected is FARSITE [1]_CITE, because it has been extensively validated and is widely used throughout the firefighting community"
"So, overlapping domain decomposition [8]_CITE appears as a promising approach to solving such large systems since the mesh is divided into subdomains and the linear systems involved are consequently reduced [9,10]_CITE, implying a significant reduction in wind field calculation execution time"
"Successful implementations of home health care scheduling tools are described, eg, in Eveborn_et al._(2006_CITE, 2009)_CITE or Begur_et al._(1997)_CITE"
"An overview of home care routing and scheduling and related problems can be found in Castillo-Salazar,_Landa-Silva,_and_Qu_(2015)_CITE"
"We then design a metaheuristic solution framework that is based on multi-directional local search ( Tricoire,_2012_CITE) to solve instances of realistic size (see Section 4)"
"The algorithm is based on the multi-directional local search framework ( Tricoire,_2012_CITE) and uses large neighborhood search (LNS) as a subheuristic"
Large neighborhood search (LNS) is a metaheuristic which was first introduced by Shaw_(1998)_CITE
A successful general-purpose LNS algorithm for a variety of vehicle routing problems was proposed by Pisinger_and_Ropke_(2007)_CITE
An adaptive version of LNS is proposed by Ropke_and_Pisinger_(2006)_CITE in which the selection of the operators is biased using their success in previous iterations
"For details and an overview of recent developments on LNS, the reader is referred to Pisinger_and_Ropke_(2010)_CITE"
"Tricoire_(2012)_CITE shows that, using LNS as a subheuristic, the MDLS framework produces results which are competitive to those of the best known solution method for three general multi-objective optimization problems (multi-dimensional multi-objective knapsack problem, bi-objective set packing problem, bi-objective orienteering problem)"
"The structure of our MDLS algorithm is very similar to the structure described by Tricoire_(2012)_CITE, although in our case a single-objective local search procedure may result in more than one new solution as is discussed in Section 4.2"
"As in Shaw_(1998)_CITE and Ropke_and_Pisinger_(2006)_CITE, a parameter P 1 is used in all worst removal operators to introduce some randomness in the selection of jobs, thereby avoiding the same jobs to be removed over and over again"
"For a detailed discussion of these operators, the reader is referred to Ropke_and_Pisinger_(2006)_CITE and Pisinger_and_Ropke_(2007)_CITE"
"However, the parameter values that have been applied are based on both real-life data of two Viennese companies and real-life-based benchmark data for a related problem ( Hiermann_et al.,_2015_CITE)"
"To assess the quality of the proposed metaheuristic, Pareto-optimal solutions for small problem instances are generated by embedding the model described in Section 2.1 into the well-known -constraint scheme ( Laumanns,_Thiele,_&_Zitzler,_2006_CITE)"
"Local features, such as local Gabor binary patterns (LGBP) [3]_CITE and high-dimensional local binary patterns (LBP) [4]_CITE, are effective for face recognition"
"Recently, a joint Bayesian model trained from a large dataset of labeled faces was successfully used for face verification [6]_CITE"
"In Section 6, we apply the above algorithm to the FERET [23]_CITE database and present the experimental results"
"The Lucas Kanade algorithm [11]_CITE is effective for learning warps between poses, as shown in Fig_2."
"To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MVV AE, we compared it with the weighted LBP [21]_CITE, LGBP [3]_CITE, SIFT [20]_CITE, Affine-SIFT [22]_CITE, stack flow [11]_CITE, and OSS [16]_CITE"
"For example, in Rouane_et_al._(2004_CITE) there is an interesting discussion on attribute conflicts, but the authors do not address in detail how these problems are resolved"
In this research we use a pre-defined data dictionary developed in Fu_and_Cohn_(2008a)_CITE to disambiguate attributes
"The mapping and integration was carried out in a semi-automated manner, where data acquisition and attribute disambiguation were conducted manually, the open source tool Galicia ( Valtchev_et_al.,_2003_CITE) was employed for context manipulation and GSH generation, and all other processes such as information explication and conceptual scaling were completed with Java and SQL codes"
We employ the ontology measures proposed in Dellschaft_and_Staab_(2006_CITE) and Maedche_and_Staab_(2002_CITE) in our experiments
"To evaluate the quality of this integrated ontology ( FCA ontology for short), we compared it against a handcrafted ontology that was developed with a traditional knowledge engineering approach as described in Fu_and_Cohn_(2008a)_CITE ( KE ontology for short)"
"We evaluate the two ontologies in the similar fashion as done in ( Brewster,_Alani,_Dasmahapatra,_&_Wilks,_2004_CITE)"
A prominent example of a graph-based global importance metric is Google's page rank [34]_CITE
At least five to ten cells are required to ensure that the largest scales are well resolved in LES [20]_CITE
"The proposed method is based on the discriminative features extracted from skin probability maps, obtained using a conventional Bayesian classifier ( Jones_and_Rehg,_2002_CITE)"
"Here, we introduce the discriminative skin-presence features (DSPFs), derived from the discriminative textural features (DTFs) described in our earlier works on skin detection ( Kawulok,_2012_CITE) and image colorization ( Kawulok_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"For the spatial analysis we adapted an algorithm based on the distance transform in a combined domain (DTCD) of hue, luminance and skin probability, developed during our earlier study ( Kawulok,_2013_CITE)"
"The proposed method was compared with another approach proposed by Jiang_et_al._(2007)_CITE, who also exploit the textural features, which is followed by the spatial analysis"
A thorough survey comparing various color-based skin detection approaches was presented by Kakumanu_et_al._(2007)_CITE.
A technique operating in multiple color spaces to increase the stability was described by Kukharev_and_Nowosielski_(2004)_CITE
"An interesting algorithm incorporating color, texture and space analysis was given by Jiang_et_al._(2007)_CITE"
"In the presented study, the skin probability maps were obtained using Bayesian skin modeling introduced by Jones_and_Rehg_(2002)_CITE"
"Linear discriminant analysis ( Seber,_1984_CITE) is a supervised statistical feature extraction method frequently used in machine learning, and here it was applied to extract the discriminative textural features"
"In the research reported in this paper we used a spatial analysis method which we developed during our earlier works ( Kawulok,_2013_CITE)"
The minimization is performed using the Dijkstra algorithm as proposed by Ikonen_and_Toivanen_(2007)_CITE
"In addition, P threshold is used as proposed by del_Solar_and_Verschae_(2004)_CITE, which prevents the propagation to the regions of very low skin probability."
"The latter allows for better separation between the skin and non-skin pixels, resulting in lower detection errors, which was demonstrated in ( Kawulok,_2012_CITE)"
"We considered including other features like entropy or local binary patterns ( Ojala_et_al.,_2002_CITE) into the BIFs, as they are often used for texture segmentation, however it did not improve the results, whereas the computational costs were increased"
"First, for a given training set of images and associated skin masks, the probability look-up table is obtained using the Bayesian skin modeling ( Jones_and_Rehg,_2002_CITE)"
"The experiments were carried out for two data sets, namely: 4000 images from the ECU database ( Phung_et_al.,_2003_CITE), and 899 hand images (termed HGR) which we registered for the gesture recognition purposes (available at HYPERLINK mkawulok/gestures)"
"Furthermore, we compared the method with the Bayesian classifier ( Jones_and_Rehg,_2002_CITE), diffusion-based spatial analysis (DSA) introduced by del_Solar_and_Verschae_(2004)_CITE and our DTCD method performed in the skin probability maps obtained using the Bayesian classifier ( Kawulok,_2013_CITE)"
"In the case of the DTCD performed in the raw skin probability map, the threshold P was set to 0.6 for the ECU data set and to 0.4 for the HGR set as suggested in Kawulok_(2013)_CITE."
"The table also includes the comparison with the DTF method ( Kawulok,_2012_CITE)"
"Sensitivity analysis: We have implemented the approach as an extension to the EvoSuite tool ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2013b_CITE), and analyze the effects of the different parameters involved in the local search, and determine the best configuration."
"This paper is an extension of Fraser_et al._(2013)_CITE, and it is organized as follows: Section 2 presents relevant background to search-based testing, and the different types of search that may be applied, including local search and search using Genetic and Memetic Algorithms"
"A popular version of local search often used in test data generation is Korel's Alternating Variable Method ( Korel,_1990;_Ferguson_and_Korel,_1996_CITE)"
"The use of MAs for test generation was originally proposed by Wang_and_Jeng_(2006)_CITE in the context of test generation for procedural code, and has since then been applied in different domains, such as combinatorial testing ( Rodriguez-Tello_and_Torres-Jimenez,_2010_CITE)"
Search operators for string values have initially been proposed by Alshraideh_and_Bottaci_(2006)_CITE
"Floating point datatypes: for floating point variables ( float, double) we use the same approach as originally defined by Harman_and_McMinn_(2007)_CITE for handling floating point numbers with the AVM"
"For this we use the approach that EvoSuite successfully applied to combine search-based testing and dynamic symbolic execution ( Galeotti_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"Therefore, we chose classes already used in previous experiments ( Arcuri_and_Fraser,_2013_CITE), but excluded those on which EvoSuite trivially already achieves 100% coverage, as there was no scope for improvement with local search"
"To this end, beside classes taken from the case study in Arcuri_and_Fraser_(2013)_CITE, we also included four benchmark classes on integer and floating point calculations from the Roops 2 2HYPERLINK"
"First, we used the SF100 corpus of classes ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2012_CITE)"
"Therefore, we used the case study of the Carfast ( Park_et al.,_2012_CITE) test generation tool 3 3Available at: HYPERLINK, accessed June 2013"
"We also considered seeding from bytecode ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2012_CITE) as a further parameter to experiment with"
"To evaluate the statistical and practical differences among the different settings, we followed the guidelines by Arcuri_and_Briand_(2014)_CITE"
"In this paper, when we do this kind of analysis, we create rank tables, in a similar way as we did in previous work ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2013_CITE)"
"In this paper we have not to applied such corrections, for reasons discussed by Arcuri_and_Briand_(2014),_Perneger_(1998)_CITE and Nakagawa_(2004)_CITE, with which we are in agreement with."
"As described in Section 4.3, we use the adaptive methods introduced by Galeotti_et al._(2013)_CITE"
"However, the technique we applied in our experiments was simple, and there is potential for further improvements using more advanced parameter control techniques ( Eiben_et al.,_1999_CITE)"
Krombholz_et al._(2013)_CITE provides a survey of such techniques which we take as instructive in this regard
"From the roster pages we can extract the names of employees (using the Stanford NER tool ( Finkel_et al.,_2005_CITE))"
"A C5.0 decision tree from the C50 R implementation ( Kuhn_et al.,_2015_CITE) was evaluated on a 90:10 training/test split of the dataset using a cost matrix which penalised false positives."
"Using a method adopted from Gonzalez_et al._(2013)_CITE, we randomly sampled 1161 Google+ profiles from the network."
"This sampling process is designed to avoid biases in the dataset being used for evaluating this component of the system, and is more fully described by Edwards_et al._(2016)_CITE."
We base our time comparison of profiles on the work of Atig_et al._(2014)_CITE
"Writing style similarity can be highly useful in identifying individuals, and the authorship analysis literature contains many well-performing supervised solutions (eg Afroz_et al._(2014)_CITE)."
Another simple and straightforward approach by Daubney et al [41]_CITE was the sparse set of features for pose estimation in low-level motions
"A high-level introduction to the motivations for doing so are provided by Hardy_(1997_CITE), while Bishop_(2007_CITE) provides discussion around the thought processes involved in scoping a meaningful penetration test, and addresses topics such as goal setting, attacker knowledge, resources, and ethics"
"Yeo_(2013_CITE) provides a more detailed methodology for the reconnaissance and attack phases of a penetration test, which is largely linear, with a cyclical element where compromise leads to the requirement for further enumeration"
"Penetration testing is frequently cited within the vulnerability assessment requirements of ISO/IEC 15408-3:2008 ( British_Standards_Institution,_2009_CITE)."
"Once a set of features is chosen, we train and classify the data using three common supervised machine-learning classifiers Naive Bayes, a Bayesian network ( John_and_Langley,_1995_CITE), and a support vector machine (SVM) ( Cortes_and_Vapnik,_1995_CITE)."
"Due to the sparsity of triggering relations existing in network traffic, we leverage the customized cost matrices ( Elkan,_2001_CITE) to penalize missed relations during the training"
"Additionally, we adopt our approach on a DARPA dataset ( MIT_Lincoln_Laboratory_CITE)"
"In dataset III, the malicious requests are labeled based on the IDMEF alerts and audit logs ( MIT_Lincoln_Laboratory_CITE)"
"The conventional precision and recall measures ( Baeza-Yates_et al.,_1999_CITE) evaluate the classification accuracy of the positives (ie, the existence of triggering relations)"
The compositional rule of inference [1]_CITE offers an effective mechanism for performing fuzzy inference with dense rule bases
"Fortunately, using fuzzy rule interpolation (FRI) [3,4]_CITE, certain useful conclusions may still be obtained."
"As with a number of conventional FRI approaches, the approach in this work is developed following the principle of analogical reasoning [27]_CITE"
"Using the method in [33]_CITE, the similarity between these two fuzzy sets is 0.002"
"Further to the examples previously shown, the proposed approach has also been evaluated against further applications for decision support, by adapting UCI-MLR benchmark datasets [34]_CITE, including Yacht Hydrodynamics, Servo, Concrete Compressive Strength, and Housing."
"However, even though this idea has been successfully used in mathematics [14]_CITE, the challenge in the case of Physics is to make cut-elimination algorithms work with high-level calculi such as LK P."
"The idea of formalizing a problem as a theorem and in such a way that its solution is in the instances used for the quantified variables in the proof is the fundamental principle behind the logic programming paradigm of computation, of which Prolog [19]_CITE is the most prominent language"
"Therefore, they essentially adhere to the traditional Hilbert-style axiomatization approach, and hence they suffer the same drawbacks, which are nicely explained from a computational point of view in [7]_CITE"
"The computation time that was previously ignored now appears explicitly as the length of proofs [17]_CITE and theories can naturally evolve by the addition and transformation of proofs in the collection, with new concepts emerging by the introduction of cuts and definition inferences."
Another indication that AIT and proof theory fit well together is the natural relation between cut-introduction and Kolmogorov complexity [13]_CITE
"For this purpose, widely accepted by the distributed systems community, is the use of the Autonomic Computing (AC) paradigm [2]_CITE to endow distributed systems with self-management capacities, such as self-adaptation and self-optimizing."
"Variability is modelled at different abstraction levels, mostly using feature models (FM) [3]_CITE at the requirements level and UML profiles or Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) [4 6]_CITE at the architectural level"
"For the rest of steps, we follow the widely known MAPE-K loop [8]_CITE of the AC paradigm, where MAPE stands for Monitoring, Analysis, Plan and Execution and K stands for Knowledge"
"For this we use a GA called DAGAME [22]_CITE, optimized to be executed at runtime with scarce resources"
"Concretely, as shown in [23]_CITE, exact techniques can only be applied to small cases at the cost of a very high execution time"
"In this paper, we use the DAGAME algorithm that focuses on optimizing feature models configurations, to optimize the VSpecs tree, as it has proven to be efficient and produces nearly-optimal results [22]_CITE"
"According to the definition provided in [31]_CITE, an architectural element is quiescent if the following criteria are satisfied: 1"
"If we apply the concept of optimality [23]_CITE, which is defined by Guo et al as the ratio between the utility of the solution obtained using DAGAME and the utility of the optimal solution, obtained using the exact method, we can see that, in the worst case, the optimality of the solutions obtained using DAGAME is higher than 87.4%"
"However, as shown in [22]_CITE, it is very straightforward to modify DAGAME in order to include the ability to take into account the usage of distinct resources"
"Brataas et al have proved that, in the dynamic reconfiguration process, the most relevant task regarding execution time is the decision of the new configuration [30]_CITE"
"To this end, they extend the Rainbow framework [37]_CITE with a mechanism for predicting resource availability based on data gathered in the past"
"This is also the objective of [23]_CITE, but using genetic algorithms, being even faster than the previous one"
"There are ample excellent reviews and text books on this topic; for example, the two books one by Hand [4]_CITE and the other by Murphy [8]_CITE give adequate and accessible descriptions of the bulk of these approaches devised in recent (and not so recent) years."
"[10]_CITE (Chapters 6) for detailed technical and practical discussions expressing the kernel function as a finite series expansion (5)K(x,xi; )= m=1M m(x) m(xi),which renders the right hand side of Eq 4 (6)1 i=1N ji i=1NK(x,xi; ) ji=1 i=1N ji i=1N ji m=1M m(x) m(xi),with { m}m=1M being appropriate basis functions (not necessarily polynomials) defined in the feature space in which the pattern vectors x and x i reside."
"This dissimilarity measure d( x, x i) can be conveniently expressed as [4]_CITE (10)d(x,xi)=xTx 2xTxi+xiTxiIn passing, the AA kernel is basically a discrete analogue of an isotropic Gaussian kernel [17,18]_CITE."
"Note that in [15]_CITE the authors developed a more general version of max min algebra over arbitrary linearly ordered set, but we will not follow this generalization here."
"The development of max min convexity has been mostly inspired by new geometric techniques in max plus (tropical) linear algebra, like those developed in [1,6,7,16]_CITE"
"Zimmermann [28]_CITE, and it gained new impetus after the works of Cohen, Gaubert, Quadrat and Singer [5]_CITE, and Develin and Sturmfels [6]_CITE"
"See [20]_CITE for a survey of max min convexity that also includes some new results, in particular, colorful extensions of the max min Carath odory theorem, as well as some applications of the topological Radon theorem."
"Although our interest here is mostly theoretical, it is also motivated by the theory of fuzzy sets [27]_CITE, which has numerous applications in computer science and decision theory"
"Our approach is inspired by a geometric idea behind the notion the tropical rank [7]_CITE, that is, a tropically convex polytope can be represented as a union of conventionally convex sets, and its dimension can be defined as the greatest dimension of these convex sets"
"Therefore, similarly to the max plus case (see [21]_CITE, Remark 4.3) in Bd there are elementary segments in only 2d 1 directions"
"We now show that for A B(k,k) our notion of strong regularity is equivalent to the trapezoidal property, and hence it coincides with the strong regularity in max min algebra introduced in [2]_CITE"
"It follows, for instance, from Butkovi and Szabo [3,_Theorem_2]_CITE"
"We now conclude with the following observation, which is similar to [2,_Theorem_3]_CITE"
"(ii) (iii): For this we can exploit, eg, [2,_Theorem_3]_CITE"
"To find such a submatrix, that is, to verify that the equivalent conditions of Theorem 5.8 hold, we can apply the strongly polynomial algorithm of [2]_CITE"
In this paper we introduce the notion of dimension of a max min convex set and show that it is equivalent to a notion of matrix rank based on the strong regularity for the matrices in max min algebra [2]_CITE
"Since the max min convex combinations also appear as mixtures of possibilistic measures in the framework of Dubois and Prade's possibility theory [8]_CITE, this paper can be seen as a contribution towards the geometry of such mixtures"
"We present our experimental set-up and results on a dataset of 10 full-body actions that has been previously used to report recognition performance with manual segmentation for ground-truth labeling ( Parisi,_Weber,_&_Wermter,_2014,_2015_CITE)"
"To evaluate our system, we compared newly obtained results with recently reported results using hierarchical GWR-based recognition ( Parisi_et_al.,_2015_CITE)"
"Our action dataset is composed of 10 full-body actions performed by 13 subjects ( Parisi_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Similar to Parisi_et_al._(2015)_CITE, each network was trained for 500 epochs over the entire training set"
"Experimental results showed an average classification accuracy of 93.3%, comparing with the state-of-the-art results of 94% reported by Parisi_et_al._(2015)_CITE that required the manual segmentation of training samples for assigning ground-truth labels"
"This model was able to solve a simple mental rotation task of 2D visually-perceived objects in a simulated humanoid robot, the iCub ( Tikhanoff_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"In this study we propose a new neuro-robotic model of mental rotation that builds upon the prior model proposed in Seepanomwan_et al._(2013a,_2013b)_CITE and overcomes its limitations discussed above"
"Moreover, it employs a flexible decision making mechanism, based on biologically plausible models of decision making ( Bogacz,_Brown,_Moehlis,_Holmes,_&_Cohen,_2006;_Usher_&_McClelland,_2001_CITE), that reproduces an error rate that varies gradually with the difficulty of the mental rotation"
"The model is tested through the hardware iCub humanoid robot ( Metta,_Sandini,_Vernon,_Natale,_&_Nori,_2008;_Sandini,_Metta,_&_Vernon,_2007_CITE) alongside the iCub simulator ( Tikhanoff_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"A meta-review ( Zacks,_2008_CITE) summarises the main areas that several studies have found to play a relevant role ( Fig_1 )."
"This model (together with other analogous models, eg Bogacz_et al.,_2006_CITE) is very important, as it allows the reproduction of the reaction times often recorded in psychological experiments ( Caligiore_et al.,_2010,_2008;_Erlhagen_&_Sch ner,_2002_CITE)"
"It is one of the most accredited models of decision making processes taking place in the human brain ( Bogacz,_2007_CITE)."
"The robot was tested in a mental rotation task similar to those typically used in mental rotation experiments with humans (eg, Shepard_&_Metzler,_1971;_Wexler_et al.,_1998_CITE)"
"The training was based on an abstraction of motor babbling ( Caligiore_et al.,_2008_CITE), a process where random movements are exploited to acquire motor competencies"
"This rule exploits some of the mechanisms of the (unsupervised) Kohonen learning rule ( Kohonen,_2001_CITE) but is used in a supervised-learning fashion to ensure the acquisition of the link between images and their corresponding wrist orientations"
"First, starting from the approach followed in Caligiore_et al._(2010)_CITE, the model macro-architecture was constrained with knowledge on the areas of the human brain involved in mental rotation obtained with brain imaging studies and other neuroscientific studies suggesting the mechanisms operating within them"
"The work by Fahimnia_et_al._(2015)_CITE presents a review of quantitative and analytical models (ie mathematical, optimisation and simulation modelling efforts) for managing supply chain risks and points to generative research areas that have provided the field with foundational knowledge, concepts, theories, tools, and techniques"
"Examples of work of special relevancy here include Blackhurst_and_Wu_(2009),_Brandenburg,_Govindan,_Sarkis,_and_Seuring_(2014),_Heckmann,_Comes,_and_Nickel_(2015),_J ttner,_Peck,_and_Christopher_(2003),_Peck_(2006),_Tang_and_Zhou_(2012),_Zsidisin_(2003)_CITE and Zsidisin_and_Ritchie_(2010)_CITE"

"This set-up is discussed in more detail in Bjerga,_Aven,_and_Zio_(2014)_CITE."
"For a review of some alternative recent decision analytical approaches, see Gilboa_and_Marinacci_(2013)_CITE"
"A pioneering work was carried out by Klinke_and_Renn_(2002)_CITE, who offered a new classification of risk types and management strategies"
"The development and operation of policies are often structured by the following stages inspired by decision theory (eg Althaus,_Bridgman,_&_Davis,_2007_CITE): 1.Problem identification the recognition of an issue that demands further attention2.Generating alternatives, analysis3.Processing covering aspects like policy instrumentation development, consulting, deliberation and coordination4.Decision-making5.Implementation6.Evaluation (assessing the effectiveness of the policy)"
Roy_(2010)_CITE provides a review of research related to robustness
"Gabrel_et_al._(2014)_CITE present a review of recent developments in the field of robust optimisation, seeking to find the best policies when parameters are uncertain or ambiguous"
"Ben-Haim_(2012)_CITE provides some overall perspectives on tools and concepts of optimisation in decision-making, design, and planning, related to risk"
"There is a vast amount of literature (see eg Hopkins,_2014;_Le_Coze,_2013;_Weick,_Sutcliffe,_&_Obstfeld,_1999_CITE) providing arguments for organisations to organise their efforts in line with these principles in order to obtain high performance (high reliability) and effectively manage risks, the unforeseen and potential surprises."
Cox_(2012)_CITE reviews and discusses such approaches and methods to meet deep uncertainties
"See also Hamilton,_Lambert,_and_Valverde_(2015)_CITE."
Taleb_(2007)_CITE made the black swan metaphor well-known and it is widely used today
"His work has inspired many authors, also on foundational issues (eg, Aven,_2015a;_Chichilnisky,_2013;_Feduzi_&_Runde,_2014;_Masys,_2012_CITE), and recently there has been a lively discussion about the meaning of the black swan metaphor and its use in risk management; see Haugen_and_Vinnem_(2015)_CITE and Aven_(2015d,_2015e_CITE)"
Flage_and_Aven_(2015_CITE) perform an in-depth analysis of the emerging risk concept and in particular its relation to black swan type of events through the known/unknown
"To overcome these drawbacks, Herda et al [17]_CITE introduced a real-time method using an anatomical human model to predict the position of the markers"
"Inspired by [23]_CITE, our model also takes the low-rank structure property into account"
"In [23]_CITE, Lai et al simply modified the objective function of SVT [7]_CITE by imposing an inequality equation so that it is able to handle the mocap data de-noising problem"
"And inspired by the success of the penalized least squares regression model [14]_CITE, we seek to minimize the following objective function (11)L(x )= G1/2(x -x) 2+ R(x ),where R(x ) is a regularization term, is a scalar which determines the balance between the first fitting term and the second smoothing term, and G is a diagonal matrix such that Gi,i represents a weight assigned to the observed ith entry of x"
"In [33]_CITE, the authors have compared all of these algorithms and demonstrated that the ALM algorithm is much faster than the other methods and its precision is also higher [33]_CITE"
"For more details about the ALM algorithm, please refer to [33]_CITE"
"Because data from CMU dataset are very clean and complete [37]_CITE, we used them in the synthetic experiments"
"To evaluate the performance of our method, we compare it with the other four methods: Linear interpolation (Linear), Spline interpolation (Spline), Dynammo [30]_CITE and SVT [23]_CITE"
"SVT [23]_CITE and our method are much more suitable to handle long sequences (eg, boxing and tai chi sequences in Fig_7(k) and (i)) than short sequences (eg, run and walk sequences in Fig_7(a) and (b))."
Dynammo [30]_CITE works very well in handling periodic actions such as walking and running
"Relatively speaking, we find that Dynammo [30]_CITE offers the best performance for all the three motion sequences"
"Meanwhile, one can notice that our method takes up more time than SVT [23]_CITE in two human activities: boxing and basketball"
Section 3 introduces the theory based on the steps recommended by Sj berg_et_al._(2008)_CITE
"Stewart_(2001)_CITE describes the essential elements or assets that contribute to the development of intellectual capital as: Structural capital: Codified knowledge that can be transferred (eg, patents, processes, databases, and networks)"
Here it has been chosen to use the division of intellectual capital advocated by Youndt_et_al._(2004)_CITE for two main reasons
"Because, the capacity for effective software development in a unit is typically a function of both its internal linkage and its external linkage to other units and experts, we have adopted the view of Nahapiet_and_Ghoshal_(1998)_CITE, who describe the social capital as both internal and external to a unit."
"Some of the laws described by Endres_and_Rombach_(2003)_CITE are well established in both research and practice and others are not, and some of them can be turned into theories"
"Hoegl_and_Gemuenden's_(2001)_CITE frequently cited study, for example, shows the effect of TWQ on team performance and team members success for a set of traditional software development teams."
"Due to the lack of studies on the effect of TWQ in agile teams, we conducted a survey on this topic by replicating the study of Hoegl_and_Gemuenden_(2001)_CITE"
"This survey was a differentiated replication ( Lindsay_and_Ehrenberg,_1993_CITE)"
"The agile manifesto was not formulated before 2001, and the first book on Scrum was published in 2001 ( Schwaber_and_Beedle,_2001_CITE)"
"For more details, see Dahl_(2001)_CITE and Gassco_(2012)_CITE."
"We represent the production costs for these fields with a quadratic cost function based on a modification of the function provided by Golombek,_Gjelsvik,_and_Rosendahl_(1995)_CITE"
"For the production cost in the swing fields, we have based our parameters on Golombek,_Gjelsvik,_and_Rosendahl_(1998)_CITE and Kon-Kraft_(2003)_CITE."
"The market prices are represented by 10 outcomes that are generated with the moment-matching procedure described in H yland,_Kaut,_and_Wallace_(2003)_CITE"
"Testing our model framework on multiple sets of generated market price outcomes showed that 10 was a sufficient number of outcomes to achieve in-sample stability (Kaut,_Wallace,_Vladimirou,_and_Zenios,_2007)_CITE, with a standard deviation of 0.01 percent on the SP3 objective function value"
"Drawing below on social identity theory ( Tajfel_&_Turner,_1979_CITE), we demonstrate that identification with other forum users plays an influential role in both these processes."
"In one illustrative intervention study ( Hampton_&_Wellman,_2003_CITE), a suburb of Toronto had been turned into a wired suburb when residents were offered a package of online services, including high-speed internet access, videophone, online health advice, and local online discussion forums"
"This approach inspires us to draw a distinction between instrumental reasons for joining forums (eg, to seek information) and social reasons the two main reasons that have emerged in our preliminary research into this question ( Pendry,_Mewse,_&_Burgoyne,_2012_CITE)."
"Forum identification was assessed using Aron,_Aron,_and_Smollan s_(1992)_CITE Inclusion of Other in the Self (IOS) measure, adapted to measure ingroup identification (in line with the usage of Tropp_&_Wright,_2001_CITE)"
"This was measured using the five-item Satisfaction With Life scale (SWLS; Diener,_Emmons,_Larsen,_&_Griffin,_1985_CITE), designed to measure global cognitive judgments of one concept of life satisfaction"
"We used the procedure and SPSS macro written by Hayes_(2013)_CITE to compute not only the magnitude of the indirect effect but also percentile bootstrap confidence intervals (as recommended by Fritz,_Taylor,_&_MacKinnon,_2012_CITE) to assess whether identification serves as a mediator"
"Thus, according to both the Sobel test approach and the currently standard approach ( Preacher_&_Hayes,_2008_CITE), identification does indeed mediate the relationship between having one social expectations met/exceeded and the two outcomes of interest in this paper, supporting Hypothesis 5."
"Our approach is implemented utilizing the MOCell MOGA [21]_CITE, in which the population of individuals is arranged as a two-dimensional grid and an external archive is used to store the set of non-dominated solutions found so far"
Soft constraints have been implemented into the approach utilizing Constrained Pareto Dominance [10]_CITE as defined as the constraint handling procedure within the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGAII) [10]_CITE
Selection is performed via binary tournament (see [13]_CITE for more details) with single point crossover (with crossover probability 0.9) and bit flip mutation (with probability 0.01) employed (see [15]_CITE for discussions of crossover and mutation).

"The Reversed Compound Agent Theorem (RCAT) ( Harrison,_2003_CITE) is a generic framework to establish the existence and derivation of product-form solutions"
"In addition, we compared our solution method with current RCAT implementations, mainly AutoCAT ( Casale_and_Harrison,_2013_CITE) and INAP ( Balsamo_et al.,_2010a;_Marin_and_Bulo,_2009_CITE)"
The framework presented in the paper is closely related to the system proposed by Sirin et al [27]_CITE
ConGolog supports concurrency [12]_CITE and therefore can be used to create parallel workflows

"This model extraction is described in detail in our previous work ( van_Hoorn,_2014_CITE)"
"Once the component failure probabilities are updated in the model, we use Bayesian inference ( Bishop,_2006_CITE) to obtain the failure probabilities of all components"
"For the Bayesian network, we employ the Jayes library ( Kutschke,_2013_CITE)"
"The runtime measurements of the system, including application-level performance and execution traces, as well as resource utilization measurements, are collected by the Kieker monitoring framework ( van_Hoorn_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"For time series forecasting, the statistical library R ( R_Core_Team,_2015_CITE) is used"
"The described system is deployed on Emulab ( Hibler_et al.,_2008_CITE), which is a large-scale virtualized network testbed"
A complete list of metrics and detailed descriptions can be found in Salfner_et al._(2010)_CITE.
"Furthermore, to evaluate the significance of the improvement, we use two-sided hypothesis testing ( Wohlin_et al.,_2012_CITE) to compare the AUC with the following null and alternative hypotheses: H0:AUCHora=AUCMonolithicH1:AUCHora AUCMonolithicThe p-value is reported as the result of the test"
The method used in testing is introduced by DeLong_et al._(1988)_CITE to compare two or more AUCs
"The ROC curves, AUCs, and the results of the tests presented in Section 4.2 are generated using the pROC package ( Robin_et al.,_2011_CITE) available in R ( R_Core_Team,_2015_CITE)."
"In our evaluation, we consider three types of faults from real world incidents ( Pertet_and_Narasimhan,_2005_CITE), which are memory leak, system overload, and node crash"
"Therefore, we select an open-source application that is representative for the state-of-the-art enterprise systems, in terms of architectural style (microservice-based ( Newman,_2015_CITE)) and technology (NetflixOSS ecosystem)"
"Since covering all possible fault types is practically infeasible, we select three representative fault types from real world incidents based on Pertet_and_Narasimhan_(2005)_CITE"
Cheung_CITE proposes a seminal software reliability model that takes into account reliability of individual components along with the probability of calling other components
Albanese_et al._(2013)_CITE present a well-modeled formalism for complex inter-dependencies of missions as a set of tasks
Jakobson_(2011)_CITE presents a well-understood conceptual framework using interdependencies based on operational capacity at different abstraction layers
"This modeling approach is well accepted and can be found, eg, in Albanese_et al._(2013),_de_Barros_Barreto_et al._(2013),_Musman_et al._(2011)_CITE"
"Therefore, we extend a model by Jakobson_(2011)_CITE and model mission dependencies as shown in Fig_2 as a graph of mission nodes"
"To acquire the local CPD P(X|Y ) of node X from all its individual dependencies on nodes Y Y , we employ noisy-and and noisy-or combination functions, as, eg, described by Henrion in ( Henrion,_1988_CITE )."
"With Definition 3, a mission dependency model represents a probabilistic graphical model, and, in particular, a Bayesian network, as, eg, defined by Pearl_and_Russell_(2003)_CITE"
"Future work is dedicated to adapt existing approximation techniques, eg, Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering as presented in Doucet_et al._(2000)_CITE for DBNs toward novel ADBNs"
"Moreover, we discuss an extension of the presented approach toward dynamic mission impact assessments, providing a predictive and retrospect analysis of impacts over time, based on a novel dynamic probabilistic graphical model presented by Motzek_and_M ller_(2015a)_CITE"
"Recent work by Motzek_and_M ller_(2016)_CITE motivates that an automated response system can be reduced to a mathematical minimization of the expected mission impact in the presented models in a predictive and retrospect analysis over time in changing, dynamic environments."
String matching [1]_CITE is a widely known problem in Computer Science
The problem of order-preserving matching [2 6]_CITE has gained attention lately
"Our approach with sublinear filters was considerably faster than the algorithm by Cho et al [5]_CITE, which is the first sublinear solution of the problem."
All the algorithms were implemented in C in the 64-bit mode and run in the testing framework of Hume and Sunday [12]_CITE
Our solution based on filtration was compared with the BMH approach by Cho et al [5]_CITE (the authors generously let us use their implementation)
Cantone et al [15]_CITE developed a more sophisticated encoding with a faster filter.
"We have developed performance indices for case (i) in [2]_CITE, and analyzed one specific approach in case (ii) in [3]_CITE using almost sure Lyapunov exponents"
"The proof of Theorem 2.1 is given in [7]_CITE, Theorem 1 for the first part, and in [10]_CITE, Theorem 4.1 for the second part upon noticing that Conditions (3) and (7) together imply Conditions (A) and (C) in [10]_CITE"
In this section we present the application of the proposed methodology to the example of a power system consisting of one machine connected to a infinite bus; see [15]_CITE for more information regarding this model
An extensive overview is given in Long and Nelson [19]_CITE.
"The Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC), devised by Van de Weghe [26]_CITE, is a promising development towards this goal"
"To address this shortcoming, Van de Weghe [26]_CITE introduced the Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) to describe the relative motion of disconnected moving objects, providing an answer for many trajectory applications"
"For further explanation with respect to typical aspects of qualitative reasoning (eg dominance space, conceptual neighborhood diagrams, composition tables), we refer to Van de Weghe [26]_CITE"
We utilize a micro-GPS derived dataset of pigeon flights from a recent paper published in Nature [22]_CITE
"Since this study was launched after the summer vacation for German college students and slightly after the launch date of iPhone 6 (Sep 19th, 2014), we adopted two realistic scenarios based on the findings of Krasnova_et_al._(2013)_CITE: one involved reading a post from a Facebook friend who posted a vacation picture, and, the other scenario involved a picture of a newly bought iPhone 6"
"The Rayleigh distribution has a PDF given by [12]_CITE: (1)pRayr=r 2exp-r22 20 r 0r<0,where r is the envelope amplitude of the received signal, is the rms value and 2 is the time-average power of the received signal before envelope detection"
"For the Rayleigh distribution the Mean can be obtained by [13,12]_CITE: (2)rmean=E[r]= 0 rp(r)dr= 2=1.2533 ,and the Mean Squared value by: (3)E[r2]= 0 r2p(r)dr=2 2,therefore, (4) 2=Er22.The Rayleigh PDF with respect to the instantaneous Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)( ) is obtained by [13,14]_CITE: (5)pRayr=1 exp- 0 r 0r<0.When a dominant non-fading signal component is present, such as LOS propagation path, the small-scale fading envelope is described by Rician fading distribution"
"The Rician is given by [12]_CITE: (6)pRicr=r 2exp-r2+A22 2IoAr 20 r 0r<0,where A denotes the peak amplitude of the dominant signal and Io ( ) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind and zero-order"
"Comparison of model predictions with behavioral evidence, goodness of fit , is the most widespread quantitative method of evaluating, judging and comparing cognitive models ( Pitt_et al.,_2002_CITE)"
"See Burgess_(2008)_CITE and Moser_et al._(2008)_CITE for more comprehensive reviews of spatial cognition in the brain, and Kravitz,_Saleem,_Baker,_and_Mishkin_(2011)_CITE for an overview of areas associated with visuospatial processing."
"There is no well-established neural correlate of possible topological representations in the brain; although computational models with topological assumptions have successfully accounted for some hippocampal experimental data ( Chen,_Kloosterman,_Brown,_&_Wilson,_2012;_Dabaghian,_Cohn,_&_Frank,_2011_CITE) (and there is some neural evidence for the involvement of posterior parietal cortex (PPC) Calton_&_Taube,_2009_CITE and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) Epstein,_2008_CITE)."
"(See Kravitz_et al.,_2011_CITE for a detailed review of visuospatial processing in the brain.)"
"It has been argued that mathematically derived solutions to RL can plausibly be implemented in brains, based on the reward-relevant brain areas listed in the previous section (explaining RL and its correspondence to brains would exceed the scope of this paper; see Maia,_2009_CITE for an explanation and review of evidence)"
"Clarification of the following properties is also important in characterizing computational models of spatial memory (partially based on O Reilly,_1998_CITE and Webb,_2001_CITE 3 3Criteria specific to neuroscience and unimportant for characterizing purely cognitive models have been excluded.)"
"The spatial memory models reviewed in this section are divided into three categories, inspired by major modeling paradigms in the field of computational psychology ( Sun,_2008a_CITE)"
"The section symbolic spatial memory models describes models emphasizing explicit rules and localist representations based on symbolic logic ( Bringsjord,_2008_CITE)"
"(later extended in simulation as the BVC model by Barry_et al.,_2006_CITE)"
"One of the earliest definitions of such symbolic models has been put forth by Newell_and_Simon_(1976)_CITE, coining the term of a physical symbol system , a class of systems having symbols, being capable of manipulating them, and being realizable within our physical universe."
"There is evidence that spatial cues might be integrated statistically optimally in humans ( Nardini,_Jones,_Bedford,_&_Braddick,_2008_CITE) and animals ( Cheng,_Shettleworth,_Huttenlocher,_&_Rieser,_2007_CITE) on the behavioral level"
Building on work by Yeap_(1988)_CITE one of the first symbolic computational models of cognitive maps a number of robotic systems have been built (many of which have departed from the original claim of being computational theories of cognitive maps and will therefore be omitted)
"The idea of separate local and global representations is consistent with most empirical cognitive science research ( Hirtle_&_Jonides,_1985_CITE; Poucet,_1993_CITE; although there is some debate regarding whether and which mechanisms/areas are metric or topological)"
"In contrast to the previously described model, the robot by Jefferies_et al._(2008)_CITE used laser rangefinders as sensors (which provide more accuracy and resolution than simple sonar sensors)."
"This model is one of only two reviewed models capable of building a global map and of loop closing (the other being Beeson_et al.,_2010_CITE see below)."
"One of the first symbolic models of spatial memory in urban environments, growing out of the symbolic AI paradigm of the last century, was the NAVIGATOR model by Gopal,_Klatzky,_and_Smith_(1989)_CITE, implemented in LISP"
"Brom_et al._(2012)_CITE successfully replicate human data from two pointing paradigm experiments previously performed using their model, experiment 7 of Holmes_and_Sholl_(2005)_CITE, in which subjects learned the locations of objects in a room and then had to point to the remembered locations of the objects with their eyes closed after a 45 rotation left or right (both in an oriented and in a disoriented condition induced by slow rotation on a swiveling chair), and experiment 1 of Waller_and_Hodgson_(2006)_CITE, a similar pointing paradigm."
"Later extensions of the model which however have not been implemented on a real-world system include comparison to empirical data, electrophysiological data recorded from rats as well as human behavior data ( Barry_et al.,_2006_CITE) (the model could successfully account for the effect of changed environment size on both the firing fields of rat place cells and on object locations remembered by humans)."
"It succeeded in reproducing the empirically observed hierarchical cognitive maps by Hirtle_and_Jonides_(1985)_CITE, and also produced similar distance judgment errors as humans (distances spanning multiple clusters or submaps are overestimated both by humans and by the model)."
"The map-based path integrator (MPI) model by McNaughton_et al._(1996)_CITE was an influential and still highly relevant model of spatial representation and path integration in brains, implemented as a SNN"
"Another influential model was the BBB model proposed by Byrne_et al._(2007)_CITE and based on the BVC model ( Barry_et al.,_2006_CITE) (the predecessor of which was implemented on a robot, and reviewed in the previous subsection; Burgess_et al.,_2000_CITE)"
"More comprehensive reviews can be found in Duch,_Oentaryo,_and_Pasquier_(2008)_CITE, Goertzel,_Lian,_Arel,_de_Garis,_and_Chen_(2010)_CITE and Samsonovich_(2010)_CITE."
"The popular ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought Rational) cognitive architecture by Anderson,_Matessa,_and_Lebiere_(1997)_CITE follows a production-rule based approach (productions consist of sensory preconditions or IF statements, and associated actions or THEN statements executed when the precondition matches the state of the world)"
"CLARION has succeeded in modeling human behavior data from a large number of paradigms including the above mentioned minefield navigation task and thus can be called cognitively plausible ( Sun_&_Zhang,_2004_CITE)."
"The model by Barrera_et al._(2011)_CITE is notable because although it cannot close the loop and cannot perform global mapping, it can learn a real-world maze with a learning curve similar to rats, using a model that is highly structurally similar to rat brains."
"However, none of these models have evaluated their transformation mechanism against empirical data, with the exception of the neural network model by Byrne_et al._(2007)_CITE (which seems to predict heavily coordinated and correlated activity in the neural correlates of transformation, ie the RSC; but such activity has been not observed)."
"The BVC model ( Barry_et al.,_2006_CITE) is an example computational model successfully predicting the firing activity of spatially relevant neurons in single-unit recordings."
"ACT-R major modules have been mapped to brain areas (such as the imaginal module to the posterior parietal region, or the central pattern matcher to the basal ganglia), and a suitable mapping function has been devised that converts activity in these modules into activation patterns resembling fMRI data ( Qin_et al.,_2007_CITE), and more recently, EEG data ( Motomura,_Ojima,_&_Zhong,_2009_CITE), successfully predicting brain activity in novel circumstances ( Anderson_et al.,_2008_CITE)."
More information on graphical methods for classifier performance assessment can be found in [32]_CITE.
"The interested reader can consult, for instance, the work of Domingos [10]_CITE for more information on the issues related to bias and variance."
"For this reason, in the literature, some proposals have been made to introduce unbiased measures see in particular the work of Flach [16]_CITE."
"Franco_and_Meadows_(2007)_CITE indicated that McGrath's_(1984)_CITE circumplex is the most accepted framework for group decision support, theory, and research"
"Following Landsman_and_Stremersch_(2011)_CITE, we investigated multi-homing by dividing it into two levels: seller- and platform-level multi-homing"
"We used Levenshtein distance ( Levenshtein,_1966_CITE) to measure the similarity of two names and employed Python's difflib library 3 3Python v2.7.3"
"When examining multi-homing at the level of the whole content of the three ecosystems, our findings support Sun_and_Tse's_(2009_CITE) assertion that the market would evolve into one dominant ecosystem."
Dixon and Coles [8]_CITE were the first to evaluate the strength of football teams for the purpose of generating profit against published market odds with the use of a time-dependent Poisson regression model based on Maher [26]_CITE model
"However, Constantinou and Fenton [5]_CITE later developed a novel rating technique (called pi-rating) that outperformed considerably the two ELO rating variants of [21]_CITE, in terms of profitability, over a period of five EPL season."
"Forecasts were published online [29]_CITE prior to the start of each match, and this was the first academic study to demonstrate profitability that was consistent against published market odds over a sufficiently high number of betting trials without eliminating the bookmakers profit margin."
"In this paper we present a Bayesian network model for forecasting football outcomes that is based on the approach in [7]_CITE, but with reduced complexity and higher forecasting capability (which we explain in detail in Sections 2 4)"
As in [7]_CITE we have used the AgenaRisk Bayesian network tool to build the model
"To examine genre and ways of perceiving, we used specific eye movement behavior metrics or ocular metrics ( Rayner,_1998_CITE) which have been in fairly common use in contemporary eye tracking experiments ie Scanpath Duration and Scanpath Length, c.f"
"More discussion of the definitions can be read in Clark,_Ruthven,_&_Holt_(2009a,_pp._3 6)_CITE"
"Lorigo_et_al._(2006)_CITE, in an extension of the work in Pan_et_al._(2004)_CITE, used scanpath fixations pattern-finding to compare the differences in gender and task type during a web search"
"After reviewing the very comprehensive and popular eyetracking scanpaths metrics in Goldberg_&_Kotval_(1999),_Goldberg_et_al._(2002),_Salvucci_&_Goldberg_(2000),_&_Poole_&_J_Ball_(2005)_CITE and comparing with the research questions and aims of the evaluation we decided on the two metrics: scanpath duration Fig_5 and scanpath length Fig_6 which also complemented our previous work"
"Skimming and scanning: The techniques were detected using the methodology employed in Campbell_&_Maglio_(2001,_p._3)_CITE and Buscher,_Dengel,_van_Elst,_and_Mittag_(2008)_CITE, with some modifications"
"Just like Watt_(2009,_chap._8)_CITE in his timed response design we balanced for length and still found a very strong effect (an interaction between layout representations) which indicated that genre speed was a factor independent of length, as in Clark,_Ruthven,_&_Holt_(2009b)_and_Clark_et_al._(2010)_CITE"
"This work is a continuation of the previous pilot studies conducted by Toms_and_Campbell_(1999b)_CITE and the later study carried out by Watt_(2009,_chap._8)_CITE on the findings of Toms and Campbell, to examine the importance of form and purpose (or function, which Toms and Campbell referred to as being synonymous with content) in communities of practice, but with the inclusion of more data"
"However, since the prioneering work of Lord et al [72]_CITE, the proposal of similarity measures for genomics and proteomics based on the Gene Ontology (GO) [5]_CITE have attracted a lot of attention, as detailed in a recent survey on the topic [76]_CITE"
"In [57]_CITE, Lastra-D az and Garc a-Serrano introduce a new family of similarity measures based on an Information Content (IC) model, whose pioneering work is introduced by Resnik [108]_CITE"
"Their new familiy of semantic similarity measures is based on two unexplored notions: a non-linear normalization of the classic Jiang-Conrath distance [52]_CITE, and a generalization of this latter distance on non tree-like taxonomies defined as the length of the shortest path within an IC-weigthed taxonomy"
"One of the similarity measures introduced in [57]_CITE, called coswJ&Csim, obtains the best results on the RG65 dataset"
"This latter family of IC models is refined in another subsequent paper [58]_CITE, which also sets out the new state of the art and confirms the outperformance of the coswJ&Csim similarity measure in a statistically significant manner among the family of ontology-based semantic similarity measures based on WordNet."
"The main aim of this work is to introduce the PosetHERep representation model and make the Half-Edge Semantic Measures Library (HESML ) publicly available for the first time, together with a set of reproducible experiments whose aims are the exact replication of the three aforementioned experimental surveys [56 58]_CITE, as well as the proposal for a self-contained experimental platform which can be easily used for extensive experimentation, even with no software coding"
"In addition, this work also introduces a new replication framework and the WNSimRep v1 dataset for the first time provided as supplementary material in [63]_CITE, whose aim is to provide a gold standard to assist in the exact replication of ontology-based similarity measures and IC models"
"Finally, we have carried-out a series of experiments in order to evaluate the scalability and peformance of HESML as regards the Semantic Measures Library (SML) [48]_CITE and WNetSS [15]_CITE, which sets out the current state of the art"
"This work is part of a novel innitiative on computational reproducibility recently introduced by Chirigati et al [26]_CITE, whose pioneering work is introduced by Wolke et al [127]_CITE with the aim of leading to the exact replication of several dynamic resource allocation strategies in cloud data centers evaluated in a companion paper [128]_CITE."
Section 4 introduces a set of reproducible experiments as a companion work to the aforementioned works introduced by Lastra-D az and Garc a-Serrano [56 58]_CITE
"Section 5 briefly introduces the WNSimRep v1 dataset, which is detailed and made publicly available in [63]_CITE as complementary material"
"However, for an in-depth review of the latter topics, we refer the reader to the reviews by Lastra-D az and Garc a-Serrano on IC-based similarity measures [57]_CITE and IC models [56,58]_CITE, as well as the short review by Batet and S nchez [12]_CITE and the book by Harispe et al [49]_CITE."
"First, edge-counting measures, the so-called path-based measures, whose core idea is the use of the length of the shortest path between concepts as an estimation of their degree of similarity, such as the pioneering work of Rada et al [107]_CITE"
"Second, the family of IC-based similarity measures, whose core idea is the use of an Information Content (IC) model, such as the pioneering work of Resnik [108]_CITE, and the subsequent measures introduced by Jiang and Conrath [52]_CITE and Lin [70]_CITE"
"Third, the familiy of feature-based similarity measures, whose core idea is the use of set-theory operators between the feature sets of the concepts, such as the pioneering work of Tversky [124]_CITE"
"And fourth, other similarity measures that cannot be directly categorized into any previous family, which are based on similarity graphs derived from WordNet [122]_CITE, novel contributions of the hyponym set [43]_CITE, or aggregations of other measures [75]_CITE."
"The first known IC model is based on corpus statistics and was introduced by Resnik [108]_CITE, and subsequently detailed in [109]_CITE"
"To bridge this gap, Seco et al [119]_CITE introduce the first intrinsic IC model in the literature, whose core hypothesis is that the IC models can be directly computed from intrinsic taxonomical features"
"Among the main intrinsic and corpus-based IC models proposed in the literature, we find the proposals by Zhou et al [133]_CITE, Sebti and Barfroush [118]_CITE, Blanchard et al [18]_CITE, S nchez et al [114]_CITE [113]_CITE, Meng et al [82]_CITE, Yuan et al [131]_CITE, Hadj Taieb et al [42]_CITE, Lastra-D az and Garc a-Serrano [56,58]_CITE, Adhikari et al [1]_CITE, Aouicha et al [4,16]_CITE, and Harispe et al [46]_CITE."
"Finally, in another recent work, Jiang et al [53]_CITE introduce a new intrinsic IC model based on the Wikipedia category structure which has obtained outstanding results in several word-similarity benchmarks"
"The main publicly available software libraries focusing on the implementation of ontology-based similarity measures based on WordNet areWordNet::Similarity (WNSim) [99]_CITE and WS4J [121]_CITE, whose development is more stable, and the Semantic Measures Library (SML) [47]_CITE and the recent WNetSS [15]_CITE which are active ongoing projects."
"The pioneering WNSim library was developed in Perl by Pedersen et al [99]_CITE, and subsequently migrated to Java by Tedeki Shima, under the name of WS4J [121]_CITE"
"On the other hand, Harispe et al [47]_CITE introduce the aforementioned SML library, which is the largest semantic measures library"
"In order to make the experimental work with HESML easier, as well as supporting the reproducible experiments detailed in section 4, HESML is distributed as a self-contained development and testing platform including the set of complementary resources shown in table 22 in appendix, which includes three different WordNet 3 3HYPERLINK versions, a WordNet-based frequency file dataset developed by Ted Pedersen [95]_CITE, and the five most significant word similarity benchmarks"
"The method is a classic Dijkstra algorithm based on a min-priority queue [25,79]_CITE and the aforementioned PosetHERep vertex iteration loop in order to efficiently traverse the graph"
"We follow the same experimental setup as that detailed in [56]_CITE and [58]_CITE, including the same datasets, preprocessing steps, evaluation metrics, baselines, management of polysemic words and reporting of the results"
"For a comparison of these two types of virtualization platform, we refer the reader to the survey introduced by Merkel [84]_CITE, in which the author introduces Docker and compares it with classic Virtual Machines (VM) such as VirtualBox."
"Finally, table 16 summarizes the software platforms in which the reproducible experiments [64]_CITE have been successfully reproduced."
"The WNSimRep v1 dataset is part of the experimental data reported in our three aforementioned works [56 58]_CITE, and it was automatically generated using HESML as detailed in section 4.3.1."
"WNSimRep v1 includes three different types of data files: (1) node-valued IC data files with taxonomical features, (2) edge-valued IC data files with the conditional probability between child and parent concepts, and (3) synset-pair-valued data files with taxonomical features and IC-based similarity measures for the synset pairs derived from the classic RG65 benchmark introduced by [111]_CITE"
"The concept of loss aversion is also well documented within the psychology literature [20]_CITE, with individuals motivated to avoid potential losses in the future"
"As such, the findings of Vishwanath et al [41]_CITE, whereby the presence of urgency cues monopolised attentional resources also appears to differentially apply to other influence techniques (ie, authority) and be impacted to a degree, although not entirely, by the availability of cognitive resource"
"As a result, decision support systems that reduce the impact of these heuristic processes via user-centred design would benefit from further development (eg, [33]_CITE)"
"First, we consider the algorithmic level and use a speech database to assess the usefulness of OT features as compared to standard features used in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) that are based on cepstral coefficients ( Rabiner_&_Juang,_1993_CITE)"
"Second, we propose a more generic model of transient synchronization based on a Weakly Coupled Oscillator (WCO) framework ( Hoppensteadt_&_Izhikevich,_1997_CITE)"
"WCOs are a standard approach for studying synchronization dynamics ( Hoppensteadt_&_Izhikevich,_1997_CITE) and can be derived by applying a phase reduction approach to neurophysiologically realistic neural ( Gutkin,_Ermentrout,_&_Reyes,_2005_CITE) or neural network ( Brown,_Moehlis,_&_Holmes,_2004_CITE) models"
"This is based on previous work ( Canolty_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
"There has since been a large amount of work in this area with reviews focusing on its role in large-scale integration ( Varela,_Lachaux,_Rodriguez,_&_Martinerie,_2001_CITE), enhanced communication ( Fries,_2005_CITE), attention and memory ( Jensen,_Kaiser,_&_Lachaux,_2007_CITE) and spike-timing dependent plasticity ( Buzsaki,_2006_CITE)"
"This extends previous findings from fMRI ( Binder_et al.,_2000_CITE) and provides evidence for a degree of seriality in word processing"
"These factors are described in a recent comprehensive review ( Wang,_2010_CITE)"
"Mathematical studies of coupled oscillators show that for fast interactions, synchronization is most readily achieved using excitatory connections ( Vreeswijk,_Abbott,_&_Ermentrout,_1994_CITE)"
Further details of the MTF processing are given in Canolty_et al._(2007)_CITE
Fig_3 demonstrates the same concept as Fig_2 in Hopfield_and_Brody_(2001)_CITE but uses a WCO rather than IF network
This is discussed at length in Hopfield_and_Brody_(2001)_CITE and illustrated in Fig_5
"These were based on previous models of visual attention ( Niebur_&_Koch,_1994_CITE) and image segmentation ( Wang_&_Terman,_1997_CITE) that also made use of synchronizing dynamics."
"The instantaneous field power is then given by ( Roweis,_2009_CITE) (6) y(x,t)2 =1+e t2(K 1)"
"(3)) using the Euler Maruyama method ( Kloeden_&_Platen,_1999_CITE) to compute the phase time series for the network of oscillators, k, and then use Eq (5) to produce the field response"
"The posterior density was then estimated using a Metropolis Hastings (MH) algorithm ( Gelman,_Carlin,_Stern,_&_Rubin,_1995_CITE)"
"MFCCs form the front-end of state-of- the-art speech recognition systems such as HTK ( Woodland,_2003_CITE) and Sphinx-4 ( Walker,_Lamere,_Kwok,_Raj,_&_Singh,_2004_CITE)"
"To simplify the comparison of MFCC and OT features they were both fed into an identical pattern recognition stage, chosen to be a first nearest neighbour classifier ( Duda_&_Hart,_1973_CITE)."
"We used the multiple speaker isolated word database described in Hopfield_and_Brody_(2000,_2001)_CITE"
"This data is a subset of the TI46 database from the Linguistic Data Consortium ( Verstraeten,_Schrauwen,_Stroobandt,_&_Campenhout,_2005_CITE)"
"We then improved the system by introducing multiple level detectors for each onset and offset feature, as proposed in Gutig_and_Sompolinsky_(2009)_CITE"
"MFCC features are much more powerful when used in combination with an HMM classifier ( Woodland,_2003_CITE), and OT features when used with a recognition process such as a Tempotron ( Gutig_&_Sompolinsky,_2009_CITE)"
This work is based heavily on prior developments by Hopfield_and_Brody_(2001)_CITE and we have made three novel contributions to the literature.
"Our results are more in line with those of Rouat,_Loiselle,_and_Molotchnikoff_(2011)_CITE who obtained word error rates of 78% when training an MFCC HMM system on clean utterances and testing it on 10 dB noisy utterances using noise samples from Aurora-2."
"Extension of our modelling to include multiple regions, as in Corchs_and_Deco_(2004);_Husain_et al._(2004)_CITE, is therefore an important direction for future work."
"The MFCCs were derived using a standard data processing pipeline ( Gutig_&_Sompolinsky,_2009_CITE)"
"One successful example of this type of commoditization in computational chemistry is the Plumed [9]_CITE package that integrates with a number of different molecular dynamics packages for free energy sampling, which has enabled a number of teams to scale molecular dynamics to very large resources [10,11]_CITE."

Our formalization improves on the certifier for tree automata completion by Boyer et al [2]_CITE in that we can handle non-left-linear systems.
"To demonstrate this, we provide examples where the techniques of [12,13,19]_CITE are successfully applied when state-compatible automata are used, but where the techniques must fail if they are restricted to use the compatibility criteria of Genet or Korp and Middeldorp"
"Following [13]_CITE, we formulate Genet's result from [7]_CITE as follows:"
"To overcome this problem, Korp and Middeldorp introduced quasi-deterministic automata [13]_CITE (cf"
"Using [3,_Exercise_1.12.2]_CITE, which shows that it is NP-hard to decide whether an instance of a term l is accepted by a tree automaton A, we can show that deciding whether the language accepted by a deterministic automaton is closed under rewriting by a given TRS is co-NP-hard"
"To this end, we need the following key lemma, a slight generalization of [13,_Lemma_20]_CITE, which shows that a quasi-deterministic automaton A is almost deterministic: all but the last step in a reduction can be performed using the deterministic d transitions"
"The proof is identical to the proof of [13,_Lemma_20]_CITE, except when ti in t=f(t1, ,tn) is a state"
"To overcome this problem, we follow [13]_CITE and consider a special rewrite relation which allows to adjust labels for matching non-left-linear rules"
"On the analyzer side we have extended the termination tool Image 1 [11]_CITE and the confluence tool CSI [19]_CITE to produce state-coherent, state-compatible automata"
"In fact, for some algorithms we just relied on the automatic refinement provided in [16]_CITE which turns set operations into operations on trees"

A great deal of works has been carried out on various aspects of fluid flow and heat transfer over a stretching sheet since the pioneering work of Sakiadis [1]_CITE and Crane [2]_CITE
"The main model used in this paper is Petri nets [25,26]_CITE as they provide a framework in which both state-based and action-based system information is represented explicitly, and also because they had been extensively used in the past to treat persistence and nonviolence"
"A part of the technical development will be formulated in terms of more general transition systems [17]_CITE which provide a semantical link between Petri nets and other concurrency models, eg, process calculi."
We follow the basic variant of the step sequence approach often referred to as the single-server semantics [15]_CITE where steps are sets of executed actions
"Moreover, in the context of Petri nets with time, the single-server semantics means that a single clock is assigned to an action and, as argued in [15]_CITE, such an approach has been used most widely for modelling real-time concurrent computing systems"
"There are several structurally defined and extensively applied persistent sub-classes of Petri nets, including choice-free nets [14,30]_CITE, marked graphs [8]_CITE, and MTS nets [5,16,22]_CITE demonstrated that persistence (together with other properties) guarantees separability which means that a Petri net can be seen and verified as a composition of finitely many concurrently operating independent copies of much simpler net [6,7]_CITE presented a way in which persistent nets can be synthesised and re-engineered from finite transition systems."
The original motivation for the work presented here came from a challenge to deal with the design of asynchronous circuits [10]_CITE
"An attractive compromise turns out to be mixed synchronous-asynchronous GALS design [29]_CITE, where a digital system is divided into hazard-free synchronous islands communicating asynchronously using potentially hazardous handshake mechanism."
An alternative proof of Proposition 8.1 can be found in [13]_CITE (stated there as Proposition 4.6).
"In the first part of this paper, we extended and revised the taxonomy of nonviolent and persistent steps and markings proposed in [18]_CITE"
"However, considering that the first academic articles discussing analytics were published in the early 2000s (eg Kohavi,_Rothleder,_&_Simoudis_(2002)_CITE), the tardiness of the OR/MS academic community response is surprising enough to warrant further exploration of the underlying causes."
"Perhaps the most cited definition of analytics is that provided by Davenport_and_Harris_(2007,_p._7)_CITE: [T]he extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models, and fact-based management to drive decisions and actions"
"The most prevalent of such definitions is proposed in Lustig,_Dietrich,_Johnson,_and_Dziekan_(2010)_CITE, who argue that analytics comprises of three distinct aspects: Descriptive analytics: statistical methods designed to explore what happened? Predictive analytics: machine learning methods designed to predict what will happen next? Prescriptive analytics: OR/MS methods designed to answer what should the business do next?"
"In Decision Support Systems, arguably the area most influential book of its era, Keen_and_Scott_Morton_(1978,_pp._33 34)_CITE propose that four disciplines are integral: computer science, information economics, management science and behavioral science"
"However, in its modern-day counterpart, Competing on Analytics ( Davenport_&_Harris,_2007_CITE), there are only two direct mention of OR/MS, but a total of 59 mentions of the terms statistics and statistical"
"World War Two was a period of significant innovation, most famously in Bletchley Park where Colossus, the first programmable digital computer, and decryption machines (such as Alan Turing Bombe) were created ( Flowers,_1983;_Randell,_1972_CITE)"
"Similarly the work of Edward Tizard, Patrick Blackett and the Aeronautical Research Committee, arguably the originators of the OR/MS discipline, played a significant influence on Britain war effort ( Kirby,_2003;_Ormerod,_1999_CITE), as well as many of the quantitative methods of the dianoetic management paradigm"
"In Germany Konrad Zuse created the Z1 (the first digital computer) predating Colossus by two years ( Giloi,_1998_CITE), whilst mathematics became increasingly important in military operations of the US ( Rees,_1980_CITE) and Canada ( Laporte,_2008_CITE)."
"Arguably it was the latter of these which had the greatest public impact by successfully predicting the 1952 US presidential election ( Ceruzzi,_1999_CITE)"
"The decision making aspect of the paradigm also came to prominence, with research conducted at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and MIT, and publications from Simon_(1965)_and_Anthony_(1965)_CITE particularly influential ( Power,_2007_CITE)"
"Alongside this more general work into the interface between man-and-machine , notable research was published by Scott_Morton_(1969)_and_Ferguson_and_Jones_(1969)_CITE into how practical system can be devised that would better support decision making."
"Elsewhere, attempts were made to create solutions to wicked problems ( Churchman,_1967_CITE); problems which are harder to structure and define due to conflicting perspectives amongst relevant stakeholders"
"In particular, US consumer goods giant Proctor &#38; Gamble, in conjunction with Metaphor Computer Systems, were instrumental in demonstrating the value and the methodology of a new form of architecture ( Nylund,_1999_CITE)"
The use of such metrics as management tools had become popularised by Kaplan_and_Norton s_(1992)_CITE balanced scorecard
"In business, the term is first used around 2000 (eg Whiting,_2000_CITE), and in the context of BI software"
"Secondly, there have been many efforts to provide decision support and automation in real-time (eg Davenport_&_Harris,_2007;_Niedermann,_Radesch tz,_&_Mitschang,_2011_CITE)"
"Methods such as simulation have long utilised graphical displays for these purposes ( Hurrion,_1976_CITE) and whilst there has been research into their design and use (eg Belton_&_Elder,_1994_CITE), further studies into best practices, in particular with respect to recent visualisation work should be encouraged"
"In the OR literature the Viable Systems Model (VSM) ( Beer,_1972,_1979_CITE, 1985_CITE) has been frequently used as a lens to explore this type of adaptive organisational complexity in a variety of contexts such as: national innovation ( Devine,_2005_CITE); public sector planning ( Clemens,_2009_CITE); virtual enterprises ( Assimakopoulos_&_Dimitriou,_2006_CITE); environmental sustainability ( Espinosa,_Harnden,_&_Walker,_2008_CITE); purchasing ( Azadeh,_Darivandi,_&_Fathi,_2012_CITE); disaster response ( Preece,_Shaw,_&_Hayashi,_2013,_2015_CITE); eco-community development ( Espinosa_&_Walker,_2013_CITE); service management ( Badinelli_et_al.,_2012_CITE), policing ( Brocklesby,_2012_CITE) and planning information systems in a UK Police Authority ( Kinloch,_Francis,_Francis,_&_Taylor,_2009_CITE)."
"Although case studies have been found to help it has been argued that there are few available that provide this guidance particularly in relation to some of the more detailed nuances of practice ( Ackermann,_2012_CITE, p_652)."
"Bar-Noy,_Bhatia,_Naor,_and_Schieber_(2002a)_CITE prove that the problem of finding a feasible perfect periodic schedule is an NP-hard problem in general"
"The following useful result follows directly from the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) ( Jones_&_Jones,_1998_CITE, Theorem 3.12)"
It was first proposed by Rescher and Manor already in 1970 [92]_CITE
A commonly accepted set of postulates for judging a logic-based merging operator was proposed in [68]_CITE
"These axioms (like those in the AGM theory of revision [2]_CITE) are directly inspired by choice function theory (see [16]_CITE for such a connexion) which defines axioms for the selection of best items from subsets of options, such that there exists a preference relation that can justify these choices"
"This way of envisaging knowledge-based fusion is explained in more details by Benferhat et al [7]_CITE, who show it comes down to merging possibilistic logic bases (see Section 6.3)."
An extensive overview of fusion methods in possibility theory appears in [52]_CITE.
"The reader is referred to the literature for details on this topic, especially the works of Benferhat and colleagues [7,8,11,12,62]_CITE as well as Liu and colleagues [75,75,89 91,117]_CITE."
".The most celebrated fusion rule is an associative operation called Dempster rule of combination [27,97]_CITE"
"Yager [113]_CITE proposed another form of renormalisation that ensures a strongly internally consistent result, while making the combination applicable to any pair of bba s, by reassigning the mass mS( ) to the whole set W"
"The recordings were taken from the evaluated motivational feedback corpus MOTI ( Wolff_&_Brechmann,_2012_CITE) which includes neutral, praising, blaming, and sympathetic prosodies for the evaluative feedback utterances employed here (ie, ja, richtig, etc.; see above) as well as for six pseudowords (words without semantic content) and was evaluated by 24 German native speakers (12 female) aged 20 35 years"
"The natural speech stimuli we employed stemmed from a corpus recorded from three female and three male speakers ( Wolff_&_Brechmann,_2012_CITE), and recordings from one of the female speakers were chosen based on high recognition rates in the manipulation check (see Section 2.2)"
The method commonly used for image background extraction is to select thresholds based on image color spaces [16]_CITE
"Although good performance was achieved by the method of watershed transform (derived from the morphology) using the image of region of interest for non-uniform images [14,15]_CITE, we keep our approach simple for three main reasons"
The details of the GP can be found in [22]_CITE.
The HSV transformation is widely used in image analysis for texture extraction [16]_CITE
"Using each of the best feature functions with the same MDC, the average accuracy rates over the ten-fold test sets are reported in Table 4 for the CDF-DRVC/GP-EM framework and are compared to the performance of the HROIT/GP-EM framework [37,38]_CITE"
"As a result of the CD implementation, we have achieved huge benefits, as summarized in Table 1 (these were reported in an earlier paper ( Chen,_2015_CITE))."
"In this paper we propose a method to convert a Java execution trace into a sequence of states that can be analyzed by the model checker Spin ( Holzmann,_2003_CITE)"
"Specifically, we combine the Spin model checker ( Holzmann,_2003_CITE) and the runtime debugging API Java Debug Interface (JDI) ( Java_Platform_Debugger_Architecture,_xxxx_CITE)"
"Both modules are integrated as a new Eclipse ( Eclipse_development_environment,_xxxx_CITE) plug-in for automatic debugging"
"This paper is an extension of previous work of ours presented in ( Adalid_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"To illustrate our proposal we use an FTP server ( Sorotokin,_xxxx_CITE)"
"However, the most interesting set of properties are complex requirements described with linear temporal logic (LTL) ( Manna_and_Pnueli,_1992_CITE)."
"Each Java execution is carried out in the target platform under the control of our runtime monitoring module, which has been implemented in Java using JDI ( Java_Platform_Debugger_Architecture,_xxxx_CITE)"
"When Java executions are finite, we take advantage of the stuttering mechanism implemented in Spin ( Holzmann,_2003_CITE), and we assume the semantics derived from considering the last state of the trace repeated forever"
"We are currently evaluating an extension of the memory representation described in ( Gallardo_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"The most notable tools for analyzing Java programs using some variant of full-state model checking are Bandera ( Corbett_et_al.,_2000_CITE) and Java PathFinder ( Visser_et_al.,_2003_CITE)"
"Java PathFinder ( Havelund_and_Pressburger,_2000_CITE) (JPF) is a complete model checker for Java programs that performs a complete coverage of a program, while our testing tool does a partial analysis of the program"
"However, it is important to note that, as shown in modified equation analysis [22]_CITE, the grid does effectively alter the equation set being solved"
Descriptions of the underlying logical arguments necessary to generate these meshes can be found in [27]_CITE.
The wide range of available filters in the table can be found in [10]_CITE
"For example, instances of under-resolved simulations can be readily found [28]_CITE"
The dynamic system f c( z) = z 2 + c is called Mandelbrot set (M-set) [1]_CITE as Mandelbrot first proposed it in 1982
"The weighted version of the straight skeleton, where edges no longer move at unit speed, was first mentioned by Eppstein and Erickson [2]_CITE and studied in detail by Biedl et al [4,5]_CITE"
"In the present work, in order to deal with the rotational motion after breaking, a new set of 2D horizontal Boussinesq-type of equations have been derived which include the effects of vorticity, by extending the 1D fully nonlinear approach of Musumeci et al [22]_CITE, in order to develop a model able to deal with combined wave-current motion often forced by the presence of natural and artificial complex bathymetry conditions"
In their classical paper Nadaoka et al [25]_CITE analysed the turbulent structures under spilling breaking waves
"As far as extended Boussinesq models are concerned, a widely adopted numerical solution strategy is the one proposed by Wei et al [2]_CITE, who successfully applied a fifth-order finite difference scheme for the spatial derivatives and a third-order predictor, fourth-order corrector scheme for the integration in time, known in the literature as Adams Bashforth Moulton or ABM scheme"
Another approach has been introduced more recently by S rensen et al [35]_CITE which bases the individuation of the toe of the roller on the time derivative of the free surface elevation
Therefore we adopt a new approach in our work which is similar to that of S rensen et al [34]_CITE and which is described below.
"In particular, the experimental data of Hansen and Svendsen [36]_CITE on the breaking of cnoidal waves has been used as a benchmark"
"In order to qualitatively validate the proposed model capabilities in estimating vorticity, the model of Dimakopoulos and Dimas [38]_CITE has been taken into account"
"The previous results can be qualitatively compared, for example, with the experimental results obtained by Nadaoka et al [25]_CITE"
In the present contribution the experiments on cnoidal breaking waves of Hansen and Svendsen [36]_CITE (see Fig_8) were used as a benchmark
"Azevedo_et al._(2011)_CITE brings a discussion about influence of extends association in use cases, which helps to count UCP more precisely"
"The TCF can be calculated according to the following formula ( Robiolo_et al.,_2009_CITE): (9)TCF=0.6+(0.01 T13T1WFc SIa)."
"See Connell_(2001),_Bryant_and_Darwin_(2004),_Phahlamohlaka_and_Friend_(2004)_and_S rensen_et_al._(2004)_CITE for examples."
"Champion_and_Wilson_(2010)_CITE provide a particularly useful set of contextual variables to be considered, based on a literature review and feedback from practitioners: organisational structure; influence of the external environment; length of history of the problem in focus; politics and personalities; perceived implementation difficulty; and the level of experience of stakeholders."
"We suggest that the following guidelines, derived from reflections on different systems paradigms (as represented by Jackson_(1991)_CITE, and others), can all contribute in different ways to boundary critique (the exploration of different possible boundaries, or frames, for a contextual analysis): Underpinning different boundary judgements may be quite different perspectives on the nature of the context (Churchman, 1970)"
"We note that our questions align well with five high level criteria suggested by Hjorts _(2004)_CITE for the evaluation of PSMs, except that our questions go into much more detail"
"We agree with Rowe_et_al._(2005)_CITE that assessing usability has to be a first priority, although validity and reliability should not be ignored"
"According to the most commonly accepted definition, Big Data is characterized by the 4 Vs [3]_CITE: volume, velocity, variety, and veracity"
CEPSim extends CloudSim [12]_CITE using a query model based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and introduces a simulation algorithm based on a novel abstraction called event sets
"This article significantly extends the authors previous work [15]_CITE by improving the discussion about CEPSim goals and assumptions, by introducing the event set concept, by presenting detailed descriptions of all simulation algorithms and a thorough evaluation of CEPSim"
"The basis of Complex Event Processing (CEP) was established by the work of Luckham on Rapide [10]_CITE, a distributed system simulator"
"Later on, the concepts were generalized and applied to the enterprise context in another study by Luckham [16]_CITE"
"At about the same time, the database community developed the first classical Stream Processing (SP) systems such as Aurora [17]_CITE and STREAM [18]_CITE"
The Continuous Query Language (CQL) [21]_CITE is the most prominent representative of this category.
The Aurora Stream Query Algebra (SQuAl) [17]_CITE inspired most languages in this category.
"Finally, the iCanCloud simulator [14]_CITE is similar to CloudSim, but it can also parallelize simulations and has a GUI to interact with the simulator"
"The queries used in the experiments in this section have been extracted from Powersmiths WOW system [41]_CITE, a sustainability management platform that draws on live measurements of buildings to support energy management"
Powersmiths WOW uses Apache Storm [31]_CITE to process in near real-time sensor readings coming from buildings managed by the platform.
"Apache Storm is an open-source distributed stream processing system that has been adopted by many enterprises, despite limitations regarding QoS maintenance, privacy, and security [42]_CITE"
"This validation approach is similar to the ones adopted by other simulators, such as NetworkCloudSim [9]_CITE, iCanCloud [14]_CITE, and Grozev and Buyya [35]_CITE."
An area-level linear mixed model with random area effects was first proposed by Fay_and_Herriot_(1979)_CITE to estimate average per-capita income in small places of the US
"In this setup, the introduced multivariate models contain the models proposed by Esteban_et al._(2011)_CITE as particular cases."
Their proof contains the general longitudinal model considered by Datta_and_Lahiri_(2000)_CITE as a special case
"By applying Lemmas 2 and A.3 of Prasad_and_Rao_(1990)_CITE, we finally obtain (F(i)+L(i))VAiVAjV(F(j)+L(j)) =O(D 2)DR DR and E[( i i)( j j)s(i)s(j) ]=cov( i, j)L(i)VL(j) +o(D 1)DR DR."
"Similarly as Prasad_and_Rao_(1990)_CITE , Datta_and_Lahiri_(2000)_CITE and Das_et al._(2004)_CITE , we estimate MSE( E) with (15)mse( E)=G1( )+G2( )+2G3( )"
This section compares the 2006 province poverty estimates of Esteban_et al._(2012)_CITE with the corresponding ones obtained in Applications 1 and 2 (appearing in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 respectively) and with the direct estimates
Datta_et al._(2002)_CITE also recommended the use of univariate methods because they are more simple to implement
"By applying Lemma A.2 of Prasad_and_Rao_(1990)_CITE, we have E=E[s1s2(q1 E[q1])(q2 E[q2])]= 1 E[v(v A1vv A2v)v ] 2 E[q1] 1 E[v(v A2v)v ] 2 E[q2] 1 E[v(v A1v)v ] 2+E[q1]E[q2] 1 V 2"
"By applying Lemma A.1(c) of Prasad_and_Rao_(1990)_CITE, we have E[v(v A1vv A2v)v ]=tr(A1V)tr(A2V)V+2tr(A1V)VA2V+2tr(A2V)VA1V+2tr(A1VA2V)V+4VA1VA2V+4VA2VA1V"
"By applying Lemma A.1(a) of Prasad_and_Rao_(1990)_CITE, we have E[v(v Aiv)v ]=tr(AiV)V+2VAiV,i=1,2"
"The definition of discourse used here is inspired by Habermas, who states that competing claims about truth, rightness and authenticity can be clarified by relying on the power of the best argument [7]_CITE"
"In fact, concern with the ethical aspects of computing coincides with the beginnings of digital computing and was famously expressed by Norbert Wiener [15]_CITE."
"One can observe numerous references to philosophical ethics, most notably the big three of (Kantian) deontology [16,17]_CITE, utilitarian consequentialism [18]_CITE and virtue ethics in the Aristotelian tradition [19]_CITE"
"Additionally, there are numerous other ethical approaches that are invoked in the area of computing, such as the ethics of care [21]_CITE, which may be useful for understanding particular aspects, such as the ethical side of gender issues in computing [22]_CITE, or the ethics underlying the capability approach developed by Sen [23]_CITE and Nussbaum [24]_CITE, which has been shown to be relevant to ethics-related research on ICT [25]_CITE, [26]_CITE."
"Within the Dutch philosophy of (information) technology there have also been interesting new developments focusing on the link between ethics and design, such as value sensitive design [29]_CITE, the morality of artefacts [30]_CITE, and thinking about responsible innovation, which has contributed to the development of RRI in general [31]_CITE."
"On the more technical side, there are theoretical positions stemming from areas such as engineering ethics [32]_CITE or technology ethics more broadly [33,34]_CITE that are relevant to computing"
"An interesting recent example of this is the Onlife Manifesto [42]_CITE, in which a number of leading scholars explore the ways in which computing technologies fundamentally change the world we live in and the way we relate to it."
"While the discourse on privacy can be traced back to Warren and Brandeis seminal paper [46]_CITE, the current relevance to computer ethics is that the availability of digital information and the possibility of storing, processing and disseminating it changes the nature of how we perceive privacy [47]_CITE"
The widely used and arguably highly misleading metaphor of piracy to denote intellectual property infringements [54 57]_CITE is an indication of the visceral quality of the debate.
"The seminal discussion of ethics in Information Systems by Mason in 1986 [77]_CITE, which coined the oft-cited acronym PAPA, touched on several of the aforementioned topics of computer ethics, namely, privacy, accuracy, property and access"
"The term responsible development , which is one of the roots of RRI, first appeared in the 21st century nano-technology research and development act (Public Law 108-153 [2]_CITE) in the US, where the concept is promoted as part of an initiative to strengthen nano-technological research."
A widely quoted definition of RRI from Von Schomberg [104]_CITE follows:
"We will also introduce the research context, research hypotheses, the used retrospective method ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE) and the experiment design including the treatments, response variables, and controlling the undesired variation"
"They are commonly defined as reflective practices ( Babb_et_al.,_2014_CITE), powerful tools for project teams to collectively identify communication gaps and practices to improve future projects ( Bjarnason_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"In software project retrospectives, CEDs are the most frequently used techniques ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"The detailed qualitative analysis of the causes is published in another paper ( Vanhanen_and_Lehtinen,_2014_CITE)"
Our method follows the postmortem analysis method introduced by Bj rnson_et_al._(2009)_CITE who claimed that such a retrospective method is lightweight and feasible for small software project teams
"Our hypotheses are also in line with the prior study about the cognitive maps ( Lee_et_al.,_1992_CITE)"
This section discusses the validity of our results using a validation scheme presented by Runeson_and_H st_(2008)_CITE
"Previously, we have qualitatively analyzed the causes which were detected in this study ( Vanhanen_and_Lehtinen,_2014_CITE) and we did not note any differences in the detected causes between the treatments"
We should continue the work of Bj rnsson_et_al._(2009)_CITE as one of the major challenges in the RCA of retrospectives is the high number of causes of problems
The reliability index is one of the widely accepted indicators to measure safety of engineering structures subject to uncertainties [12]_CITE
"Despite extensive research, such as the well known three stages of World Wide Failure Exercises [18 20]_CITE, a complete and validated methodology for predicting the behaviour of composite structures including the effects of damage has not yet been fully achieved"
First we will summarize the basic assumptions and the final formulae of the probabilistic homogenization method for the estimation of effective elastic moduli developed by the authors in [42]_CITE
"Among these methods, the Tsai Wu failure criterion [17]_CITE is the most frequently used because it takes into account the interactions between different stress components and provides a relatively accurate prediction of failure compared with other theories [22]_CITE"
"In this example, we study a single layer laminate that is made of carbon fibres embedded in an epoxy matrix with material properties indicated in [62]_CITE and listed in Table 1"
"In this section, PSMFEM-FORM and PSMFEM-SORM were used to analyse two multilayer laminates, which were studied in the first World Wide Failure Exercise (WWFE-I) [18]_CITE."
"Thus, the quasi-isotropic case is one of the most severe tests of using a lamina-level failure criterion to predict damage and failure of a laminate [54]_CITE"
"In order to offer to the reader a comprehensive review of this topic, the ABC ( Frontex,_2012a_CITE) is defined and its different topologies are described in the following"
"An ABC ( Frontex,_2012a_CITE) is a fully automated system that performs border checks"
An interesting study on performance and efficiency in possible hypothetical smart border scenarios may be read in PWC_(2014_CITE)
"This project is designed to establish and demonstrate a harmonized, modular approach for ABC gates ( FastPass,_2016_CITE)"
"The most common databases used for face recognition systems evaluation that were reported in the literature are the following ( Grgic_and_Delac,_2005_CITE): AR, FERET, SCface, Multi-PIE, Yale face database, Yale face database B, PIE, FIA, AT&T, Cohn-Kanade AU-Coded Facial Expression Database, MIT-CBCL, Image Database of Facial Actions and Expressions (Expression and Image database), Essex University, NIST Mugshot, NLPR, M2VTS, XM2VTS, the University of Oulu Physicsbased Face Dataset, CAS-PEAL, JAFFE, BioID HumanScan AG, PICS, UMIST, Max Plank, Caltech, EQUINOX HID, VALID, UCD Colour, Georgia Tech Face, Indian Face, VidTIMIT, LFW-a, 3D RMA, GavabDB, FRAV2D, FRAV3D, BJUT-3D, Bosphorus, PUT Face Database, BFM, Plastic Surgery, IFDB, Hong Kong Polytechnic University NIR Face Database, PolyU-HDFD, MOBIO, Texas 3DFRD, USTC-NVIE, FEI, ChokePoint, UMB database of 3D occluded faces, VADANA, MORPH, LDHF-DB, PhotoFace, EURECOM KFD, YouTube, YMU Dataset, VMU, MIW, 3dMAD, Senthilkumar, McGill Real-world Face Video, SiblingDB, the Adience image set and benchmark of unfiltered faces for age, gender, and subject classification, FaceScrub, LFW3D and Adience 3D set, FG-NET, FRVT, FRGV, FRGC, BANCA, PubFig, and the LFW dataset"
"As an example, the applicability of the system in Kosmerlj_et al._(2006_CITE) is high, meaning that the system proposed has a high applicability for an ABC system"
"It can be seen in this table that the systems having the highest evaluation of all the them are those described in Frontex_(2010_CITE) and in Spreeuwers_et al._(2012_CITE), with eight stars"
That presented in Kim_(2005_CITE) received the best score
"In Kumar_et al._(2009_CITE), two novel methods for face verification with real-world images, such as those in the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset and those from the PubFig dataset comprising images of public figures acquired from the Internet, were presented"
"In Manjupriya_et al._(2013_CITE), a face verification system that is very robust to changes in illumination was proposed"
"These results satisfy the best practical technical guidelines for the efficiency of ABC systems ( Frontex,_2012a_CITE)"
"These algorithms are frequently employed for this purpose, in particular when a high level of invariant external parameters, such as lighting, is desired ( Belhumeur_et al.,_1997_CITE)"
Pasternak [2]_CITE proposed a two-parameter model which can consider the transverse shear deformation to make up the deficiency of the Winker model and it is widely used by many researchers [7 9]_CITE
Higher-order shear deformation theories (HSDTs) have also attracted much attentions as they can provide more accurate predictions for static and dynamic analysis of beams and plates [12 17]_CITE
"Nevertheless, the Timoshenko beam theory is the simplest solution for the analysis of a granular fill layer whose thickness cannot be neglected [6,18]_CITE."
"For a uniform beam with a rectangular cross section, the shear stiffness C and the correction coefficient k are recommended by Cowper [37]_CITE in the following: (A14)C=kGeA;k=10(1+v)12+11v,where G e and v are equivalent shear modulus and Poisson's ratio of the beam with reinforcement"
"There is only a small number of works (eg Conte_et_al.,_2005_CITE), where graph pyramids are employed on spatio-temporal data and to the best of our knowledge there is no work employing graph pyramids to extract models based on the motion of features in a triangulation."
"This paper extends the work in ( Artner_et_al.,_2009_CITE) for out of plane motion and shows additional experimental results."
"The entries in the transformation matrix can be calculated by solving the resulting 6 linear equations ( Klein,_1939_CITE)."
"The affine transformation matrix T r( t), which has the form in Eq (2), is determined by solving a linear system of equations ( Klein,_1939_CITE)."
"Edges to be contracted are selected from the edges proposed by the Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm by Boruvka ( Nesetril_et_al.,_2001_CITE) (Line 4)."
"The input data, videos and trajectories, for this experiments are from the benchmark used by Yan_et_al._(2008)_CITE"
"The experiment toy truck successfully results in two rigid parts as in ( Yan_et_al.,_2008_CITE)"
For further details on the virtual work approach we refer to [17]_CITE
"The novel contributions of this work are as follows: first, rather than the moving mesh and direct force calculation strategy previously employed in [5,6]_CITE, we adopt a stress tensor approach, similar to that described in [18,19]_CITE, which by-passes the need to calculate local forces and provides a natural framework for the coupling"
"Second, inspired by the work of Lacoste [26]_CITE, we provide a rigorous treatment of the weak forms of the coupled eddy current and linear elastic problems in axisymmetric coordinates, which allows us to overcome frequently adopted approximations at the radial axis eg [27 30]_CITE"
"We remark that a similar setup has been employed in [5,6]_CITE for the simulations of magneto mechanical vibrations from MRI scanners"
"In addition, appropriate interface conditions should be supplied for each of the fields in a similar manner to [18]_CITE"
"In the following, we state fully the boundary value problems for HDC and HAC implied by [8]_CITE and present a new stress tensor approach for handling b."
"If the fields can be represented as complex amplitudes, the (average) Ohmic power (or dissipated power), as a function of the drive frequency, can be computed according to [34]_CITE (16)P o( ,AAC)=12 1|Jo|2d =12 |EAC|2d =12 |i AAC|2d ."
"The approach presented in [8]_CITE has been reported to give a 20 100 factor reduction in computational time compared to a previous transient formulation [5]_CITE and, along similar lines, we present a fixed point algorithm for the solution of (9) (11) in Algorithm 1."
An automated decision support system (DSS) that could detect and annotate seizures on the neonatal EEG would be extremely useful for clinicians in the NICU [44]_CITE
Detailed information on the system can be found in [19]_CITE.
"In both cases, retrospectively with LOO cross validation and using prospective datasets, similar levels of performance were achieved as measured by the mean area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) with 95.4% in [34]_CITE, 96.1% in [33]_CITE and 96.7% in [21]_CITE."
The importance of rigorous and adaptive clinical DSS design to bridge the gap between academic research and clinical practice using technology acceptance models has been discussed in [53]_CITE
Traditional and novel technology-mediated medical decision making approaches have been critically examined in [60]_CITE
"We are now in a position to give an easy proof for the following theorem, which is the main result in [6]_CITE, (see also [40]_CITE)."
"Impressively, White et al [34]_CITE were able to not only accurately model encrypted Skype activity using side-channel properties, but also reconstruct entire spoken conversations from timing and size characteristics although it did not generalise well to variations in speech patterns ( eg a different regional dialect)"
"The same local sender and receiver MAC addresses, frame size and timing data that would also be available from an external perspective is extracted using TShark from the well-known Wireshark packet analysis suite [38]_CITE"
"To construct a classifier from the available data, we employed Random Forest machine learning using the BigRF package in R [42,43]_CITE"
"Some versatile approaches in the literature are, for example; Wong_and_Hamouda_(2003a)_CITE, where an online knowledge based fuzzy expert system for machinability data selection using Fuzzy Logic as reasoning mechanism in capturing the knowledge of machining operators is developed"
"It is widely modelled as ( Balanchandran,_2001;_Budak_&_Altintas,_1998_CITE), (3)tc(t)=fr sin"
"Frequency domain outputs the well-known stability charts, which gives stability frontiers in the cutting space parameter ( Altintas,_2000;_Balanchandran,_2001_CITE)"
The threshold of instability is selected to be 1.25 as in Campomanes_and_Altintas_(2003)_CITE
In the expert system a spindle speed is selected automatically as Smith_and_Tlusty_(1992)_CITE proposed

"Since its introduction in Grossberg_(1976a,_1976b)_CITE, ART has been incrementally developed into a cognitive and neural theory of how the brain autonomously learns to attend, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world, without experiencing catastrophic forgetting"
"These processes were first modeled in Grossberg_(1984a)_CITE and have provided a foundation for subsequent explanations and predictions about many data, including how looking at 2D pictures can generate conscious 3D percepts of occluding and occluded objects (eg, Cao_&_Grossberg,_2005;_Dresp,_Durand,_&_Grossberg,_2002;_Dresp-Langley_&_Grossberg,_2016;_Fang_&_Grossberg,_2009;_Grossberg,_1994,_1997,_2016a;_Grossberg_&_Yazdanbakhsh,_2005;_Kelly_&_Grossberg,_2000;_Tanca,_Grossberg,_&_Pinna,_2010_CITE)."

"For example, studies of visual perception and visual imagery in humans using PET and rTMS show activation of V1 during both kinds of percepts, and interference of both by applying rTMS to V1 ( Kosslyn_et al.,_1999_CITE)"
