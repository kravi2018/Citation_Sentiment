'Unfortunately , this is not the case for such widely used MT evaluation metrics as BLEU <CIT> and NIST <OTH> '
'<OTH> applied the parser of <CIT> developed for English , to Czech , and found thatthe performance wassubstantially lower when compared to the results for English '
'Hanks and <CIT> proposed using pointwise mutual information to identify collocations in lexicography ; however , the method may result in unacceptable collocations for low-count pairs '
'Unlike <CIT> , Smadja -LRB- 1993 -RRB- goes beyond the ` two-word '' limitation and deals with ` collocations of arbitrary length '' '
'2This can explain why previous attempts to use WordNet for generating sentence-level paraphrases <CIT> were unsuccessful '
'We have also illustrated that ASIA outperforms three other English systems <CIT> , even though many of these use more input than just a semantic class name '
'For unknown words , SCL gives a relative reduction in error of 195 % over <CIT> , even with 40,000 sentences of source domain training data '
'For comparison purposes , we revisit a fullygenerative Bayesian model for unsupervised coreference resolution recently introduced by <CIT> , discuss its potential weaknesses and consequently propose three modifications to their model -LRB- Section 3 -RRB- '
'Unfortunately , there is no straightforward generalization of the method of <CIT> to the two edge marginal problem '
'Previous literature on GB parsing \/ Wehrli , 1984 ; Sharp , 1985 ; <CIT> , 1986 ; Kuhns , 1986 ; Abney , 1986\/has not addressed the issue of implementation of the Binding theory -RRB- The present paper intends in part to fill this gap '
'In general , these authors have found that existing lexicalized parsing models for English <CIT> do not straightforwardly generalize to new languages ; this typically manifests itself in a severe reduction in parsing performance compared to the results for English '
'This method was shown to outperform the class based model proposed in <CIT> and can thus be expected to discover better clusters of words '
'Although a rich literature covers bootstrapping methods applied to natural language problems <CIT> several questions remain unanswered when these methods are applied to syntactic or semantic pattern acquisition '
'It also differs from previous proposals on lexical acquisition using statistical measures such as <CIT> which either deny the prior existence of linguistic knowledge or use linguistic knowledge in ad hoc ways '
'In pursuit of better translation , phrase-based models <OTH> havesignificantlyimprovedthe quality over classical word-based models <CIT> '
'Several studies have shown that large-margin methods can be adapted to the special complexities of the task <CIT> However , the capacity of these algorithms to improve over state-of-the-art baselines is currently limited by their lack of robust dimensionality reduction '
'The 746 % final accuracy on apartments is higher than any result obtained by <CIT> -LRB- the highest is 741 % -RRB- , higher than the supervised HMM results reported by Grenager et al '
'One prominent constraint of the IBM word alignment models <CIT> is functional alignment , that is each target word is mapped onto at most one source word '
'Although the first three are particular cases where N = 1 and\/or M = 1 , the distinction is relevant , because most word-based translation models -LRB- eg IBM models <CIT> -RRB- can typically not accommodate general M-N alignments '
'Inside-out alignments <CIT> , such as the one in Example 13 , can not be induced by any of these theories ; in fact , there seems to be no useful synchronous grammar formalisms available that handle inside-out alignments , with the possible exceptions of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars <OTH> , Bertsch and Nederhof <OTH> and generalized multitext grammars <OTH> , which are all way more complex than ITG , STSG and -LRB- 2,2 -RRB- - BRCG '
'Bilexical context-free grammars have been presented in <OTH> as an abstraction of language models that have been adopted in several recent real-world parsers , improving state-of-the-art parsing accuracy <CIT> '
'For the Penn Treebank , <CIT> reports an accuracy of 966 % using the Maximum Entropy approach , our much simpler and therefore faster HMM approach delivers 967 % '
'While SCL has been successfully applied to PoS tagging and Sentiment Analysis <CIT> , its effectiveness for parsing was rather unexplored '

'In terms of alignment , this wordnumber difference means that multiword connections must be considered , a task which 334 Sue J Ker and Jason S Chang Word Alignment is beyond the reach of methods proposed in recent alignment works based on <CIT> Model 1 and 2 '
'2 Motivation and Prior Work While several authors have looked at the supervised adaptation case , there are less -LRB- and especially less successful -RRB- studies on semi-supervised domain adaptation <CIT> '
'In particular , the model in <CIT> failed to generate punctuation , a deficiency of the model '
'1 Introduction Phrase-based translation models <OTH> , which go beyond the original IBM translation models <CIT> 1 by modeling translations of phrases rather than individual words , have been suggested to be the state-of-theart in statistical machine translation by empirical evaluations '
'Table 2 : Figures about clustering algorithms Algorithm # Sentences \/ # Clusters S-HAC 6,23 C-HAC 2,17 QT 2,32 EM 4,16 In fact , table 2 shows that most of the clusters have less than 6 sentences which leads to question the results presented by <CIT> who only keep the clusters that contain more than 10 sentences '
'These methods go beyond the original IBM machine translation models <CIT> , by allowing multi-word units -LRB- phrases -RRB- in one language to be translated directly into phrases in another language '
'1 Introduction Recent works in statistical machine translation -LRB- SMT -RRB- shows how phrase-based modeling <OTH> significantly outperform the historical word-based modeling <CIT> '
'Our system outperforms competing approaches , including the standard machine translation alignment models <CIT> and the state-of-the-art Cut and Paste summary alignment technique <OTH> '
'For example , we would like to know that if a -LRB- JJ , JJ -RRB- 7We also tried using word clusters <CIT> instead of POS but found that POS was more helpful '
'This is because their training data , the Penn Treebank <CIT> , does not fully annotate NP structure '
'Although this Wikipedia gazetteer is much smaller than the English version used by <CIT> that has over 2,000,000 entries , it is the largest gazetteer that can be freely used for Japanese NER '
'As the tagger of <CIT> can not tag a word lattice , we can not back off to this tagging '
'Point-wise mutual information -LRB- PMI -RRB- is commonly used for computing the association of two terms <CIT> , which is defined as : nullnullnull null null , null null nullnullnull nullnullnullnull , nullnull nullnull null null null nullnullnullnullnull However , we argue that PMI is not a suitable measure for our purpose '
'Moreover , the parameters of the model must be estimated using averaged perceptron training <CIT> , which can be unstable '
'This method has the advantage that it is not limited to the model scaling factors as the method described in <CIT> '
'They reported that their method is superior to BLEU <CIT> in terms of the correlation between human assessment and automatic evaluation '
'While the idea of exploiting multiple news reports for paraphrase acquisition is not new , previous efforts <CIT> have been restricted to at most two news sources '
'Furthermore , we provide a 638 % error reduction compared to IBM Model 4 <CIT> '
'With all but two formats IBI-IG achieves better FZ = l rates than the best published result in <CIT> '
'A maximum entropy approach has been applied to partof-speech tagging before <CIT> , but the approach ''s ability to incorporate nonlocal and non-HMM-tagger-type evidence has not been fully explored '
'If we consider these probabilities as a vector , the similarities of two English words can be obtained by computing the dot product of their corresponding vectors2 The formula is described below : similarity -LRB- ei , ej -RRB- = Nsummationdisplay k = 1 p -LRB- ei fk -RRB- p -LRB- ej fk -RRB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- Paraphrasing methods based on monolingual parallel corpora such as <CIT> can also be used to compute the similarity ratio of two words , but they dont have as rich training resources as the bilingual methods do '
'32 Evaluation Metrics AER -LRB- Alignment Error Rate -RRB- <CIT> is the most widely used metric of alignment quality , but requires gold-standard alignments labeled with sure\/possible annotations to compute ; lacking such annotations , we can compute alignment fmeasure instead '
'Clustering algorithms have been previously shown to work fairly well for the classification of words into syntactic and semantic classes <CIT> , but determining the optimum number of classes for a hierarchical cluster tree is an ongoing difficult problem , particularly without prior knowledge of the item classification '
'Although , there are various manual\/automatic evaluation methods for these systems , eg , BLEU <CIT> , these methods are basically incapable of dealing with an MTsystem and a w\/p-MT-system at the same time , as they have different output forms '
'However , reordering models in traditional phrase-based systems are not sufficient to treat such complex cases when we translate long sentences <CIT> '
'Current tree-based models that integrate linguistics and statistics , such as GHKM <CIT> , are not able to generalize well from a single phrase pair '
'Our syntactic-relation-based thesaurus is based on the method proposed by <CIT> , although Hindle did not apply it to information retrieval '
'Both Charniak <OTH> and Bikel <OTH> were trained using the goldstandard tags , as this produced higher accuracy on the development set than using <CIT> s tags '
'The utility of ITG as a reordering constraint for most language pairs , is well-known both empirically <OTH> and analytically <CIT> , howeverITGsstraight -LRB- monotone -RRB- andinverted -LRB- reverse -RRB- rules exhibit strong cohesiveness , which is inadequate to express orientations that require gaps '
'This latter point is a critical difference that contrasts to the major weakness of the work of <CIT> which uses a top-N list of translations to select the maximum BLEU sentence as a target for training -LRB- so called local update -RRB- '
'Even the creators of BLEU point out that it may not correlate particularly well with human judgment at the sentence level <CIT> '
'1 Introduction In recent years , various phrase translation approaches <OTH> have been shown to outperform word-to-word translation models <CIT> '
'Sentence-level approximations to B exist <CIT> , but we found it most effective to perform B computations in the context of a setOof previously-translated sentences , following Watanabe et al '
'In such a process , original phrase-based decoding <CIT> does not take advantage of any linguistic analysis , which , however , is broadly used in rule-based approaches '
'However , many of these models are not applicable to parallel treebanks because they assume translation units where either the source text , the target text or both are represented as word sequences without any syntactic structure <CIT> '
'2 Statistical Word Alignment Statistical translation models <CIT> only allow word to word and multi-word to word alignments '
'Even the 3 A demo of the parser can be found at http://lfgdemocomputingdcuie/lfgparserhtml creators of BLEU point out that it may not correlate particularly well with human judgment at the sentence level <CIT> '
'Our method , extending this line of research with the use of labeled LFG dependencies , partial matching , and n-best parses , allows us to considerably outperform <CIT> highest correlations with human judgement -LRB- they report 0144 for the correlation with human fluency judgement , 0202 for the correlation with human overall judgement -RRB- , although it has to be kept in mind that such comparison is only tentative , as their correlation is calculated on a different test set '
'Unlike well-known bootstrapping approaches <CIT> , EM and CE have the possible advantage of maintaining posteriors over hidden labels -LRB- or structure -RRB- throughout learning ; bootstrapping either chooses , for each example , a single label , or remains completely agnostic '
'1 Introduction Recent approaches to statistical machine translation -LRB- SMT -RRB- piggyback on the central concepts of phrasebased SMT <CIT> and at the same time attempt to improve some of its shortcomings by incorporating syntactic knowledge in the translation process '
'For the results in this paper , we have used Pointwise Mutual Information -LRB- PMI -RRB- instead of IBM Model 1 <CIT> , since <OTH> found it to be as effective on Springer , but faster to compute '
'Numbers in the table correspond to the percentage of experiments in which the condition at the head of the column was true -LRB- for example figure in the first row and first column means that for 989 percent of the language pairs the BLEU score for the bidirectional decoder was better than that of the forward decoder -RRB- proach <CIT> -RRB- '
'This provides a compelling advantage over previous dependency language models for MT <CIT> , whichusea5-gramLMonlyduringreranking '
'Experimental results indicate that our model outperforms <CIT> coreference model by a large margin on the ACE data sets and compares favorably to a modified version of their model '
'This method was preferred against other related methods , like the one introduced in <CIT> , since it embeds all the available semantic information existing in WordNet , even edges that cross POS , thus offering a richer semantic representation '
'Both the global models <CIT> use fairly small training sets , and there is no evidence that their techniques will scale to larger data sets '
'Our model improves the baseline provided by <CIT> : -LRB- i -RRB- accuracy is increased by creating a lexicalised PCFG grammar and enriching conditioning context with parent f-structure features ; and -LRB- ii -RRB- coverage is increased by providing lexical smoothing and fuzzy matching techniques for rule smoothing '
'While the model of <CIT> significantly outperforms the constrained model of <OTH> , they both are well below the state-of-the-art in constituent parsing '
'By doing so we must emphasize that , as described in the previous section , the BLEU score was not designed to deliver satisfactory results at the sentence level <CIT> , and this also applies to the closely related NIST score '
'<CIT> focus on alignment and do not present MT results , while May and Knight -LRB- 2007 -RRB- takesthesyntacticre-alignmentasaninputtoanEM algorithm where the unaligned target words are insertedintothetemplatesandminimumtemplatesare combinedintobiggertemplates <OTH> '
'But without the global normalization , the maximumlikelihood criterion motivated by the maximum entropy principle <CIT> is no longer a feasible option as an optimization criterion '
'? ? word class : <CIT> measures polarity using only adjectives , however in our approach we consider the noun , the verb , the adverb and the adjective content words '
'While most parsing methods are currently supervised or semi-supervised <CIT> , they depend on hand-annotated data which are difficult to come by and which exist only for a few languages '
'To analyze our methods on IV and OOV words , we use a detailed evaluation metric than Bakeoff 2006 <CIT> which includes Foov and Fiv '
'Surprisingly , although JESS-CM is a simpler version of the hybrid model in terms of model structure and parameter estimation procedure , JESS-CM provides F-scores of 9445 and 8803 for CoNLL00 and 03 data , respectively , which are 015 and 083 points higher than those reported in <CIT> for the same configurations '
'We presented some theoretical arguments for not limiting extraction to minimal rules , validated them on concrete examples , and presented experiments showing that contextually richer rules provide a 363 BLEU point increase over the minimal rules of <CIT> '
'Our study also shows that the simulated-annealing algorithm <OTH> is more effective 1552 than the perceptron algorithm <CIT> for feature weight tuning '
'By segmenting words into morphemes , we can improve the performance of natural language systems including machine translation <CIT> and information retrieval <OTH> '
'Statistical disambiguation such as <CIT> for PP-attachment or <CIT> for generative parsing greatly improve disambiguation , but as they model by imitation instead of by understanding , complete soundness has to remain elusive '
'It can be applied to complicated models such IBM Model-4 <CIT> '

'2 21 Word Alignment Adaptation Bi-directional Word Alignment In statistical translation models <CIT> , only one-to-one and more-to-one word alignment links can be found '
'The method was intended as a replacement for sentence-based methods -LRB- eg , <CIT> -RRB- , which are very sensitive to noise '
'This approach addresses the problematic aspects of both pure knowledge-based generation -LRB- where incomplete knowledge is inevitable -RRB- and pure statistical bag generation <CIT> -LRB- where the statistical system has no linguistic guidance -RRB- '
'In addition , the clustering methods used , such as HMMs and Browns algorithm <CIT> , seem unable to adequately capture the semantics of MNs since they are based only on the information of adjacent words '
'We preferred the log-likelihood ratio to other statistical scores , such as the association ratio <CIT> or ; -LRB- 2 , since it adequately takes into account the frequency of the co-occurring words and is less sensitive to rare events and corpussize <OTH> '
'The ubiquitous minimum error rate training -LRB- MERT -RRB- approach optimizes Viterbi predictions , but does not explicitly boost the aggregated posterior probability of desirable n-grams <CIT> '
'However , work in that direction has so far addressed only parse reranking <CIT> '
'The combination is significantly better than <CIT> at a very high level , but more importantly , Shens results -LRB- currently representing the replicable state-of-the-art in POS tagging -RRB- have been significantly surpassed also by the semisupervised Morce -LRB- at the 99 % confidence level -RRB- '
'a time-consuming process <CIT> '
'Other statistical machine translation systems such as <CIT> and <OTH> also produce a tree a15 given a sentence a16 Their models are based on mechanisms that generate two languages at the same time , so an English tree a15 is obtained as a subproduct of parsing a16 However , their use of the LM is not mathematically motivated , since their models do not decompose into Pa4a5a2a9a8a3a10a6 and a12a14a4a5a3a7a6 unlike the noisy channel model '
'WSD systems have been far more successful in distinguishing coarsegrained senses than fine-grained ones <CIT> , but does that approach neglect necessary meaning differences ? '
'Secondly , while most pronoun resolution evaluations simply exclude non-referential pronouns , recent unsupervised approaches <CIT> must deal with all pronouns in unrestricted text , and therefore need robust modules to automatically handle non-referential instances '
'12Poon and Domingos <OTH> outperformed <CIT> '
'As with similar work <CIT> , the size of the corpus makes preprocessing such as lemmatization , POS tagging or partial parsing , too costly '
'The size of the development set used to generate 1 and 2 <OTH> compensates the tendency of the unsmoothed MERT algorithm to overfit <CIT> by providing a high ratio between number of variables and number of parameters to be estimated '
'<CIT> have proposed a rule-based algorithm for sentence combination , but no results have been reported '
'<CIT> provides anecdotal evidence that only incorrect alignments are eliminated by ITG constraints '
'By segmenting words into morphemes , we can improve the performance of natural language systems including machine translation <CIT> and information retrieval <OTH> '
'It has been difficult to identify all and only those cases where a token functions as a discourse connective , and in many cases , the syntactic analysis in the Penn TreeBank <CIT> provides no help '
'For example , 10 million words of the American National Corpus <OTH> will have manually corrected POS tags , a tenfold increase over the Penn Treebank <CIT> , currently used for training POS taggers '
'The process of phrase extraction is difficult to optimize in a non-discriminative setting : many heuristics have been proposed <CIT> , but it is not obvious which one should be chosen for a given language pair '
'While several methods have been proposed to automatically extract compounds <CIT> , we know of no successful attempt to automatically make classes of compounds '
'Many approaches for POS tagging have been developed in the past , including rule-based tagging <OTH> , HMM taggers <CIT> , maximum-entropy models <OTH> , cyclic dependency networks <OTH> , memory-based learning <OTH> , etc All of these approaches require either a large amount of annotated training data -LRB- for supervised tagging -RRB- or a lexicon listing all possible tags for each word -LRB- for unsupervised tagging -RRB- '
'Our focus is on the sentence level , unlike <OTH> and <CIT> ; we employ a significantly larger set of seed words , and we explore as indicators of orientation words from syntactic classes other than adjectives -LRB- nouns , verbs , and adverbs -RRB- '
'This additional conditioning has the effect of making the choice of generation rules sensitive to the history of the generation process , and , we argue , provides a simpler , more uniform , general , intuitive and natural probabilistic generation model obviating the need for CFG-grammar transforms in the original proposal of <CIT> '
'1 Introduction The most widely applied training procedure for statistical machine translation IBM model 4 <OTH> unsupervised training followed by post-processing with symmetrization heuristics <CIT> yields low quality word alignments '
'This is in contrast to purely statistical systems <CIT> , which are difficult to inspect and modify '
'In addition , the semi-supervised Morce performs -LRB- on single CPU and development data set -RRB- 77 times faster than the combination and 23 times faster than <CIT> '
'In a recent study by <CIT> , nonlocal information is encoded using an independence model , and the inference is performed by Gibbs sampling , which enables us to use a stateof-the-art factored model and carry out training efficiently , but inference still incurs a considerable computational cost '
'<CIT> suggests use of an approximation summing over the training data , which does not sum over possible tags : '' h E f j = 2 P -LRB- ~ -RRB- p -LRB- ti l hi -RRB- f j -LRB- hi , ti -RRB- i = 1 However , we believe this passage is in error : such an estimate is ineffective in the iterative scaling algorithm '
'IBM Model1 <CIT> is a simplistic model which takes no account of the subtler aspects of language translation including the way word order tends to differ across languages '
'A number of studies have investigated sentiment classification at document level , eg , <CIT> , and at sentence level , eg , <OTH> ; however , the accuracy is still less than desirable '
'Automatic evaluation methods such as BLEU <CIT> , RED <OTH> , or the weighted N-gram model proposed here may be more consistent in judging quality as compared to human evaluators , but human judgments remain the only criteria for metaevaluating the automatic methods '
'For comparison purposes , we revisit <CIT> fully-generative Bayesian model for unsupervised coreference resolution , discuss its potential weaknesses and consequently propose three modifications to their model '
'The class-based kappa statistic of <CIT> can not be applied here , as the classes vary depending on the number of ambiguities per entry in the lexicon '
'While the amount of parallel data required to build such systems is orders of magnitude smaller than corresponding phrase based statistical systems <CIT> , the variety of linguistic annotation required is greater '
'Although this method is comparatively easy to be implemented , it just achieves the same performance as the synchronous binarization method <CIT> for syntaxbased SMT systems '
'Among the applications of collocational analysis for lexical acquisition are: the derivation of syntactic disambiguation cues (Basili et al. 1991, 1993a; Hindle and Rooths 1991,1993; Sekine 1992) (Bogges et al. 1992), sense preference (Yarowski 1992), acquisition of selectional restrictions (Basili et al. 1992b, 1993b; Utsuro et al. 1993), lexical preference in generation (Smadjia 1991), word clustering (Pereira 1993; Hindle 1990; Basili et al. 1993c), etc. In the majority of these papers, even though the (precedent or subsequent) statistical processing reduces the number of accidental associations, very large corpora (10,000,000 words) are necessary to obtain reliable data on a ''large enough'' number of words.'
'Due to limited variations in the N-Best list , the nature of ranking , and more importantly , the non-differentiable objective functions used for MT -LRB- such as BLEU <CIT> -RRB- , one often found only local optimal solutions to , with no clue to walk out of the riddles '
'We also compare our performance against <OTH> and <CIT> and find that we manage higher relative improvement than existing work despite starting from a very competitive baseline CRF '
'Although several methods have already been proposed to incorporate non-local features <CIT> , these present a problem that the types of non-local features are somewhat constrained '
'The morphological processing in PairClass <OTH> is more sophisticated than in <CIT> '
'In addition , the performance of the adapted model for Joint S&T obviously surpass that of <CIT> , which achieves an F1 of 9341 % for Joint S&T , although with more complicated models and features '
'Some are the result of inconsistency in labeling in the training data <CIT> , which usually reflects a lack of linguistic clarity or determination of the correct part of speech in context '
'Therefore , sublanguage techniques such as Sager <OTH> and <CIT> do not work '
'2Mutual information , though potentially of interest as a measure of collocational status , was not tested due to its well-known property of overemphasising the significance of rare events <CIT> '
'While in traditional word-based statistical models <CIT> the atomic unit that translation operates on is the word , phrase-based methods acknowledge the significant role played in language by multiword expressions , thus incorporating in a statistical framework the insight behind Example-Based Machine Translation <OTH> '
'Note that the minimum error rate training <CIT> uses only the target sentence with the maximum posterior probability whereas , here , the whole probability distribution is taken into account '
'A word order correlation bias , as well as the phrase structure biases in <CIT> Models 4 and 5 , would be less beneficial with noisier training bitexts or for language pairs with less similar word order '
'Although various approaches to SMT system combination have been explored , including enhanced combination model structure <CIT> , better word alignment between translations <OTH> and improved confusion network construction <CIT> , most previous work simply used the ensemble of SMT systems based on different models and paradigms at hand and did not tackle the issue of how to obtain the ensemble in a principled way '
'1 Introduction The field of machine translation has seen many advances in recent years , most notably the shift from word-based <CIT> to phrasebased models which use token n-grams as translation units <OTH> '
'Although ITA rates and system performance both significantly improve with coarse-grained senses <CIT> , the question about what level of granularity is needed remains '
'three models in <CIT> are susceptible to the O -LRB- n 3 -RRB- method -LRB- cf '
'Even with the current incomplete set of semantic templates , the hypertagger brings realizer performance roughly up to state-of-the-art levels , as our overall test set BLEU score <OTH> slightly exceeds that of <CIT> , though at a coverage of 96 % insteadof98 % '
'An alternative method <CIT> makes decisions at the end but has a high computational requirement '
'Several teams had approaches that relied (to varying degrees) on an IBM model of statistical machine translation (Brown et al. , 1993), with different improvements brought by different teams, consisting of new submodels, improvements in the HMM model, model combination for optimal alignment, etc. Se-veral teams used symmetrization metrics, as introduced in (Och and Ney, 2003) (union, intersection, refined), most of the times applied on the alignments produced for the two directions sourcetarget and targetsource, but also as a way to combine different word alignment systems.'
'In the thriving area of research on automatic analysis and processing of product reviews <CIT> , little attention has been paid to the important task studied here assessing review helpfulness '
'In such tasks , feature calculation is also very expensive in terms of time required ; huge sets of extracted rules must be sorted in two directions for relative frequency calculation of such features as the translation probability p -LRB- f e -RRB- and reverse translation probability p -LRB- e f -RRB- <CIT> '
'Other statistical systems that address word classification probleans do not emphasize the use of linguistic knowledge and do not deal with a specific word class <CIT> , or do not exploit as much linguistic knowledge as we do <OTH> '
'As one can see in Table 4 , the resulting parser ranks among the best lexicalized parsers , beating those of Collins <OTH> and Charniak and Johnson <OTH> 8 Its F1 performance is a 27 % reduction in error over <CIT> et al '
'Our experiments on the Canadian Hansards show that our unsupervised technique is significantly more effective than picking seeds by hand <CIT> , which in turn is known to rival supervised methods '
'2 Related Work One of the major problems with the IBM models <CIT> and the HMM models <OTH> is that they are restricted to the alignment of each source-language word to at most one targetlanguage word '
'This implies that the complexity of structure divergence between two languages is higher than suggested in literature <CIT> '
'<OTH> report better perplexity results on the Verbmobil Corpus with their HMMbased alignment model in comparison to Model 2 of <CIT> '
'<OTH> have implemented a dependency parser with good accuracy -LRB- it is almost as good at dependency parsing as Charniak <OTH> -RRB- and very impressive speed -LRB- it is about ten times faster than <CIT> and four times faster than Charniak <OTH> -RRB- '
'Unlike minimum error rate training <CIT> , our system is able to exploit large numbers of specific features in the same manner as static reranking systems <CIT> '
'However , to what extent that assumption holds is tested only on a small number of language pairs using hand aligned data <CIT> '
'Although evaluated on a different test set , our method also outperforms the correlation with human scores reported in <CIT> '
'However , it seems unrealistic to expect a one-size-fits-all approach to be achieve uniformly high performance across varied languages , and , in fact , it doesnt Though the system presented in <CIT> outperforms the best systems in the 2006 PASCAL challenge for Turkish and Finnish , it still does significantly worse on these languages than English -LRB- F-scores of 662 and 665 , compared to 794 -RRB- '
'For comparison purposes , three additional heuristically-induced alignments are generated for each system : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Intersection of both directions -LRB- Aligner -LRB- int -RRB- -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- Union of both directions -LRB- Aligner -LRB- union -RRB- -RRB- ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- The previously bestknown heuristic combination approach called growdiag-final <CIT> -LRB- Aligner -LRB- gdf -RRB- -RRB- '
'Brill ''s results demonstrate that this approach can outperform the Hidden Markov Model approaches that are frequently used for part-of-speech tagging <CIT> , as well as showing promise for other applications '
'It has the advantage of naturally capturing local reorderings and is shown to outperform word-based machine translation <CIT> '
'Again the best result was obtained with IOB1 <OTH> which is an imI -RRB- rovement of the best reported F , ~ = 1 rate for this data set -LRB- <CIT> : 9203 -RRB- '
'This is well illustrated by the Collins parser <CIT> , scrutinized by Bikel -LRB- 2004 -RRB- , where several transformations are applied in order to improve the analysis of noun phrases , coordination and punctuation '
'It is faster and more mnemonic than the one in <CIT> '
'1 Introduction Translations tables in Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation -LRB- SMT -RRB- are often built on the basis of Maximum-likelihood Estimation -LRB- MLE -RRB- , being one of the major limitations of this approach that the source sentence context in which phrases occur is completely ignored <CIT> '
'In what concerns the evaluation process , although ROUGE <CIT> is the most common evaluation metric for the automatic evaluation of summarization , since our approach might introduce in the summary information that it is not present in the original input source , we found that a human evaluation was more adequate to assess the relevance of that additional information '
'The program takes the output of char_align <OTH> , a robust alternative to sentence-based alignment programs , and applies word-level constraints using a version of Brown el al ''s Model 2 <CIT> , modified and extended to deal with robustness issues '
'6 Conclusion Traditional approaches for devising parsing models , smoothing techniques and evaluation metrics are not well suited for MH , as they presuppose 13The lack of head marking , for instance , precludes the use of lexicalized models a la <CIT> '
'The experimental results show that our method outperforms the synchronous binarization method <CIT> with over 08 BLEU scores on both NIST 2005 and NIST 2008 Chinese-to-English evaluation data sets '
'<OTH> produced a corpus of 4,000 questions annotated with syntactic trees , and obtained an improvement in parsing accuracy for Bikels reimplementation of the Collins parser <CIT> by training a new parser model with a combination of newspaper and question data '
'1 Introduction Statistical phrase-based systems <CIT> have consistently delivered state-of-the-art performance in recent machine translation evaluations , yet these systems remain weak at handling word order changes '
'With these linguistic annotations , we expect the LABTG to address two traditional issues of standard phrase-based SMT <CIT> in a more effective manner '
'At the same time , we believe our method has advantages over the approach developed initially at IBM <CIT> for training translation systems automatically '
'Despite relying on a the same concept , our approach outperforms BE in most comparisons , and it often achieves higher correlations with human judgments than the string-matching metric ROUGE <CIT> '
'More recent work <OTH> has considered methods for speeding up the feature selection methods described in <CIT> , Ratnaparkhi -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , and Della Pietra , Della Pietra , and Lafferty <OTH> '
'1 Introduction Currently , most of the phrase-based statistical machine translation -LRB- PBSMT -RRB- models <CIT> adopt full matching strategy for phrase translation , which means that a phrase pair -LRB- tildewidef , tildewidee -RRB- can be used for translating a source phrase f , only if tildewidef = f Due to lack of generalization ability , the full matching strategy has some limitations '
'1 Introduction For statistical machine translation -LRB- SMT -RRB- , phrasebased methods <OTH> and syntax-based methods <OTH> outperform word-based methods <CIT> '
'To our knowledge no systems directly address Problem 1 , instead choosing to ignore the problem by using one or a small handful of reference derivations in an n-best list <CIT> , or else making local independence assumptions which side-step the issue <OTH> '
'For example , the statistical word alignment in IBM translation models <CIT> can only handle word to word and multi-word to word alignments '
'Our graphical representation has two advantages over previous work <CIT> : unifying sentence relations and incorporating question interactions '
'<OTH> presented a history-based generation model to overcome some of the inappropriate independence assumptions in the basic generation model of <CIT> '
'Unfortunately , longer sentences -LRB- up to 100 tokens , rather than 40 -RRB- , longer phrases -LRB- up to 10 tokens , rather than 7 -RRB- , two LMs -LRB- rather than just one -RRB- , higher-order LMs -LRB- order 7 , rather than 3 -RRB- , multiple higher-order lexicalized re-ordering models -LRB- up to 3 -RRB- , etc all contributed to increased system ? s complexity , and , as a result , time limitations prevented us from performing minimum-error-rate training -LRB- MERT -RRB- <CIT> for ucb3 , ucb4 and ucb5 '
'Unsupervised methods have been developed for WSD , but despite modest success have not always been well understood statistically <CIT> '
'In addition , uniform conditioning on mother grammatical function is more general than the case-phenomena specific generation grammar transform of <CIT> , in that it applies to each and every sub-part of a recursive input f-structure driving generation , making available relevant generation history -LRB- context -RRB- to guide local generation decisions '
'Section 5 presents an error analysis for <CIT> lexicalized model , which shows that the head-head dependencies used in this model fail to cope well with the flat structures in Negra '
'Even the creators of BLEU point out that it may not correlate particularly well with human judgment at the sentence level <CIT> , a problem also noted by <OTH> and <OTH> '
'Methods like McDonalds , including the wellknown Maximal Marginal Relevance -LRB- MMR -RRB- algorithm <CIT> , are subject to another problem : Summary-level redundancy is not always well modeled by pairwise sentence-level redundancy '
'While other systems , such as <CIT> , have addressed these tasks to some degree , OPINE is the first to report results '
'Thirdly , <CIT> deploys the dependency language model to augment the lexical language model probability be1183 tween two head words but never seek a full dependency graph '
'METEOR was chosen since , unlike the more commonly used BLEU metric <CIT> , it provides reasonably reliable scores for individual sentences '
'Our method is a natural extension of those proposed in <CIT> and <OTH> , and overcomes their drawbacks while retaining their advantages '
'Another consequence of not generating posthead conjunctions and punctuation as first-class words is that they 19 In fact , if punctuation occurs before the head , it is not generated at alla deficiency in the parsing model that appears to be a holdover from the deficient punctuation handling in the model of <CIT> '
'One conclusion that we can draw is that at present the additional word features used in <CIT> looking at words more than one position away from the current do not appear to be helping the overall performance of the models '
'In comparison , the 2D model in Figure 2 -LRB- c -RRB- used in previous work <CIT> can only model the interaction between adjacent questions '
'The problem is typically presented in log-space , which simplifies computations , but otherwise does not change the problem due to the monotonicity of the log function -LRB- hm = log hprimem -RRB- log p -LRB- t s -RRB- = summationdisplay m m hm -LRB- t , s -RRB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- Phrase-based models <CIT> are limited to the mapping of small contiguous chunks of text '
'Though taggers based on dependency networks <OTH> , SVM <OTH> , MaxEnt <CIT> , CRF <OTH> , and other methods may reach slightly better results , their train\/test cycle is orders of magnitude longer '
'Several papers have looked at higher-order representations , but have not examined the equivalence of syn\/para distributions when formalized as Markov chains <CIT> '
'Of the methods we compare against , only the WordNet-based similarity measures , <OTH> , and <CIT> provide a method for predicting verb similarities ; our learned measure widely outperforms these methods , achieving a 136 % F-score improvement over the LESK similarity measure '
'In order to capture the dependency relationship between lexcial heads <CIT> breaks down the rules from head outwards , which prevents us from factorizing them in other ways '
'Besides , our model , as being linguistically motivated , is also more expressive than the formally syntax-based models of Chiang <OTH> and <CIT> '
'String alignment with synchronous grammars is quite expensive even for simple synchronous formalisms like ITG <CIT> but Duchi et al '
'1 Introduction Phrase-based systems , flat and hierarchical alike <CIT> , have achieved a much better translation coverage than wordbased ones <OTH> , but untranslated words remain a major problem in SMT '
'Such a quasi-syntactic structure can naturally capture the reordering of phrases that is not directly modeled by a conventional phrase-based approach <CIT> '
'Although generating training examples in advance without a working parser <OTH> is much faster than using inference <CIT> , our training time can probably be decreased further by choosing a parsing strategy with a lower branching factor '
'This cost can often be substantial , as with the Penn Treebank <CIT> '
'2 Previous work on Sentiment Analysis Some prior studies on sentiment analysis focused on the document-level classification of sentiment <CIT> where a document is assumed to have only a single sentiment , thus these studies are not applicable to our goal '
'Since Czech is a language with relatively high degree of word-order freedom , and its sentences contain certain syntactic phenomena , such as discontinuous constituents -LRB- non-projective constructions -RRB- , which can not be straightforwardly handled using the annotation scheme of Penn Treebank <CIT> , based on phrase-structure trees , we decided to adopt for the PCEDT the dependency-based annotation scheme of the Prague Dependency Treebank PDT <OTH> '
'13 <CIT> give an informal example , but do not elaborate on it '
'Like WASP1 , the phrase extraction algorithm of PHARAOH is based on the output of a word alignment model such as GIZA + + <CIT> , which performs poorly when applied directly to MRLs -LRB- Section 32 -RRB- '
'This restriction is necessary because the problem of optimizing many-to-many alignments 5 Our preliminary experiments with n-gram-based overlap measures , such as BLEU <CIT> and ROUGE <OTH> , show that these metrics do not correlate with human judgments on the fusion task , when tested against two reference outputs '
'Although the authors of <CIT> stated that they would discuss the search problem in a follow-up arti cle , so far there have no publications devoted to the decoding issue for statistical machine translation '
'This strategy is commonly used in MT evaluation , because of BLEUs well-known problems with documents of small size <CIT> '
'Our system improves over the latent named-entity tagging in <CIT> , from 61 % to 87 % '
'The generalized perceptron proposed by <CIT> is closely related to CRFs , but the best CRF training methods seem to have a slight edge over the generalized perceptron '
'2 Previous Work It is helpful to compare this approach with recent efforts in statistical MT Phrase-based models <CIT> are good at learning local translations that are pairs of -LRB- consecutive -RRB- sub-strings , but often insufficient in modeling the reorderings of phrases themselves , especially between language pairs with very different word-order '
'When compared to other kernel methods , our approach performs better than those based on the Tree kernel <CIT> , and is only 02 % worse than the best results achieved by a kernel method for parsing <OTH> '
'Lexical relationships under the standard IBM models <CIT> do not account for many-to-many mappings , and phrase extraction relies heavily on the accuracy of the IBM word-toword alignment '
'Despite ME theory and its related training algorithm <OTH> do not set restrictions on the range of feature functions1 , popular NLP text books <OTH> and research papers <CIT> seem to limit them to binary features '
'4 Conclusions Compared with other word alignment algorithms <CIT> , word_align does not require sentence alignment as input , and was shown to produce useful alignments for small and noisy corpora '
'1 Introduction Statistical phrase-based systems <CIT> have consistently delivered state-of-the-art performance in recent machine translation evaluations , yet these systems remain weak at handling word order changes '
'Our approach not only outperformed a notoriously difficult baseline but also achieved similar performance to the approach of <CIT> , without requiring their third-party data resources '
'While we have shown an increase in performance over a purely syntactic baseline model -LRB- the algorithm of <CIT> -RRB- , there are a number of avenues to pursue in extending this work '
'Presently , there exist methods for learning oppositional terms <CIT> and paraphrase learning has been thoroughly studied , but successfully extending these techniques to learn incompatible phrases poses difficulties because of the data distribution '
'Formal complexity analysis has not been carried out , but my algorithm is simpler , at least conceptually , than the variable-word-order parsers of Johnson <OTH> , <CIT> , and Abramson and Dahl -LRB- 1989 -RRB- '
'These scores are higher than those of several other parsers <CIT> , but remain behind tim scores of Charniak -LRB- 2000 -RRB- who obtains 901 % LP and 901 % LR for sentences _ -LRB- 40 words '
'In contrast to existing approaches <CIT> , the context of the whole corpus rather than a single sentence is considered in this iterative , unsupervised procedure , yielding a more reliable alignment '
'While minimum error training <CIT> has by now become a standard tool for interpolating a small number of aggregate scores , it is not well suited for learning in high-dimensional feature spaces '
'<CIT> and Collins and Duffy -LRB- 2002 -RRB- rerank the top N parses from an existing generative parser , but this kind of approach 1Dynamic programming methods <OTH> can sometimes be used for both training and decoding , but this requires fairly strong restrictions on the features in the model '
'Ever since its introduction in general <OTH> and in computational linguistics <CIT> , many researchers have pointed out that there are quite some problems in using -LRB- eg '
'1 Introduction The dominance of traditional phrase-based statistical machine translation -LRB- PBSMT -RRB- models <CIT> has recently been challenged by the development and improvement of a number of new models that explicity take into account the syntax of the sentences being translated '
'1 Introduction Hierarchical approaches to machine translation have proven increasingly successful in recent years <OTH> , and often outperform phrase-based systems <CIT> on target-language fluency and adequacy '
'While we do not have a direct comparison , we note that <CIT> performs worse on movie reviews than on his other datasets , the same type of data as the polarity dataset '
'At any rate , regularized conditional loglinear models have not previously been applied to the problem of producing a high quality part-of-speech tagger : Ratnaparkhi <OTH> , Toutanova and Manning <OTH> , and <CIT> all present unregularized models '
'The most commonly used metric , BLEU , correlates well over large test sets with human judgments <CIT> , but does not perform as well on sentence-level evaluation <OTH> '
'We will show that some achieve significantly better results than the standard minimum error rate training of <CIT> '
'Allomorphs -LRB- eg , deni and deny -RRB- are also automatically identified in <CIT> , but the general problem of recognizing highly irregular forms is examined more extensively in <OTH> '
'Most recently , <OTH> published their Semi-supervised sequential labeling method , whose results on POS tagging seem to be optically better than <CIT> , but no significance tests were given and the tool is not available for download , ie for repeating the results and significance testing '
'By increasing the size of the basic unit of translation , phrase-based machine translation does away with many of the problems associated with the original word-based formulation of statistical machine translation <CIT> , in particular : The Brown et al '
'<OTH> examine the FS of the weighted log-likelihood ratio -LRB- WLLR -RRB- on the movie review dataset and achieves an accuracy of 871 % , which is higher than the result reported by <CIT> with the same dataset '
'While both <OTH> and <CIT> propose models which use the parameters of the generative model but train to optimize a discriminative criteria , neither proposes training algorithms which are computationally tractable enough to be used for broad coverage parsing '
'Turneys method did not work well although they reported 80 % accuracy in <CIT> '
'<OTH> tried a different generative phrase translation model analogous to IBM word-translation Model 3 <CIT> , and again found that the standard model outperformed their generative model '
'The automatically generated patterns in PairClass are slightly more general than the patterns of <CIT> '
'Although previous work <CIT> has tackled the bootstrapping approach from both the theoretical and practical point of view , many key problems still remain unresolved , such as the selection of initial seed set '
'Unlike <CIT> , who found optimal performance when was approximately 104 , we observed monotonic increases in performance as dropped '
'While these approaches have had som e success to date <CIT> , their usability as parsers in systems for natural language understanding is suspect '
'2 Motivation and Prior Work While several authors have looked at the supervised adaptation case , there are less -LRB- and especially less successful -RRB- studies on semi-supervised domain adaptation <CIT> '
"Unlike more conventional optimization approaches ( ie, single-objective, sequential-objectives or other MO techniques) [7]_CITE, GP offers an adjustable model to real network operation conditions, combining, on the one hand, simplicity of formulation expressing constrains usually as linear/non-linear programming, and, on the other hand, flexibility to compute the optimal solution thanks to simultaneously optimizing the deviations (underachieve/overachieve) of estimations (called goals) about real (domain-driven applications) conditions"
"However, unlike the study carried out by Di Marco et al, authors in [22]_CITE did not report results referred to the computational burden required by the analytical model resolution, especially, in the case in which the number of nodes is big"
"For instance, one case ( Cloke,_2007_CITE) was included, as there were indications of large-scale considerations, although the size remained unclear"
"If there were no indications of size, the paper was excluded, eg ( Miller_and_Haddad,_2012_CITE)."
"To complicate matters, some papers talked about the team in singular when referring to the organization ( Hodgkins_and_Hohmann,_2007_CITE), making it nontrivial to judge whether the organization met the large scale criteria based on the choice of words of the author."
"Further examples on exclusion by the large scale facet were cases with large organizations but only a single team adopting agile ( Fulgham_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Also piloting cases that reported only single teams using agile, even though considering the whole organization would meet the large scale criteria, were excluded, eg ( Scott_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"However, during our initial attempts to apply the PDF estimation method of Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE (hereafter BP11), we discovered that its computational performance is not practicable"
"However, because the Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE method involves a transformation from data-space to Fourier-space (ie, calculation of the empirical characteristic function), the method is quite slow if the empirical characteristic function is calculated using a direct Fourier transform"
"While Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE suggest that their method readily extends to multiple dimensions, special care will be required to develop multidimensional frequency filters (ie, In in Section 2.3), since neither the filter used in this paper nor the filter used by Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE has simple multidimensional analogs."
"Although this leads to a precise operation log ( Mens,_2002_CITE), there are several drawbacks"
"As reported in Brosch_et_al._(2010)_CITE, Herrmannsdoerfer_et_al._(2009)_CITE, Koegel_et_al._(2010)_CITE and Mens_(2008)_CITE, working only on this level does not scale."
"Our method is both more accurate than traditional survey methods [35,59]_CITE in measuring opinion leadership, and more comprehensive than network structure methods [41,43]_CITE"
"However, according to some empirical ( Flores,_Olson,_&_Pearce,_1993_CITE) and analytical research ( Hosoda_&_Disney,_2009_CITE), the most accurate forecasting does not always result in an optimal supply chain when local bullwhip or global inventory costs are taken into account ( Disney,_Lambrecht,_Towill,_&_Van_de_Velde,_2008;_Gaalman,_2006;_Gaalman_&_Disney,_2006;_Gaalman_&_Disney,_2009_CITE)."
"Though some results have been derived in [34]_CITE, they only cover a very weak form of stability, which states that the solutions of (2) with perturbed data stay close to the solution with unperturbed data, if one additionally increases the regularization parameter in the perturbed problem by a sufficient amount."
"Similar, but weaker, results have been already been derived in [5,28,61]_CITE in the context of Tikhonov regularization"
"In line with recent research showing that there are no gender differences regarding perception and decision about technology adoption within younger subjects [44]_CITE, we did not find significant impact."
"Traditionally, persistent data is still stored using hard disk drives (HDD) [21]_CITE with all the disadvantages which they have, such as boundaries on their access times, a lifetime limited by mechanical (moving) parts, and DRAM (volatile memory) with faster access"
"For brevity, the present paper does not discuss these once-mentioned limitations in the evaluation of the experiment presented in Jiang_et_al._(2009)_CITE."
"Indeed, there is no innovation ( Jackson,_2012_CITE, n.p.)"
"Previous research ( McCay-Peet_et_al.,_2014_CITE) had been unable to deduce whether the Highlights Trigger and Trigger-Rich facets were confounded or simply correlated"
"Enables Exploration, a proposed facet of the serendipitous digital environment ( McCay-Peet_et_al.,_2014_CITE) did not emerge as a distinct factor"
"We discovered that the natural language output version was more satisfying to climate scientists than version A and that they executed tasks up to twice as fast on the natural language output SUI (Gibbs,_2013)_CITE"
"Existing approaches for enforcement of Android security policies are either hard-coded interfaces with a limited set of enforcement options ( Beresford_et al.,_2011;_Zhou_et al.,_2011_CITE), or flexible and fine-grain approaches using a security policy specification language focusing on low level actions (eg API invocations or system calls) ( Rasthofer_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"In contrast to the refinement rules proposed in Neisse_and_Doerr_CITE (2013), our extension considers also the modification of events in addition to only allowing or denying the execution of activities"
A very similar approach with slightly less control on private information is introduced by Beresford_et al._(2011)_CITE in their solution named MockDroid
"More similar to our approach Cotterell_et al._(2015)_CITE introduce a solution to enable users to install policies for controlling sensitive data; however, the policies are not based on access to sensitive resources"
"Empirical studies showed that, by integrating the advantages of different EAs into one framework, PAP not only provides practitioners a unified approach for solving his/her problem set, but also may lead to better performance than a single EA [17]_CITE."
"In addition, some benchmarking studies have been undertaken to empirically compare the performance of these various techniques (eg, Baesens_et_al.,_2003_CITE), but they did not focus specifically on how these techniques compare on heavily imbalanced samples, or to what extent any such comparison is affected by the issue of class imbalance"
"First, unlike the method in [11]_CITE that focuses on particular affine regions, our method considers all pixels to have the same importance"
"Second, image invariants are not explicitly handled as in [11,15,16]_CITE, although the symmetry of the connectivity index together with the multiscale approach used allows the quantification of such invariants and simplify the analysis where such invariants are not relevant, for example, if there is no significant variation or when objects at different scales or rotated should actually be considered as different instances"
"A third difference to other methods such as those in [8,14,17]_CITE is that despite the importance of pixel-level descriptions, our approach does not use directly the grey values of the pixels or basic relations between neighbour pixels"
In KTH-TIPS2b the classification performance was also better than that reported in [16]_CITE (76%) using a similar database and protocol.
a more generalized Modal-LID3 algorithm (compared to [33]_CITE) to account for non-linear output functions;
"In general, problem-oriented research is rather underrepresented in literature ( Lam_et al.,_2012;_McKenna_et al.,_2015,_2016;_Pirker_and_Nusser,_2016;_Sedlmair_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"However, none of these approaches covered the full set of requirements as specified by Wagner_et al._(2014)_CITE during their problem characterization and abstraction"
"Concerning the characteristics of spatial language, Hubona et al [21]_CITE provide support for the cognitive fit theory in terms of decision accuracy but not in terms of time"
"Therefore, the consideration of fuzziness is superior to that of Chen [7]_CITE"
"This fact implies that it is not necessary to use a partitioning tool, such as METIS [14]_CITE, to carry out a deep analysis of the matrix to determine the subdomain partition"
"To the best of our knowledge, Theodoros et al [13]_CITE discuss the only team composition approach that specifically focuses on the expert network for determining the most suitable team"
"No model is available which is valid for a wider range of flow situations [7,8]_CITE"
It can be concluded that the zero parameter model by Angelidou et al [25]_CITE predicts a reasonable but not perfect distribution of enstrophy.
The algorithm was proved to be very competitive and outperformed our energy-based method and the method proposed by del_Solar_and_Verschae_(2004)_CITE
"With local search algorithms ( Arcuri,_2009_CITE) one only considers the neighborhood of a candidate solution"
"Harman_and_McMinn_(2010)_CITE recently determined that global search is more effective than local search, but less efficient, as it is more costly"
"This may seem in slight contrast to the results of our initial experiments in Fraser_et al._(2013)_CITE, where the best result was achieved with seeding, small population size (5), low rate of local search (every 75 generations), and a small budget (5) for local search"
"At any rate, one problem with parameter tuning is that, given a large set of experiments from which we choose the best configuration, such a configuration could be too specific for the employed case study ( Arcuri_and_Fraser,_2013_CITE)"
"In contrast, the Carfast ( Park_et al.,_2012_CITE) case study is devoid of such environmental dependencies, but still consists of a set of automatically generated software projects that are intended to be realistic"
"Alternatively, such techniques utilise automated conversational agents ( Huber_et al.,_2009_CITE), which do not scale and are not very effective due to the challenges of imitating human conversational behaviour"
"Solutions to detect such sophisticated attacks are emerging ( Aggarwal_et al.,_2014_CITE), but still fall short of successfully detecting against sophisticated text-based attacks."
The performance of our estimated model is reasonable in the sense that it is able to correctly estimate rhythmic motion unlike silhouette-based estimation as reported by Rosenhahn et al [2]_CITE: lack of information to correctly estimate the silhouette of the object
Other existing approaches that generate the configurations at runtime [15 20]_CITE also have limitations in mobile environments as usually most of them demand high computing resources
"Finally, the average adaptation time of our approach is considerably lower than the reported in [19]_CITE."
"On the other hand, the proposal of Benavides et al [38]_CITE always finds the optimal configuration using Constraint Satisfaction Problems with exponential-time complexity, making it unsuitable for runtime optimization."
"In max plus (tropical) convexity, such interpretation also involves the notion of tropical cellular decomposition [6]_CITE, whose max min analogue is still unknown"
"While it is possible to embed the detection of sensor noise in low-level networks ( Parisi_et_al.,_2015_CITE), it is non-trivial to detect inaccurate samples that belong to the feature space, eg caused by the (self-)occlusion of body joints"
"Although this approach yields the reliable recognition of a set of action words ( Twiefel_et_al.,_2014_CITE), it has the disadvantage that a specific set of words has to be defined a priori"
"These aspects have indeed been neglected by prior computational models of mental rotation (eg, Inui_&_Ashizawa,_2011;_Sasama_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Although cognitive robotics models of mental simulation have been recently proposed ( Di_Nuovo,_De_La_Cruz,_&_Marocco,_2013_CITE), these do not directly address mental rotation capabilities, but rather mental simulation for motor planning tasks"
"They also do not propose hypotheses on the brain mechanisms that may underlie them (eg, Di_Nuovo,_Marocco,_Cangelosi,_De_La_Cruz,_&_Di_Nuovo,_2012_CITE)"
"The architecture we proposed and its functioning mechanisms represent a further step with respect to previous computational models (eg, Inui_&_Ashizawa,_2011_CITE; Sasama_et al.,_2009_CITE) as these focused on mental rotation mechanisms without relating them to the other supporting processes such as matching processes and decision making processes ( Lamm_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
"The architecture also represents an innovation with respect to previous neuro-robotic models ( Seepanomwan_et al.,_2013a,_2013b_CITE) that did not distinguish between the brain areas possibly performing visual and proprioceptive processes and also used abstract monitoring and decision making mechanisms."
"A second innovation of the model in comparison to other neuro-robotic models ( Seepanomwan_et al.,_2013a,_2013b_CITE), shared with other neural-network models (eg, Sasama_et al.,_2009_CITE), involves a more general rotation process capable of rotating different, possibly novel objects (to the condition that these are represented in terms of edges)"
"Mechanisms as simple and general as these might be used to inspire other planning strategies to solve manipulation problems involving a low number of actions, eg not only rotations ( Ciancio,_Zollo,_Baldassarre,_Caligiore,_&_Guglielmelli,_2013;_Meola_et al.,_in press_CITE) but also linear translations in open space and 3D mental rotations."
"Nevertheless, there has been some lack of clarity in the risk field regarding what this concept means; compare, for example, Reinert_and_Apostolakis_(2006),_Park,_Amarchinta,_and_Grandhi_(2010),_Droguett_and_Mosleh_(2013,_2014_CITE) and Aven_and_Zio_(2013)_CITE"
"Few policies for risk management have created more controversy than the precautionary principle, and it is still being discussed; see for example Aven_(2011b),_Cox_(2011),_Lofstedt_(2003),_Sunstein_(2005),_Peterson_(2006),_Renn_(2008)_CITE) and Aldred_(2013)_CITE"
"However, even with the most expensive commercial mocap systems, there are still instances where noise and missing data are inevitable [1,3,18,21]_CITE"
"Meanwhile, the prevalence of some novel yet cheap mocap sensors (eg, Microsoft Kinect), which are able to capture human motion in real-time but whose outputs are not very accurate especially when significant occlusions occur, makes the mocap data refinement problem much more pertinent and important [13,45,48,54,60]_CITE."
"The data-driven methods often suffer from the out-of-sample problem [4,5,37]_CITE"
"However, they are off-line methods and only efficient for handling missing values for a very short period of time, typically less than 0.5 [1]_CITE"
"The method [31]_CITE, however, has to rely on the existence of other markers on the same segment to make inter-marker distance measurement possible [4]_CITE."
"Compared with [23]_CITE, our model does not only take the low-rank structure property into account but also the temporal stability property of motion data and noise effect"
Another significant difference between our model and its counterpart in [23]_CITE is that we do not need to guess the standard deviation of the noise which is used for solving the de-noising model in [23]_CITE
"In Section 4, we also have observed that our method is not only faster than the work [23]_CITE but also outperforms it in the experiments on both synthetic and real data"
SVT [23]_CITE only exploits the low-rank structure of motion data and cannot handle the cases where markers are missing for a long period of time
"From the last two columns of each sub-image in Fig_11, the shortcoming of SVT [23]_CITE is shown that it is unable to correctly predict some missing values"
"However, when some markers are missing for a long period of time, Dynammo [30]_CITE also fails to correctly predict the missing values"
"More importantly, our method is faster than Dynammo [30]_CITE and SVT [23]_CITE most of the time as shown in Fig_13"
"Therefore in Fig_9(k) and (f), SVT [30]_CITE is unable to correctly refine such a large-scale motion data, as opposed to our method, as shown in Fig_9(k) and (f), which demonstrates the robustness of our method."
"Our network has a maximum delivery capacity of 351 mega standard cubic meters, while the largest daily delivery from NCS in 2011 was 361 mega standard cubic meters (Gassco,_2011)_CITE"
"Indeed, we provide clear evidence that online forums afford users a way of being genuinely together, together , as opposed to what Turkle_(2012)_CITE calls alone together"
"Unlike the translation algorithm described in Sirin et al [27]_CITE which translates only the preconditions of atomic processes into the preconditions of SHOP2 operators, Translate-Atomic-Process( Q) translates both the preconditions and inputs of atomic processes into the preconditions of SHOP2 operators"
"Similarly, unlike the translation algorithm described in Sirin et al [27]_CITE which translates only the effects of atomic processes into the post-conditions of SHOP2 operators, Translate-Atomic-Process( Q) translates both the effects and outputs of atomic processes into the post-conditions of SHOP2 operators"
"Unlike the proposed approach described above, the approach by Sirin et al [27]_CITE does not combine operators to form a method"
SHOP2 does not support concurrency [27]_CITE and hence it cannot create parallel workflows
However Musman_et al._(2011)_CITE fails to get across any mathematical approaches or formal definitions for impact assessment.
"For example, Goodall_et al._(2009)_CITE focus on modeling and available data integration using ontologies but do not address an impact assessment"
"However, presented probability theory in Chung_et al._(2013)_CITE is not sound and voids fundamental principles of probabilistic inference in multiply connected graphs"
"Other impact propagation approaches, eg, by Kheir_et al._(2009)_CITE or Jahnke_et al._(2007)_CITE, claiming to handle details such as disagreeing information sources and cycles, are not probabilistic based and degrade to a handcrafted propagation algorithm with arbitrary scores, where parameters are only assessable by deeply trained experts and obtained results can only be used in a holistic way, as they provide no directly interpretable meaning"
"This is a general advantage of computationally formulated models, but is especially useful for spatial memory models, since experiments investigating spatial cognition using the classical, iterative cycle of hypothesis formulation, prediction derivation and testing ( Godfrey-Smith,_2003_CITE) usually require multiple, sometimes large environments (especially for navigation-scale spatial memory), and are thus impractical and time consuming to perform in the real world"
"Unlike ( Burgess_et al.,_2000_CITE), this model includes full visual processing, not just distance measurements to boundaries"
"Models with high biological realism (SNNs, eg McNaughton_et al.,_1996_CITE; or Erdem_&_Hasselmo,_2012_CITE) usually have trouble handling highly complex real-world environments (due mainly to their high computational demands, but also to the observation that it is easier to model high-level cognitive tasks such as planning with simpler such as symbolic models)"
"Overall, our research advances Sun_and_Tse's_(2009_CITE) model of platform competition by emphasizing that multi-homing can manifest differently within a single group of actors in the market"
"Third, based on our empirical findings, we question the number-driven success metrics employed to evaluate mobile application ecosystems (eg, Gupta,_2012;_Reuters,_2012_CITE)"
"First, we have advanced the model of Sun_and_Tse_(2009)_CITE on the influence of multi-homing in platform competition in two-sided markets in order to capture the characteristics of mobile application ecosystems"
Forecast assessments based on scoring rules have been heavily criticised because different rules may provide different conclusions about the forecasting capability of football forecast models [4]_CITE
"Any thorough book or literature review on genre, such as Freedman_&_Medway_(1994)_and_Paltridge_(1997)_CITE will divulge an overall lack of consensus on an appropriate definition of genre because so many questions remain unanswered with regard to how genres are replaced, created, evolve, function, overlap and interact with each other, which rules and patterns constitute a genre and how these characteristics are perceived"
"For instance, WordNet::Similarity [99]_CITE and WS4J [121]_CITE were designed before the emergence of the intrinsic IC models described in section 2.1, thus, these libraries maintain in-memory tables with the concept frequency counts which are interrogated in order to compute the IC values required in a similarity evaluation step; however, their data structures does not provide any proper abstraction layer or software architecture to integrate new intrinsic IC models easily"
"For example, Zhou et al [134]_CITE define the root depth as 1, whilst the standard convention in graph theory is 0"
"In a recent work [57]_CITE, we find some contradictory results and difficulties in replicating previous methods and experiments reported in the literature"
"These reproducibility problems were confirmed in another subsequent work, such as [56]_CITE, whilst new contradictory results are reported in [58]_CITE"
"Finally, despite one of the main motivations of WNetSS being to provide a software implementation for the most recent methods, looking at tables 2 and 3, you can see that WNetSS [15]_CITE neither implements nor cites many recent similarity measures and IC models reported in the literature."
"However, the synchronization process itself is not implemented using balanced excitation and inhibition among IF cells as in Hopfield_and_Brody_(2001)_CITE, but is rather described at the level of phase dynamics"
"ASR based on cepstral coefficients, for example, requires an additional Dynamic Time Warping or Hidden Markov Modelling stage ( Rabiner_&_Juang,_1993_CITE)"
"Unlike the previous study [66]_CITE, we analyze a significantly wider range of obstacle factors, including not only the traditionally discussed technical challenges such as reliability and QoS, but also various other factors, including heterogeneity and scale, and inhomogeneous distribution of resources among users"
The requirement of independent deployment of components entailed by the definition by Szyperski_(2002)_CITE is currently not a core requirement for us (and neither is in many other component-oriented approaches)
"In the parallel case, although widely used, the PRAM [30]_CITE model is unrealistic because it assumes all processors work synchronously and that interprocessor communication is free"
"Our definition refines Genet's concept of compatibility [7]_CITE, allowing better (ie, smaller) approximations of reachable terms in some cases"
"For example, whereas [5]_CITE only mentions the application areas in passing, we now provide many more details in Sections 5 and 6"
"But the question of importance is what was known about repulsor (or repellor) in the Lorenz system and the dynamics of time-reversal Lorenz system before the works [12,61]_CITE were published? Note that in [2,3]_CITE there is no discussion of the following important questions for the consideration of the Lorenz system in the backward time or with non positive parameters: the existence of the extension of solutions, the existence of attractors, and the possibility of consideration of invariant sets in the backward time"
"Also an invariant algebraic surface in the Chen system with c=0 (see, eg, [18,59]_CITE) has not correspondence with the Lorenz system [2]_CITE."
"Unfortunately, such a relation is not computable ( Weiser,_1984_CITE)"
"We have tried several clustering and visualization tools to cluster the is-in-the-slice-of graph for comparison, but most of the tools (such as Gephi Bastian_et_al.,_2009_CITE) failed due to the large dataset"
"Other tools such as CCVisu ( Beyer,_2008_CITE) which were able to handle the large data set simply produced a blob as a visualization which was not at all useful"
"In the present paper, we avoid the use of some simplifications considered in [12]_CITE and propose an original methodology to deduce a family of models that take into account the pressure dependence of viscosity, by solving the problem defined by Eqs"
"However, the small data and non negativity of dh/dt assumptions in [17]_CITE are very far from conditions in the present situation"
"In this paper, a rigorous methodology to include piezoviscosity previously to the limit procedures to obtain a Reynolds model has been developed, overcoming a simplification hypothesis considered in [12]_CITE"
We are not able to determine whether these 13 articles are also reported in the study by Chen_et_al._(2012)_CITE; we suspect that at least some are.
"However, the demise of the scientific methodology may be somewhat exaggerated, as argued in the many ripostes to the article (eg Dyson_et_al.,_2008;_Granville,_2013_CITE)"
"This cautiousness assumption is absent from [73]_CITE, in which it is assumed (like in the AGM revision setting) that the inputs Ei underlie more information than what is explicitly represented, under the form of weak plausibility orders i, so that f(E1,E2)=A B where A (resp"
"Liberatore and Schaerf [73]_CITE also mention Information Monotonicity, albeit without the restriction to consistent inputs, thus getting trivialisation results."
"When parallel fusion is taken for granted (see for instance [24]_CITE), the result is often required to be a weighted average of original probabilities"
"First, the complexity in selecting constraint parameters, structuring elements, cost functions, etc., was quite high in [5,15]_CITE"
"Second, the initial regional minima was manually defined as highly related to the over segmentation issue in [14,15]_CITE, and thus the applicability to different microscopic image data, eg, other data of PCD, is uncertain"
"From Table 4, we can see that the average rate obtained by CDF-DRVC/GP-EM is higher than that obtained by HROIT/GP-EM [37 38]_CITE, with an improved average rate of 4.3%; the CDF-DRVC/GP-EM also yields a lower Std of 2.39%, compared with a Std of 3.50% obtained by HROIT/GP-EM in the ten-fold cross-validation"
"These challenges are not reported in the recent Systematic Literature Review (SLR) ( Laukkanen_et_al.,_2017_CITE), which systematically reviewed the existing literature to identity problems and solutions in adopting CD."
"Our previous work ( Chen,_2015_CITE) did not include any of the strategies reported in this paper"
"The flow physics for these is complex and transitional [13]_CITE, where RANS modeling will be highly unreliable"
"Our algorithm can compute the positively weighted straight skeleton of a monotone polygon in O(nlog n) time and O(n) space, which constitutes a significant improvement over the O(n17/11+ ) worst-case time and space complexity of the currently best algorithm for arbitrary simple polygons by Eppstein and Erickson [2]_CITE"
"(The algorithm by Vigneron and Yan [7]_CITE achieves an expected O(n4/3log n) time complexity but is only applicable if no multi-split events occur.) Furthermore, our algorithm does not require complex data structures and is easy to implement."
"Whereas, in the outer surf zone, the wave height is under-predicted by approximately 5% with respect to the one-dimensional model of Musumeci et al [22]_CITE"
"We can conclude that the UAW also has an effect on size estimation, which is different than the findings published previously in Ochodek_et al.,_(2011b)_CITE"
"Warburton_et_al._(2007)_CITE propose reflection on context, purposes and methods, but they do not consider the implications of the researcher role in the situation"
"Unlike the model introduced by Gonz lez-Manteiga_et al._(2008b)_CITE with a common random effect for all the components of the target variable, the new models have multivariate vectors of random effects with the same dimension as the target variable and allowing for different correlation structures"
Datta_et al._(2002)_CITE conclusions were thus restricted to their case of study
This definition is critically discussed in [105]_CITE
"Unfortunately, software project retrospectives are often neglected ( Dyb _et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"However, the effect for learning has been claimed to be valid only if the prior knowledge on the problem is low ( Mayer_and_Gallini,_1990_CITE)"
"Another problem of the fishbone diagram is a tree structure ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Furthermore, the retrospective outcome and the perceptions of participants utilizing a structural list have rarely been compared with the use of CED ( St lhane,_2004;_St lhane_et_al.,_2003_CITE)"
"We assumed that in the context of software engineering, using that technique makes the analysis difficult, because of the high number of detected causes ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"However, comparison between the fishbone diagram and the directed graph ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE) is not enough for determining the effectiveness of using the structural list, because the fishbone diagram utilizes different visual structure than the structural list."
"Instead, they have only considered the learning efficiency from a premade knowledge, eg, learning how the blood vessel is functioning ( Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003_CITE)."
"The prior studies have also failed to address the questions whether the use of CED outperforms textual notations formulated as a structural list ( Ammerman,_1998_CITE) during the RCA of retrospectives"
"However, as in Kumar_et al._(2009_CITE), only the software algorithms are applicable to ABCs because the hardware used was not described"
"As the approach in ( Walther_and_W rtz,_2009_CITE) their work is limited to movements in the 2D image plane"
"Thus in this setting, taking into account (62), it is possible to see that the hypotheses of Theorem 4.1 are satisfied, but the corresponding classical result, that is when F=Fcofin (see also [9,_Corollary_4]_CITE), does not hold."
"These theoretical results suggest that, contrary to Clark_and_Squire_(1998)_CITE, episodic memory may not be necessary to consciously experience emotions"
"However, the uniqueness theorem mentioned in [51]_CITE (Theorem 3.2, Chapter IV) cannot be applied directly to our model as ( i) it applies only for a one-dimensional process and ( ii) the coefficients b(x):R R and (x):R R of the SDE mentioned in this theorem are purely deterministic functions not time dependent stochastic functions"
We cannot use Theorem 2.4 in Chapter IV of [51]_CITE directly to do this as the solution does not satisfy condition (2.18) there
"The reason is that the Milstein method is strongly convergent with order 1 as the integration time-step goes to zero, which is better than the Euler Maruyama method which only has a convergence order of 0.5 [53]_CITE"
"Dyson treatment of this is relatively short, at just one 18-page chapter [1]_CITE"
LineSets were introduced to overcome problems associated with visual clutter that is seen in Euler diagrams [3]_CITE
"An early attempt to combine sets and networks in a single visualization relied on first drawing an Euler diagram then placing a graph inside it [30]_CITE, however the sets were often visualized with convoluted, difficult to follow curves"
Compound graphs can be used to represent restricted kinds of grouped network data [8]_CITE
"One found Bubble Sets outperformed LineSets [24]_CITE whereas another found that KelpFusion outperformed LineSets which, in turn, outperformed Bubble Sets [28]_CITE"
"In Kertzner_et al._(2006)_CITE, only a brief description of several risk assessment methodologies for the oil and gas sector is outlined"
"In some instances, a method is not demonstrated in full, only some activities within the method are dealt with in a case study (eg Roy_et al.,_2010_CITE) In three proposals ( Chittester_and_Haimes,_2004;_Permann_and_Rohde,_2005;_Yu_et al.,_2006_CITE) no discussion of a method evaluation was found"
"In Kriaa_et al._(2012)_CITE, the method is said to enable a coarse quantification of the attack success probability , but it is not validated whether the quantification suggested is accurate enough to back up security decisions."
"The proof is often limited to the statements like in McQueen_et al._(2006)_CITE saying that the formulas suggested have intuitive meaning for the analysts, testers, and control system users and are clear, reasonably intuitive, and sufficiently well-defined to guide the analysis of the proposed method"
"However, a repair schedule with the minimum length of time is not always the most efficient in supporting subsequent relief operations [21]_CITE, and more comprehensive criteria are required for properly evaluating solutions to the complex problem."
"Experiment shows the proposed method is superior to the basic EP, GA, and differential evolution (DE) [62]_CITE in convergence speed and solution accuracy."
"In the case of linear equations this method bears a close relationship to the method of separation of variables and, in fact, this method produces a large supply of separable solutions for linear equations and it is more algorithmic and more general than the classical Lie method [2 4]_CITE."
"Even though concepts such as social debt ( Tamburri et al,_2013_CITE) and people debt ( Alves et al,_2014_CITE) describe similar phenomena of having shortcuts and non-optimal solutions in software development and organization, we believe that they should be categorized as sources for TD rather than as actual TD"
"These papers, however, concentrate on specific subsystems of Large Scale Distributed Systems, such as [11]_CITE on the performance of memory systems, or only deal with one or two specific SLA parameters"
"Also the VCONF model by Rao et al [16]_CITE has similar goals as presented in Section 1, but depends on specific parameters, can only execute one action per iteration and it neglects the energy consumption of executed actions"
"Thirdly, commercial Cloud IaaS platforms such as Amazon EC2 [29]_CITE, Rackspace [30]_CITE or RightScale [31]_CITE have a very limited choice of preconfigured and static VM resource provisioning types"
"Current monitoring systems (eg, ganglia [35]_CITE) facilitate monitoring only of low-level systems resources, such as free_disk or packets_sent, but SLA parameters typically are, eg, storage and outgoing bandwidth"
"As opposed to the CBR approach in [7]_CITE, the rule-based approach is able to fire more than one action at the same iteration, which inherently increases the flexibility of the system"
"For example, Support Vector Machines (SVM) [33]_CITE, that are employed in many applicative domains [3,4,13,24]_CITE, really become intractable and computationally too expensive when huge data sets are handled [32]_CITE"
"However, other techniques are not feasible with very large data set because they work: (1) by modifying cost for misclassified patterns belonging to the minority class, without changing the number of original data [7]_CITE, (2) by increasing the total number of examples by copying patterns from the minority class to balance the ratio of classes ( oversampling method) [9]_CITE, (3) by combining oversampling and undersampling techniques [34]_CITE."
"However, with the approach of Hirsch_(2010_CITE) and Hirsch_et al._(2008_CITE), debugging of automation software directly inside the SysML model is not provided"
"Conventional robust preview control, which has been studied in [5 9]_CITE, is restricted to small ranges of variations"
"However, accurate unsteady simulations, involving a given geometry and a number of flow parameters [1]_CITE, often require so much cpu time to sweep the parameter space that they have limited impact on the design cycle"
Computing the POD mode coefficients requires the evaluation of integrals over the entire computational domain and this can be a computationally expensive task for large problems [2]_CITE
"Although a similar technique was successfully used by Qamar and Sanghi [19]_CITE, the approach does not appear to have been widely adopted as an alternative to projection techniques"
"This could be a significant issue in many practical problems, such as shape optimisation, where the number of parameters involved can be very large [20]_CITE"
"POD coefficient interpolation type techniques, as introduced by Ly and Tran [11]_CITE, have not been widely adopted as an alternative to projection type techniques"
"In contrast to Sivaraman_et al._(2016)_CITE; Mittal_et al._(2016)_CITE, our research findings show that a chain of NFs requires a global scheduler to make chain-level decisions, rather than an internal scheduler that executes local switch policies"
"These problems were discussed in earlier work ( Rizzo,_2012_CITE), but without much evidence; thus one of our contributions is proving this evidence."
"There is not enough information in Jacob_et al._(2009)_CITE, Lochard_and_Schneider_(1992)_CITE to estimate and"
