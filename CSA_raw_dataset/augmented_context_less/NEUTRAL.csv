'Note that it is straightforward to calculate these expected counts using a variant of the inside-outside algorithm <OTH> applied to the <OTH> dependency-parsing data structures <OTH> for projective dependency structures , or the matrix-tree theorem <CIT> for nonprojective dependency structures '
'Following <CIT> , we consider an anaphoric reference , NPi , correctly resolved if NPi and its closest antecedent are in the same coreference chain in the resulting partition '
'This algorithm adjusts the log-linear weights so that BLEU <CIT> is maximized over a given development set '
'We discriminatively trained our parser in an on-line fashion using a variant of the voted perceptron <CIT> '
'In fact , we found that it doesnt do so badly at all : the bitag HMM estimated by EM achieves a mean 1-to1 tagging accuracy of 40 % , which is approximately the same as the 413 % reported by <CIT> for their sophisticated MRF model '
'2 Motivation and Prior Work While several authors have looked at the supervised adaptation case , there are less -LRB- and especially less successful -RRB- studies on semi-supervised domain adaptation <CIT> '
'There are other types of variations for phrases ; for example , insertion , deletion or substitution of words , and permutation of words such as view point and point of view are such variations <OTH> '
'? ? search engines : <CIT> uses the Altavista web browser , while we consider and combine the frequency information acquired from three web search engines '
'Many methods have been proposed to measure the co-occurrence relation between two words such as 2 <OTH> , mutual information <OTH> , t-test <OTH> , and loglikelihood <CIT> '
'It has been argued that the reliability of a coding schema can be assessed only on the basis of judgments made by naive coders <CIT> '
'to the pair-wise TER alignment described in <CIT> '
'We obtain aligned parallel sentences and the phrase table after the training of Moses , which includes running GIZA + + <OTH> , grow-diagonal-final symmetrization and phrase extraction <CIT> '
'From the above discussion , we can see that traditional tree sequence-based method uses single tree as translation input while the forestbased model uses single sub-tree as the basic translation unit that can only learn tree-to-string <CIT> rules '
'Our baseline method for ambiguity resolution is the Collins parser as implemented by Bikel <CIT> '
'We then built separate English-to-Spanish and Spanish-to-English directed word alignments using IBM model 4 <OTH> , combined them using the intersect + grow heuristic <CIT> , and extracted phrase-level translation pairs of maximum length 7 using the alignment template approach <CIT> '
'For instance , both Pang and Lee <OTH> and <CIT> <OTH> consider the thumbs up\/thumbs down decision : is a film review positive or negative ? '
'Binarizing the syntax trees for syntax-based machine translation is similar in spirit to generalizing parsing models via markovization <CIT> '
'4 Options from the Translation Table Phrase-based statistical machine translation methods acquire their translation knowledge in form of large phrase translation tables automatically from large amounts of translated texts <CIT> '
'For example , <CIT> collected reviews from a movie database and rated them as positive , negative , or neutral based on the rating -LRB- eg , number of stars -RRB- given by the reviewer '
'The earliest work in this direction are those of <OTH> , <OTH> , <OTH> , <OTH> , <OTH> and <CIT> '
'<CIT> established that it is important to tune -LRB- the trade-off between Precision and Recall -RRB- to maximize performance '
'Moreover , under this view , SMT becomes quite similar to sequential natural language annotation problems such as part-of-speech tagging and shallow parsing , and the novel training algorithm presented in this paper is actually most similar to work on training algorithms presented for these task , eg the on-line training algorithm presented in <OTH> and the perceptron training algorithm presented in <CIT> '

'A number of alignment techniques have been proposed , varying from statistical methods <CIT> to lexical methods <OTH> '
'Even though there are some studies that compare the results from statistically computed association measures with word association norms from psycholinguistic experiments <CIT> there has not been any research on the usage of a digital , network-based dictionary reflecting the organization of the mental lexicon to our knowledge '
'Finally , we use as a feature the mappings produced in <CIT> of WordNet senses to Oxford English Dictionary senses '
'3 Semantic Representation 31 The Need for Dependencies Perhaps the most common representation of text for assessing content is Bag-Of-Words or Bag-of-NGrams <CIT> '
'First , we adopt an ONTOLOGICALLY PROMISCUOUS representation <CIT> that includes a wide variety of types of entities '
'For each training direction , we run GIZA + + <CIT> , specifying 5 iterations of Model 1 , 4 iterations of the HMM model <OTH> , and 4 iterations of Model 4 '

'The first solution might also introduce errors elsewhere As <CIT> already noted : ` While this automatic derivation process introduced a small percentage of errors on its own , it was the only practical way both to provide the amount of training data required and to allow for fully-automatic testing '' '

',.~.eqmvalent ot duty in a parallel French text, the correct sense of the Enghsh word is identified These studies exploit th~s lnformatmn m order to gather co-occurrence data for the different senses, which ts then used to dtsamb~guate new texts In related work, Dywk (1998) used patterns of translational relatmns in an EnghshNorwegian paralle ! corpus (ENPC, Oslo Umverslty) to define semantic propemes such as synonymy, ambtgmty, vagueness, and semantic helds and suggested a derivation otsemantic representations for signs (eg, lexemes), captunng semantm relatmnshlps such as hyponymy etc, fiom such translatmnal relatmns Recently, Resnlk and Yarowsky (1997) suggested that fol the purposes ot WSD, the different senses of a wo~d could be detelmlned by considering only sense d~stmctmns that are lextcahzed cross-hngmstlcally In particular, they propose that some set of target languages be ~dent~fied, and that the sense d~stmctmns to be considered for language processing appllcatmns and evaluatmn be restricted to those that are reahzed lexlcally in some minimum subset of those languages This idea would seem to p~ovtde an answer, at least m part, to the problem of determining different senses of a word mtumvely, one assumes that ff another language lexlcahzes a word m two or more ways, there must be a conceptual monvatmn If we look at enough languages, we would be likely to fred the s~gmficant lexlcal differences that dehmtt different senses of a word However, th~s suggestmn raises several questions Fo~ instance, ~t ~s well known that many amb~gumes are preserved across languages (for example, the French tntdrYt and the Enghsh interest), especmlly languages that are relatively closely related Assuming this problem can be overcome, should differences found m closely related languages be given lesser (or greater) weight than those found m more distantly related languages 9 More generally, which languages should be considered for this exermse 9 All languages 9 Closely related languages9 Languages from different language famlhes ''~ A mixture of the two 9 How many languages, and of which types, would be ''enough'' to provide adequate lnfotmanon tot this purpose~ There ts also the questmn ot the crlterm that would be used to estabhsh that a sense distinction is ''lexlcahzed cross-hngu~stmally'' How consistent must the d~stlnCtlOn be 9 Does it mean that two concepts are expressed by mutually non-lntetchangeable lexmal items in some slgmficant number ot other languages, or need tt only be the case that the option ot a different lexlcahzatlon exists m a certain percentage of cases 9 Another conslderatmn ts where the cross-hngual mformatlon to answer these questmns would come from Using bdmgual dictionaries would be extremely tedmus and error-prone, g~ven the substantial d~vergence among d~ctlonanes in terms of the kinds and degree of sense dlstmctmns they make Resmk and Yalowsky (1997) suggest EutoWordNet (Vossen, 1998) as a possible somce of mformatmn, but, given that EuroWordNet ts pttmatdy a lexmon and not a corpus, ~t is subject to many of the same objections as for bl-hngual dictionaries An alternative would be to gather the reformation from parallel, ahgned corpma Unlike bilingual and muttt-hngual dictionaries, translatmn eqmvalents xn parallel texts a~e determined by experienced translatols, who evaluate each instance ot a word''s use m context rather than as a part of the meta-hngmst~c actlvlty of classifying senses for mclusmn in a dictionary However, at present very few parallel ahgned corpora exist The vast majority ot these are bl-texts, mvolwng only two languages, one of which is very often English Ideally, a serious 53 evaluation of Resnik and Yarowsky''s proposal would include parallel texts m languages from several different language families, and, to maximally ensure that the word m question is used in the exact same sense across languages, ~t would be preferable that the same text were used over all languages in the study The only currently avadable parallel corpora for more than two languages are Olwell''s Nmeteen Eighty-Four (Erjavec and Ide, 1998), Plato''s Repubhc (Erjavec, et al, 1998), the MULTEXT Journal .o/ the Commt.~ston corpus (Ide and V6roms, 1994), and the Bible (Resnlk, et al, m press) It is likely that these corpora do not provide enough appropriate data to reliably determine sense distinctions Also, ~t Is not clear how the lexlcahzatlon of sense distractions across languages Is affected by genre, domain, style, etc Thls paper attempts to provide some prehmlnary answers to the questions outhned above, In order to eventually determine the degree to which the use of parallel data ts vmble to determine sense distinctions, and, ff so, the ways in which th~s reformation might be used Given the lack of lalge parallel texts across multiple languages, the study is necessarily hmlted, however, close exammanon of a small sample of parallel data can, as a first step, provide the basis and dlrectmn for more extensive studies 1 Methodology I have conducted a small study using parallel, aligned versmns ot George Orwell''s Nineteen Etghtv-Fo,lr (Euavec and Ide, 1998)m five languages Enghsh, Slovene, Estonian, Romanlan, and Czech I The study therefole Involves languages from four language families The O~well parallel corpus also includes vers|ons o) Ntneteen-E~gho Four m Hungarian, Bulgarmn, Latwan, Llthuaman, Se~bmn, and Russmn (Germanic, Slavic, Fmno-Ugrec, and Romance), two languages from the same family (Czech and Slovene), as well as one non-Indo-European language (Estoman) Nmeteen Eighty-Four Is a text of about 100,000 words, translated directly from the original English m each of the other languages The parallel versions of the text are sentence-aligned to the English and tagged for part of speech Although Nineteen Eighty-Four is a work of fiction, Orwell''s prose IS not highly stylized and, as such, it provides a reasonable sample ot modern, ordinary language that ~s not tied to a given topic or sub-domain (such as newspapers, technical reports, etc ) Furthermore, the translations of the text seem to be relatively faithful to the original for instance, over 95% ot the sentence alignments in the full pmallel corpus of seven languages are one-to-one (Prlest-Dorman, et al, 1997) Nine ambiguous English words were considered hard, head, country, hne, promise, shght, seize, scrap, float The first four were chosen because they have been used in other dlsamb~guatlon studies, the latter five were chosen from among the words used m the Senseval dlsamblguatlon exercise (Kllgamff and Palmer, forthcoming) In all cases, the study was necessarily hmlted to words that occurred frequently enough in the Orwell text to warrant consideration F~ve hundred forty-two sentences conta|nmg an occurrence or occurrences (Including morphological variants) of each of the nine words were extracted from the Enghsh text, together w~th the parallel sentences m which they occur m the texts ot the four comparison languages (Czech, Estonian, Romantan, Slovene) As Walks and Stevenson (1998) have pointed out, pa~t-of-speech tagging accomplishes a good portion of the work ot semantic dlsamb~guatmn, therefore occmrences of wolds that appemed in the data in more than 54 one part of speech were grouped separately 2 The Enghsh occurrences were then grouped usmg the sense distinctions m WordNet, (version 1 6) [Miller et al, 1990, Fellbaum, 1998]) The sense categonzatmn was performed by the author and two student assistants, results from the three were compared and a final, mutually agreeable set of sense assignments was estabhshed For each of the four comparison languages, the corpus of sense-grouped parallel sentences were sent to a llngmst and natl,ve speaker of the comparison language The hngmsts were asked to provide the lexlcal item m each parallel sentence that corresponds to the ambiguous Enghsh word If inflected, they were asked to provide both the inflected form and the root form In addttmn, the lmgmsts were asked to indicate the type of translatmn, according to the dtstmctmns given m Table 1 For over 85% of the Enghsh word occurrences (corresponding to types 1 and 2 m Table 1), a specific lexlcal item or items could be identified as the translation equivalent for the corresponding Enghsh word For comparison purposes, each translanon equivalent was represented by ~ts lemma (or the lemma of the toot form in the case of derivatives) and associated w~th the WordNet sense to which it corresponds In order to determine the degree to which the assigned sense dlstlncttons correspond to translation eqmvalents, a coherence index ( Cl) was computed that measures how often each pmr of senses is translated usmg the same word as well as the consistency with which a g~ven se,ls,z ~s translated with the same word ~ Note that the z The adJective and adverb senses of hard are consadeied together because the distinction is not consistent across the translations used m the study Note that the CI ~s similar to semanuc entropy (Melamed, 1997) However, Melamed computes CIs do not determine whether or not a sense dtstmctton can be lextcahzed in the target language, but only the degree to whmh they are lexicahzed differently m the translated text However, tt can be assumed that the CIs provide a measure of the tendency to lex~cahze different WordNet senses differently, which can m turn be seen as an mdtcatmn of the degree to which the distraction ts vahd For each ambiguous word, the CI Is computed for each pair of senses, as follows S<q t> Cl(sqS, ) = ''=1 m rnrt where @ n ~s the number of comparison languages under consideration, nl~q and m,, are the nt~mber of

languages If sense and sense ) are consistently translated w~th the same wo~d in each comparison language, then Cl(s, s~) = 1, if they are translated with a different word m every occurrence, Cl(s, ~) = 0 In general, the CI for pans of different senses provides an index of thmr relatedness, t e, the greater the value of Cl(s, sj), the more frequently occurrences of-sense t and sense j are

define and structure sense d~stmct~ons The cluster graphs above provide mformat~on about relations among WordNet senses that could be used, for example, to determine the granularity of sense differences, whtch m turn could be used in tasks such as machine translatton, mtormaUon retrieval, etc For example, it is hkely that as sense dtstmcttons become finer, the degree of error ~s less severe Resmk and Yarowsky (1997) suggest that confusing freer-grained sense dtstmctlons should be penahzed less severely than confusing grosser d~stmct~ons when evaluatmg the performance of sense dtsambtguatt0n systems The clusters also provide insight into the lexlcallzatlon of sense dtstmcttons related by various semantic relations (metonymy, meronymy, etc ) across languages, for instance, the ''part of the body'' and ''intellect'' senses of head are lex~cahzed with the same ~tem a s~gnlficant portion of the t~me across all languages, reformation that could be used m machine translatton In addtt~on, cluster data such as that presented here could be used m lexicography, to determine a mole detaded hierarchy of relations among senses in dtct~onary entries It is less clear how cross-hngual reformation can be used to determine sense d~st~nctlons independent of a pre-deflned set, such as the WordNet senses used here In an effort to explore how thts mlght be done, I have used the small sample from thts study to create word groupmgs from ''back translations'' (l e, additional translations m the original language ot the translations m the target language) and developed a metric that uses th~s mformatton to determine relatedness between occurrences, whtch ~s m turn used to cluster occurrences into sense groups I have also compared sets of back translations for words representing the various WordNet senses, which provtde word groups s~mdar to WordNet synsets Interestingly, there ts virtually no overlap between the WordNet synsets and word groups generated from back translations The results show, however, that sense dlstmctlons useful for natural language processing tasks such as machme translanon could potentsally be determined, ot at least influenced, by constdeHng this mformatton The automatically generated synsets themselves may also be useful m the same apphcatlons; where WordNet synsets (and ontologtes) have been used tn the past More work needs to be done on the topic of cross-hngual sense determination, utthzmg substantially larger parallel corpora that include a variety ot language types as well as texts fiom several genres This small study explores a possible methodology to apply when such resources become avatlable Acknowledgements The author would hke to gratefully acknowledge the contrtbut~on of those who provided the

'1 Introduction Robust statistical syntactic parsers , made possible by new statistical techniques <OTH> and by the availability of large , hand-annotated training corpora such as WSJ <OTH> and Switchboard <OTH> , have had a major impact on the field of natural language processing '

'and CAUS ate slgmficantly different for unaccusattve and object-dtop verbs, indicating that we need additional featules that have different values across these two classes In Section 2 1, we noted

of ammacy of subject, that is intended to distinguish nouns that receive an Agent role flora those that receive a Theme role Recall that objectdrop verbs assign Agent to their subject in both the transitive and intransitive alternations, while unaccusattves assign Agent to their subject only in the transitive, and Theme m the intransitive We expect then that object-drop verbs will occur more

external to the corpus, we instead count pronouns (other than ~t) m subject positron The assumptmn ~s that the words I, we, you, she, he, and they most often refer to ammate ent~tms The values for the

to all subjects We again apply t-tests to our new data to determine whether the sets of PRo values d~ffer across the verb classes Interestingly, we find that the Prto values for unaccusat~ve verbs

'2 The IBM Model 4 For the work described in this paper we used a modified version of the statistical machine translation tool developed in the context of the 1999 Johns HopkinsSummer Workshop <OTH> , which implements IBM translation model 4 <CIT> '
'For this we used two resources : CELEX a linguistically annotated dictionary of English , Dutch and German <OTH> , and the Dutch snowball stemmer implementing a suf x stripping algorithm based on the Porter stemmer '
'32 Word Order Differences Another problem that has been noticed as early as 1993 with the first research on word alignment <CIT> concerns the differences in word order between source and target language '
'<OTH> , <CIT> and Lee <OTH> , Wilson et al '
'As suggested in <CIT> , we use the averaged perceptron when applying the model to held-out or test data '
'Opinion forecasting differs from that of opinion analysis , such as extracting opinions , evaluating sentiment , and extracting predictions <CIT> '
', Models 2 and 3 of <CIT> '
'The approach is in the spirit of Smadja <OTH> on retrieving collocations from text corpora , but is more integrated with parsing '
'<CIT> indicated that their results can not directly compare to the results of Shi and Wang <OTH> due to different experimental settings '
'<OTH> found that direct annotation takes twice as long as automatic tagging plus correction , for partof-speech annotation -RRB- ; and the output quality reflects the difficulty of the task -LRB- inter-annotator disagreement is on the order of 10 % , as contrasted with the approximately 3 % error rate reported for part-of-speech annotation by <CIT> et al -RRB- '
'1 Introduction In the community of sentiment analysis <CIT> , transferring a sentiment classifier from one source domain to another target domain is still far from a trivial work , because sentiment expression often behaves with strong domain-specific nature '
'We view L2P as a tagging task that can be performed with a discriminative learning method , such as the Perceptron HMM <CIT> '
'Using a variant of the voted perceptron <CIT> , we discriminatively trained our parser in an on-line fashion '
'Perhaps the most widely accepted convention is that of ignoring punctuation for the purposes of assigning constituent span, under the perspective that, fun788 Phrase Evaluation Scenario System Type (a) (b) (c) Modified All 98.37 99.72 99.72 Truth VP 92.14 98.70 98.70 Li and Roth All 94.64 (2001) VP 95.28 Collins (1997) All 92.16 93.42 94.28 VP 88.15 94.31 94.42 Charniak All 93.88 95.15 95.32 (2000) VP 88.92 95.11 95.19 Table 1: F-measure shallow bracketing accuracy under three different evaluation scenarios: (a) baseline, used in Li and Roth (2001), with original chunklink script converting treebank trees and context-free parser output; (b) same as (a), except that empty subject NPs are inserted into every unary SVP production; and (c) same as (b), except that punctuation is ignored for setting constituent span.'

'The interpolation weights a65 -LRB- Equation 2 -RRB- are trained using discriminative training <CIT> using ROUGEa129 as the objective function , on the development set '
'53 Evaluation Metric This paper focuses on the BLEU metric as presented in <CIT> '
'where mk is one mention in entity e , and the basic model building block PL -LRB- L = 1je , mk , m -RRB- is an exponential or maximum entropy model <CIT> '
'Word alignment models were first introduced in statistical machine translation <CIT> '
'Applying the projection WTx -LRB- where x is a training instance -RRB- would give us m new features , however , for both computational and statistical reasons <CIT> a low-dimensional approximation of the original feature space is computed by applying Singular Value Decomposition -LRB- SVD -RRB- on W -LRB- step 4 -RRB- '
'One of the main directions is sentiment classification , which classifies the whole opinion document -LRB- eg , a product review -RRB- as positive or negative <CIT> '
'<CIT> all use multiple context words as discriminating features '
'2Note that sentence extraction does not solve the problem of selecting and ordering summary sentences to form a coherent There are several approaches to modeling document content : simple word frequency-based methods <OTH> , graph-based approaches <OTH> , as well as more linguistically motivated techniques <OTH> '
'By introducing the hidden word alignment variable a, the following approximate optimization criterion can be applied for that purpose: e = argmaxe Pr(e | f) = argmaxe summationdisplay a Pr(e,a | f)  argmaxe,a Pr(e,a | f) Exploiting the maximum entropy (Berger et al. , 1996) framework, the conditional distribution Pr(e,a | f) can be determined through suitable real valued functions (called features) hr(e,f,a),r = 1R, and takes the parametric form: p(e,a | f)  exp Rsummationdisplay r=1 rhr(e,f,a)} The ITC-irst system (Chen et al. , 2005) is based on a log-linear model which extends the original IBM Model 4 (Brown et al. , 1993) to phrases (Koehn et al. , 2003; Federico and Bertoldi, 2005).'
'Formally , by distributional similarity -LRB- or co-occurrence similarity -RRB- of two words w 1 and w 2 , we mean that they tend to occur in similar contexts , for some definition of context ; or that the set of words that w 1 tends to co-occur with is similar to the set that w 2 tends to co-occur with ; or that if w 1 is substituted for w 2 in a context , its plausibility <CIT> is unchanged '
'(Note that conditioning on the rules parent is needed to disallow the structure [NP [NP PP] PP]; see Johnson [1997] for further discussion.)'
'Recent work has explored two-stage decoding , which explicitly decouples decoding into a source parsing stage and a target language model integration stage <CIT> '
'Machine translation has code-like characteristics , and indeed , the initial models of <CIT> took a word-substitution\/transposition approach , trained on a parallel text '
'Training Procedure Our algorithm is a modification of the perceptron ranking algorithm <OTH> , which allows for joint learning across several ranking problems <CIT> '
'We are currently investigating more challenging problems like multiple category classification using the Reuters-21578 data set <OTH> and subjective sentiment classification <CIT> '
'We used <CIT> statistical parser trained on examples from the Penn Treebank to generate parses of the same format for the sentences in our data '
'They constructed word clusters by using HMMs or Browns clustering algorithm <CIT> , which utilize only information from neighboring words '
'An additional translation set called the Maximum BLEU set is employed by the SMT system to train the weights associated with the components of its log-linear model <CIT> '
'In our SRL system , we select maximum entropy <CIT> as a classi er to implement the semantic role labeling system '

'2 Background Several graph-based learning techniques have recently been developed and applied to NLP problems : minimum cuts <CIT> , random walks <OTH> , graph matching <OTH> , and label propagation <OTH> '

'Unfortunately , as shown in <CIT> , with the represetation of sentences that we use , linear classifiers can not discriminate real sentences from sentences sampled from a trigram , which is the model we use as a baseline , so here we resort to a non-linear large-margin classifier -LRB- see section 3 for details -RRB- '

'Therefore , to make the phrase-based SMT system robust against data sparseness for the ranking task , we also make use of the IBM Model 4 <CIT> in both directions '
'Then the alignments are symmetrized using a refined heuristic as described in <CIT> '
'To measure the coherence of sentences , we use a statistical parser Toolkit <CIT> to assign each sentence a parsers score that is the related log probability of parsing '

The first production rule, intuitively, says that the subtree [[]B[]C]A in the source language translates into 62 a subtree [[]B[]C]A, whereas the second production rule inverts the order in the target language, i.e. [[]C[]B]A.

'INTRODUCTION Word associations have been studied for some time in the fields of psycholinguistics -LRB- by testing human subjects on words -RRB- , linguistics -LRB- where meaning is often based on how words co-occur with each other -RRB- , and more recently , by researchers in natural language processing <CIT> using statistical measures to identify sets of associated words for use in various natural language processing tasks '
'In a next step , chunk information was added by a rule-based language-independent chunker <CIT> that contains distituency rules , which implies that chunk boundaries are added between two PoS codes that can not occur in the same constituent '
'A few exceptions are the hierarchical -LRB- possibly syntaxbased -RRB- transduction models <CIT> and the string transduction models <OTH> '
'Yet , the very nature of these alignments , as defined in the IBM modeling approach <CIT> , lead to descriptions of the correspondences between sourcelanguage -LRB- SL -RRB- and target-language -LRB- TL -RRB- words of a translation that are often unsatisfactory , at least from a human perspective '
'Previous attempts have used , for instance , the similarities between case frames <OTH> , anchor words <CIT> , and a web-based method <OTH> '
'In order to calculate a global score or probability for a transition sequence , two systems used a Markov chain approach <OTH> '
'We measured stability -LRB- the degree to which the same annotator will produce an annotation after 6 weeks -RRB- and reproducibility -LRB- the degree to which two unrelated annotators will produce the same annotation -RRB- , using the Kappa coefficient K <CIT> , which controls agreement P -LRB- A -RRB- for chance agreement P -LRB- E -RRB- : K = PA -RRB- - P -LRB- E -RRB- 1-P -LRB- Z -RRB- Kappa is 0 for if agreement is only as would be expected by chance annotation following the same distribution as the observed distribution , and 1 for perfect agreement '
'2.2.1 The evaluator The evaluator is a function p(t[t'', s) which assigns to each target-text unit t an estimate of its probability given a source text s and the tokens t'' which precede t in the current translation of s. Our approach to modeling this distribution is based to a large extent on that of the IBM group (Brown et al. , 1993), but it diflhrs in one significant aspect: whereas the IBM model involves a ''noisy channel'' decomposition, we use a linear combination of separate predictions from a language model p(t[t'') and a translation model p(t[s).'
'First , a non-anaphoric NP classifier identifies definite noun phrases that are existential , using both syntactic rules and our learned existential NP recognizer <CIT> , and removes them from the resolution process '

'Discriminative, context-specific training seems to yield a better set of similar predicates, e.g. the highest-ranked contexts for DSPcooc on the verb join,3 lead 1.42, rejoin 1.39, form 1.34, belong to 1.31, found 1.31, quit 1.29, guide 1.19, induct 1.19, launch (subj) 1.18, work at 1.14 give a better SIMS(join) for Equation (1) than the top similarities returned by (Lin, 1998a): participate 0.164, lead 0.150, return to 0.148, say 0.143, rejoin 0.142, sign 0.142, meet 0.142, include 0.141, leave 0.140, work 0.137 Other features are also weighted intuitively.'

'3 Statistical Word Alignment According to the IBM models <CIT> , the statistical word alignment model can be generally represented as in equation -LRB- 1 -RRB- '
'1 Introduction In a classical statistical machine translation , a foreign language sentence f J1 = f1 , f2 , fJ is translated into another language , ie English , eI1 = e1 , e2 , , eI by seeking a maximum likely solution of : eI1 = argmax eI1 Pr -LRB- eI1 f J1 -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- = argmax eI1 Pr -LRB- f J1 eI1 -RRB- Pr -LRB- eI1 -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- The source channel approach in Equation 2 independently decomposes translation knowledge into a translation model and a language model , respectively <CIT> '
'This is an unsuitable measure for inferring reliability , and it was the use of this measure that prompted <CIT> to recommend chance-corrected measures '
'Once the set of features functions are selected , algorithm such as improved iterative scaling <CIT> or sequential conditional generalized iterative scaling <OTH> can be used to find the optimal parameter values of fkg and fig '
'In the similaritybased approaches <CIT> , rather than a class , each word is modelled by its own set of similar words derived from statistical data collected from corpora '
'Estimation of the parameters has been described elsewhere <CIT> '
'According to one account <OTH> the majority of errors arise because of the statistical filtering process , which is reported to be particularly unreliable for low frequency SCFs <OTH> '
'Sentiment summarization has been well studied in the past decade <CIT> '
'This is also true for reranking and discriminative training , where the k-best list of candidates serves as an approximation of the full set <CIT> '
'The tree-based reranker includes the features described in <CIT> as well as features based on non-projective edge attributes explored in <OTH> '
'The chunking classification was made by <CIT> based on the parsing information in the WSJ corpus '
'A similar approach was taken in <OTH> where an unknown word was guessed given the probabilities for an unknown word to be of a particular POS , its capitalization feature and its ending '
'In retrospect , however , there are perhaps even greater similarities to that of <CIT> '
'Decoding weights are optimized using Ochs algorithm <CIT> to set weights for the four components of the loglinear model : language model , phrase translation model , distortion model , and word-length feature '
'We use the GIZA + + implementation of IBM Model 4 <CIT> coupled with the phrase extraction heuristics of Koehn et al '
'While simple statistical alignment models like IBM-1 <CIT> and the symmetric alignment approach by Hiemstra -LRB- 1996 -RRB- treat sentences as unstructured bags of words , the more sophisticated IBM-models by Brown et al '
'Two block sets are derived for each of the training sets using a phrase-pair selection algorithm similar to <CIT> '
'The different approaches <OTH> vary largely according to the methods used and the number of SCFS being extracted '
'<OTH> and <CIT> -LRB- and see below for discussions -RRB- , so in this paper we focus on the less studied , but equally important problem of annotationstyle adaptation '
'Syntactic context information is used <CIT> to compute term similarities , based on which similar words to a particular word can directly be returned '
'To obtain their corresponding weights , we adapted the minimum-error-rate training algorithm <CIT> to train the outside-layer model '
'For a full description of the algorithm , see <CIT> '
'Following <CIT> , we adopt the view that the syntactic structure of sentences paraphrasing some sentence s should be inspired by the structure of s Because dependency syntax is still only a crude approximation to semantic structure , we augment the model with a lexical semantics component , based on WordNet <OTH> , that models how words are probabilistically altered in generating a paraphrase '
'We consider the outputs of the top 3 allwords WSD systems that participated in Senseval-3 : Gambl <OTH> , SenseLearner <OTH> , and KOC University <OTH> '
'33 System evaluation Since both the system translations and the reference translations are available for the tuning 43 set , we first compare each output to the reference translation using BLEU <OTH> and METEOR <CIT> and a combined scoring scheme provided by the ULC toolkit <OTH> '
'Specifically , we will consider a system which was developed for the ACE -LRB- Automatic Content Extraction -RRB- task 3 and includes the following stages : name structure parsing , coreference , semantic relation extraction and event extraction <CIT> '
'The preprocessed training data was filtered for length and aligned using the GIZA + + implementation of IBM Model 4 <CIT> in both directions and symmetrized using the grow-diag-final-and heuristic '
'This gives the translation model more information about the structure of the source language , and further constrains the reorderings to match not just a possible bracketing as in <CIT> , but the specific bracketing of the parse tree provided '
'To support a more rigorous analysis , however , wc have followed <CIT> of using the K coettMcnt <OTH> as a measure of coder agreement '

'An alternative representation for baseNPs has been put forward by <CIT> '
'We compare those algorithms to generalized iterative scaling -LRB- GIS -RRB- <OTH> , non-preconditioned CG , and voted perceptron training <CIT> '
'The other main difference is the apparently nonlocal nature of the problem , which motivates our choice of a Maximum Entropy -LRB- ME -RRB- model for the tagging task <CIT> '
'1 Introduction Statistical machine translation <CIT> has seen many improvements in recent years , most notably the transition from wordto phrase-based models <OTH> '
'<CIT> To reduce the inference time , following <OTH> , we collapsed the 45 different POS labels contained in the original data '

'1 Introduction Word alignment is a critical component in training statistical machine translation systems and has received a significant amount of research , for example , <OTH> , including work leveraging syntactic parse trees , eg , <CIT> '
'Recently <CIT> have sought to acquire automatically some semantic patterns that can be used as contextual information to improve reference resolution , using techniques adapted from information extraction '
'A standard solution is to use a weighted linear mixture of N-gram models , 1 n N , <CIT> '
'Recently , confusion-network-based system combination algorithms have been developed to combine outputs of multiple machine translation -LRB- MT -RRB- systems to form a consensus output <CIT> '
'There are several basic methods for evaluating associations between words : based on frequency counts <OTH> , information theoretic <OTH> and statistical significance <CIT> '
'A possible solution to this problem is to directly estimate p -LRB- A w -RRB- by applying a maximum entropy model <CIT> '
'We used the preprocessed data to train the phrase-based translation model by using GIZA + + <OTH> and the Pharaoh tool kit <CIT> '
'We estimate loss gradients -LRB- Equation 13 -RRB- using a sample of the inference set , which gives a 100-fold increase in training speed <CIT> '
'To quickly -LRB- and approximately -RRB- evaluate this phenomenon , we trained the statistical IBM wordalignment model 4 <OTH> ,1 using the GIZA + + software <CIT> for the following language pairs : ChineseEnglish , Italian English , and DutchEnglish , using the IWSLT-2006 corpus <OTH> for the first two language pairs , and the Europarl corpus <OTH> for the last one '
'Perhaps the most related is 86 learning as search optimization -LRB- LASO -RRB- <CIT> '
'Experiments We have conducted a series of lexical acquisition experiments with the above algorithm on largescale English corpora , eg , the Brown corpus <OTH> and the PTB WSJ corpus <CIT> '
'To avoid this problem , generative models for NLP tasks have often been manually designed to achieve an appropriate representation of the joint distribution , such as in the parsing models of <CIT> '
'Although grammatical function and empty nodes annotation expressing long-distance dependencies are provided in Treebanks such as the Penn Treebank <CIT> , most statistical Treebank trained parsers fully or largely ignore them 1 , which entails two problems : first , the training can not profit from valuable annotation data '
'In the tagging domain , <CIT> compared log-linear and perceptron training for HMM-style tagging based on dynamic programming '
'413 Letter Lexical Transliteration Similar to IBM Model-1 <CIT> , we use a bag-of-letter generative model within a block to approximate the lexical transliteration equivalence : P -LRB- fj + lj ei + ki -RRB- = j + lproductdisplay jprime = j i + ksummationdisplay iprime = i P -LRB- fjprime eiprime -RRB- P -LRB- eiprime ei + ki -RRB- , -LRB- 10 -RRB- where P -LRB- eiprime ei + ki -RRB- similarequal 1 \/ -LRB- k +1 -RRB- is approximated by a bagof-word unigram '

'Intuitively, if we allow any Source words to be aligned to any Target words, the best alignment that we can come up with is the one in Figure 1.c. Sentence pair (S2, T2) offers strong evidence that b c in language S means the same thing as x in language T. On the basis of this evidence, we expect the system to also learn from sentence pair (S1, T1) that a in language S means the same thing as y in language T. Unfortunately, if one works with translation models that do not allow Target words to be aligned to more than one Source word  as it is the case in the IBM models (Brown et al. , 1993)  it is impossible to learn that the phrase b c in language S means the same thing as word x in language T. The IBM Model 4 (Brown et al. , 1993), for example, converges to the word alignments shown in Figure 1.b and learns the translation probabilities shown in Figure 1.a.2 Since in the IBM model one cannot link a Target word to more than a Source word, the training procedure 2To train the IBM-4 model, we used Giza (Al-Onaizan et al. , 1999).'

'The MT systems of <CIT> learn to generate text in the target language straight from the source language , without the aid of an explicit semantic representation '
'Many of the current approaches of domain modeling collapse together different instances and make the decision on what information is important for a domain based on this generalized corpus <CIT> '
'The benefits of using grammatical information for automatic WSD were first explored by <CIT> and Resnik -LRB- 1996 -RRB- in unsupervised approaches to disambiguating single words in context '

'A variety of algorithms -LRB- eg , bootstrapping <CIT> , co-training <OTH> , alternating structure optimization <OTH> , etc -RRB- '
'Since Chinese text is not orthographically separated into words , the standard methodology is to first preproce ~ input texts through a segmentation module <OTH> '
'Several authors have used mutual information and similar statistics as an objective function for word clustering <CIT> , for automatic determination of phonemic baseforms <OTH> , and for language modeling for speech recognition <OTH> '
'Uses Maximum Entropy <CIT> classification , trained on JNLPBA <OTH> -LRB- NER -RRB- '
'Word-aligned corpora have been found to be an excellent source for translation-related knowledge , not only for phrase-based models <CIT> , but also for syntax-based models -LRB- eg , <OTH> -RRB- '
'One judge annotated allarticles in four datasets of the Wall Street Journal Treebank corpus <CIT> -LRB- W9-4 , W9-10 , W9-22 , and W933 , each approximately 160K words -RRB- as well as thecorpusofWall Street Journal articles used in <OTH> -LRB- called WSJ-SE below -RRB- '
'We set all feature weights by optimizing Bleu <CIT> directly using minimum error rate training -LRB- MERT -RRB- <OTH> on the tuning part of the development set <OTH> '
'We use the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus as the large corpus and individual sections of the Brown corpus as the target corpora <CIT> '
'The most common answer is component testing , where the component is compared against a standard of goodness , usually the Penn Treebank for English <CIT> , allowing a numerical score of precision and recall <OTH> '
'In the present work , the approach taken by <CIT> is used to derive such values for selected phrases in the text '
'Mutual infornaation involves a problem in that it is overestimated for low-frequency terms -LRB- I -RRB- unning 1993 -RRB- '
'<OTH> uses the mutual information clustering algorithm described in <CIT> '
'The second attempts to instill knowledge of collocations in the data ; we use the technique described by <CIT> to compute multi-word expressions and then mark words that are commonly used as such with a feature that expresses this fact '
'Several sentiment information retrieval models were proposed in the framework of probabilistic language models by <CIT> '
'Word alignments were produced by GIZA + + <CIT> with a standard training regimen of five iterations of Model 1 , five iterations of the HMM Model , and five iterations of Model 4 , in both directions '
'32 Details To learn alignments , translation probabilities , etc in the first method we used work that has been done in statistical machine translation <CIT> , where the translation process is considered to be equivalent to a corruption of the source language text to the target language text due to a noisy channel '
'We apply the log likelihood principle <CIT> to compute this score '
'For automatic evaluation , we employed BLEU <CIT> by following <OTH> '

'1 Introduction The Inversion Transduction Grammar or ITG formalism , which historically was developed in the context of translation and alignment , hypothesizes strong expressiveness restrictions that constrain paraphrases to vary word order only in certain allowable nested permutations of arguments <CIT> '
'Table 6 contrasts our results with those from <CIT> '
'Because of this , it is generally accepted that some kind of postprocessing should be performed to improve the final result , by shortening , fusing , or otherwise revising the material <CIT> '
'The other approach selected was <CIT> '
'The tagger from <CIT> first annotates sentences of raw text with a sequence of partof-speech tags '
'<CIT> used both supervised and unsupervised WSD for correct phonetizitation of words in speech synthesis '
'The former is a task of identifying positive and negative sentiments from a text which can be a passage , a sentence , a phrase and even a word <CIT> '
'2 Statistical Word Alignment According to the IBM models <OTH> , the statistical word alignment model can be generally represented as in Equation -LRB- 1 -RRB- '
'Further work will look at how to integrate probabilities such as p -LRB- clv , r -RRB- into a model of dependency structure , similar to that of <CIT> and Collins -LRB- 1997 -RRB- , which can be used -LRB- ` or parse selection '
'If POS denotes the POS of the English word , we can define the word-to-word distance measure -LRB- Equation 4 -RRB- as POS POS -LRB- 15 -RRB- Ratnaparkhis POS tagger <CIT> was used to obtain POS tags for each word in the English sentence '
'43 Baseline We use a standard log-linear phrase-based statistical machine translation system as a baseline : GIZA + + implementation of IBM word alignment model 4 <OTH> ,8 the refinement and phrase-extraction heuristics described in <CIT> , minimum-error-rate training 7More specifically , we choose the first English reference from the 7 references and the Chinese sentence to construct new sentence pairs '
'Surprisingly , though , rather little work has been devoted to learning local syntactic patterns , mostly noun phrases <CIT> '
'1 Introduction Finite-state parsing -LRB- also called chunking or shallow parsing -RRB- has typically been motivated as a fast firstpass for or approximation to more expensive context-free parsing <CIT> '
'This approach gave an improvement of 27 in BLEU <CIT> score on the IWSLT05 Japanese to English evaluation corpus -LRB- improving the score from 524 to 551 -RRB- '
'For instance , the Penn Treebank policy <CIT> is to annotate the lowest node that is unfinished with an - UNF tag as in Figure 4 -LRB- a -RRB- '
'This definition is similar to that of minimal translation units as described in <CIT> , although they allow null words on either side '
'122 SPECIFIC SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTIC ASSUMPTIONS The basic scheme , or some not too distant relative , is the one used in many large-scale implemented systems ; as examples , we can quote TEAM <OTH> , PUNDIT <OTH> , TACITUS <CIT> , MODL <OTH> , CLE <OTH> , and SNACK-85 <OTH> '
'Of particular relevance is other work on parsing the Penn WSJ Treebank <CIT> '
'In practice , we used MMR in our experiments , since the original MEAD considers also sentence positions 3 , which can always been added later as in <CIT> '
'The loglinear model weights are learned using Chiangs implementation of the maximum BLEU training algorithm <CIT> , both for the baseline , and the WSD-augmented system '
'On the other hand , structural annotation such as that used in syntactic treebanks <CIT> assigns a syntactic category to a contiguous sequence of corpus positions '
'Evaluations are typically carried out on newspaper texts , ie on section 23 of the Penn Treebank -LRB- PTB -RRB- <CIT> '
'We use the finite-state parses of FaSTU $ <OTH> for recognizing these entities , but the method extends to any basic phrasal parser 4 '
'The last line shows the results of <CIT> -LRB- recognizing NP ''s -RRB- with the same train\/test data '
'Prior to running the parsers , we trained the POS tagger described in <CIT> '
'9 The definition of BLEU used in this training was the original IBM definition <CIT> , which defines the effective reference length as the reference length that is closest to the test sentence length '

'More rare words rather than common words are found even in standard dictionaries <CIT> '
'Several researchers also studied feature\/topicbased sentiment analysis <CIT> '
'The noun phrase chunking -LRB- NP chunking -RRB- module uses the basic NP chunker software from 483 <CIT> to recognize the noun phrases in the question '
'221 BLEU Evaluation The BLEU score <CIT> was defined to measure overlap between a hypothesized translation and a set of human references '
'We tune all feature weights automatically <CIT> to maximize the BLEU <OTH> score on the dev set '
'Other linear time algorithms for rank reduction are found in the literature <CIT> , but they are restricted to the case of synchronous context-free grammars , a strict subclass of the LCFRS with f = 2 '
'In the above equation , P -LRB- ti -RRB- and P -LRB- wi ; t -RRB- are estimated by the maximum-likelihood method , and the probability of a POC tag ti , given a character wi -LRB- P -LRB- tijwi ; ti 2 TPOC -RRB- -RRB- is estimated using ME models <CIT> '
'Hyperparameter is automatically selected from 2Although <CIT> that for their dataset similar to ours was 083 , this value can not be directly compared with our value because their dataset includes both individual words and pairs of words '

'<CIT> also used windows of size 2 , which corresponds to word bigrams '
'Ralph Weischedel et al 1993 '
'Unlexicalized methods refine the grammar in a more conservative fashion , splitting each non-terminal or pre-terminal symbol into a much smaller number of subsymbols <CIT> '
'<CIT> describe the voted perceptron applied to the named-entity data in this paper , but using kernel-based features rather than the explicit features described in this paper '
'The algorithm is slightly different from other online training algorithms <OTH> in that we keep and update oracle translations , which is a set of good translations reachable by a decoder according to a metric , ie BLEU <CIT> '
'For instance , the resulting word graph can be used in the prediction engine of a CAT system <CIT> '

'The basic model uses the following features , analogous to Pharaohs default feature set : P -LRB- -RRB- and P -LRB- -RRB- the lexical weights Pw -LRB- -RRB- and Pw -LRB- -RRB- <CIT> ; 1 a phrase penalty exp -LRB- 1 -RRB- ; a word penalty exp -LRB- l -RRB- , where l is the number of terminals in '
'Other researchers <OTH> , <CIT> use clustering techniques coupled with syntactic dependency features to identify IS-A relations in large text collections '
'INTRODUCTION Class-based language models <CIT> have been proposed for dealing with two problems confronted by the well-known word n-gram language models -LRB- 1 -RRB- data sparseness : the amount of training data is insufficient for estimating the huge number of parameters ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- domain robustness : the model is not adaptable to new application domains '
'The construction is defined in Fillmore ''s <OTH> Construction Grammar as '' a pairing of a syntactic pattern with a meaning structure '' ; they are similar to signs in HPSG <OTH> and pattern-concept pairs <OTH> '
'7Following <CIT> , we measure agreement in Kappa , which follows the formula K = P -LRB- A -RRB- P -LRB- E -RRB- 1P -LRB- E -RRB- where P -LRB- A -RRB- is observed , and P -LRB- E -RRB- expected agreement '
'In <CIT> , automatically extracted collocations are judged by a lexicographer '
'The mutual information of a pair of words is defined in terms of their co-occurrence frequency and respective occurrence frequencies <CIT> '
'We carefully implemented the original Grammar Association system described in (Vidal et al. , 1993), tuned empirically a couple of smoothing parameters, trained the models and, finally, obtained an a119a21a120 a100 a104a122a121 of correct translations.9 Then, we studied the impact of: (1) sorting, as proposed in Section 3, the set of sentences presented to ECGI; (2) making language models deterministic and minimum; (3) constraining the best translation search to those sentences whose lengths have been seen, in the training set, related to the length of the input sentence.'
'In order to improve translation quality , this tuning can be effectively performed by minimizing translation error over a development corpus for which manually translated references are available <CIT> '
'Recently , there have been several discriminative approaches at training large parameter sets including <CIT> and <OTH> '
'5 Datasets and Evaluation We train our models with verb instances extracted from three parsed corpora : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank -LRB- PTB -RRB- , which was parsed by human annotators <CIT> , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the Brown Laboratory for Linguistic Information Processing corpus of Wall Street Journal text -LRB- BLLIP -RRB- , which was parsed automatically by the Charniak parser <OTH> , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the Gigaword corpus of raw newswire text -LRB- GW -RRB- , which we parsed ourselves with the Stanford parser '
'The original formulation of statistical machine translation <CIT> was defined as a word-based operation '
'This operation can be used in applications like Minimum Error Rate Training <CIT> , or optimizing system combination as described by Hillard et al '
'For evaluation we use a state-of-the-art baseline system -LRB- Moses -RRB- <OTH> which works with a log-linear interpolation of feature functions optimized by MERT <CIT> '
'Others try to accommodate both syntactic and lexical differences between the candidate translation and the reference , like CDER <OTH> , which employs a version of edit distance for word substitution and reordering ; or METEOR <CIT> , which uses stemming and WordNet synonymy '
'Generative methods <CIT> treat word alignment as a hidden process and maximize the likelihood of bilingual training corpus using the expectation maximization -LRB- EM -RRB- algorithm '
'42 Experiments on SRL dataset We used two different corpora : PropBank -LRB- wwwcisupennedu\/ace -RRB- along with Penn Treebank 2 <CIT> and FrameNet '
'These constraints tie words in such a way that the space of alignments can not be enumerated as in IBM models 1 and 2 <OTH> '
'In the literature on the kappa statistic , most authors address only category data ; some can handle more general data , such as data in interval scales or ratio scales <CIT> '
'Movie and product reviews have been the main focus of many of the recent studies in this area <CIT> '

'Towards a Meaning-Full Comparison of Lexieal Resources Kenneth C Lltkowska CL Research 9208 Gue Road Damascus, MD 20872 ken@clres corn http//www tires tom Abstract The mapping from WordNet to Hector senses m Senseval provides a ''gold standard'' against wluch to judge our ability to compare lexlcal resources The ''gold standard'' is provided through a word overlap analysis (with and without a stop list) for flus mapping, achieving at most a 36 percent correct mapping (inflated by 9 percent from ''empty'' assignments) An alternaUve componenttal analysis of the defimtaons, using syntacUc, collocatmnal, and semantac component and relation identification (through the use ofdefimng patterns integrated seamlessly mto the parsing thclaonary), provides an almost 41 percent correct mapping, with an additaonal 4 percent by recogmzmg semantic components not used in the Senseval mapping Defimtion sets of the Senseval words from three pubhshed thclaonanes and Dorr''s lextcal knowledge base were added to WordNet and the Hector database to exanune the nature of the mapping process between defimtton sets of more and less sco[~e The tecbauques described here consUtute only an maaal implementation of the componenUal analysis approach and suggests that considerable further improvements can be aclueved Introduction The difficulty of companng lemcal resources, long a s~gnfficant challenge in computauonal hnguistlcs (Atlans, 1991), came to the fore in the recent Senseval competatton (IOlgarnff, 1998), when some systems that relied heavily on the WordNet (Miller, et al, 1990) sense inventory were faced with the necessity of using another sense inventory (Hecto0 A hasty solutaon to the problem was the '' development of a map between the two inventories, but some part~cipants expressed concerns that use of flus map may have degraded their performance to an unknown degree Although there were disclaimers about the WordNet-Hector map, it nonetheless stands as a usable gold standard for efforts to compare lexical resources Moreover, we have a usable baseline (a word overlap method suggested m (Lesk, 1986)) against which to compare whether we are able to make improvements m the mapping (since flus method has been shown to perform not as well as expected (Krovetz, 1992)) We first describe the lextcal resources used m the study (Hector, WordNet, other dicUonanes, and a lex~cal knowledge base), first characterizing them in terms ofpolysemy and the types of leracal mformaUon each contmns (syntacUc properties and features, semantac components and relaUons, and collocaUonal properties) We then present results of perfornung the word overlap analysis of the 18 verbs used m Senseval, analyzing the definitions m WordNet and Hector We then expand our analysis to include other dictionaries We describe our methods of analysis, particularly the methods of parsing defimtaons and identff)qng semantic relations (semrels) based on defimng patterns, essentially takang first steps m Implementing the program described by Atkms and focusmg on the use of''meamng'' full mformataon rather than statistical mformaUon We identify the results that have been achieved thus far and outline further steps that may add more ''meanmg'' to the analysis IAll analyses described m this paper were performed automatically using functlonahty incorporated m DIMAP

defimtlons were uploaded into DIMAP dicUonanes after use of a conversmn program Defimtlons for other 30 The Lexical Resources Tlus analysis focuses on the mmn verb senses used In Senseval (not ichoms and phrases), specifically the followmg AMAZE, BAND, BET, BOTHER, BURY, CALCULATE, CONSUME, DERIVE, FLOAT, HURDLE, INVADE, PROMISE, SACK, SANCTION, SCRAP, SEIZE, SHAKE, SLIGHT The Hector database used In Senseval consists of a tree of senses, each of which contains defimttons, syntactic properties, example usages, and ''clues'' (collocational information about the syntactic and semantic enwronment in wluch a word appears in the spectfic sense) The WordNet database contmns synonyms (synsets), perhaps a defimtton or example usages (gloss), some syntactic mformaUon (verb frames), hypernyms, hyponyms, and some other semrels (ENTAILS, CAUSES) To extend our analysis In order to look at other issues of lexacal resource comparison, we have included the defirauons or leracal information from the following additional sources  Webster''s 3 ra New International Dictionary (W3)  Oxford Advanced l.earners D~ctlonary (OALD)  American Hentage DlcUonary (AI-ID)  Dorr''s Lexacal Knowledge Base (Dorr) We used only the defimuons from W3, OALD, and AHD (which also contmn sample usages and some collocattonal information m the form of usage notes, not used at the present tame) Dorr''s database contains thematic grids wluch characterize the thematic roles of obligatory and optional semanuc components, frequently identifying accompanying preposmons (Olsen, et al, 1998) The following table

the lexicographer''s mappmg from WordNet 1 6 to Hector, using a s~mple word overlap analysis smular to (Lesk, 1986) The lextcographer mapped the 66 WordNet senses (each synset m which a test occurred) Into 102 Hector senses A total of 86 assignments were made, 9 WordNet senses were gwen no assignments, 40 recewed exactly one, and 17 senses received 2 or 3 asssgnments The WordNet senses contained 348 words (about half of wluch were common words appeanng on our stop list, which contained 165 words, mostly preposmons, pronouns, and conjunctions) The Hector senses selected m the word overlap analysis contained about 960 words (all Hector senses contained 1878 words) We performed a strict word overlap analysts (with and wsthout a stop hst) between tile definlUons in WordNet and the Hector senses, that is, we did not attempt to ldenttfy root forms of Inflected words We took each word m a WordNet sense and determined whether ~t appeared in a Hector sense, we selected a Hector sense based on the highest percentage of words over all Hector senses An 31 empty selection was made ff all the words in the WordNet sense did not appear in any Hector sense, only content words were considered when the stop hst was used For example, for bet, WordNet sense 2 (stake (money) on the outcome of an issue) mapped into Hector sense 4 ((of a person) to risk (a sum of money or property) m thts way) In this case, there was an overlap on two words (money, 039 in the Hector defimtlon (0 13 of its 15 words) without the stop list When the stop list was invoked, there was an overlap of only one word (money, 0 07 of the Hector defimtion) In this case, the lexicographer had made three assignments (Hector senses 2, 3, and 4), our scoring method treated flus as only 1 out of 3 correct (not using the relaxed method employed in Senseval of treating flus as completely correct) Without the stop hst, our selections matched the lexicographer''s in 28 of 86 cases (32 6%), using the stop list, we were successful in 31 of 86 cases (36 1%) The improvement arising when the stop list was used is deceptive, where 8 cases were due to empty assignments (so that only 23 cases, 26 7%, were due to matching content words) Overall, only 41 content words were involved in these 23 successes when the stop list was used, an average of I 8 content words To summanze the word overlap analysis (1) despite a ncher set of defimtions in Hector, 9 of 66 WordNet senses (13 6%) could not be assigned, (2) despite the greater detail in Hector senses compared to WordNet senses (2 8 times as many words), only 1 8 content words participated in the assignments, and (3) therefore, the defimng vocabulary between these two definition sets seems to be somewhat divergent Although it might appear as if the word overlap analysis does not perform well, this is not the case The analysis provides a broad overview of the defimuon companson process between two definmon sets and frames a deeper analysis of the differences Moreover, it appears that the accuracy of a ''gold standard'' mapping is not crucially important The quality of the mapping may help frame the subsequent analysis more precisely, but it seems sufficient that any reasonable mapping will suffice This will be discussed further after presenting the results of the componentlal analysis of the defimtlons 32 Meaning-Full Analysis of Definitions The deeper analysis of the mapping between two defimtion sets relies primarily on two major steps (1) parsing definitions and using defimng patterns to identify semrels present m the definitions and (2) relaxing values to these relations by allowing ''synonymic'' substitution (using WordNet) Thus, for example, ffwe identify hypernyms or instruments from parsing a defimtion, we would say that the defimtions are ''equal'' not just ffthe hypernym or instrument is the same word, but also Lf the hypernyms or instruments are members of the same synset This approach is based on the finding (Litkowski, 1978) that a dictionary induces a semantic network where nodes represent ''concepts'' that may be lexicahzed and verbalized in more than one way This finding implies, in general, the absence of true synonyms, and instead the kind of ''concept'' embodied in WordNet synsets (with several lexical items and phraseologles) A slmdar approach, parsing defimtlons and relaxing semrel values, was followed in (Dolan, 1994) for clnstenng related senses w~thin a single dictionary The ideal toward which this approach strives is a complete identification of the meamng components included in a defimtion The meaning components can include syntactic features and charactenstlcs (including subcategonzation patterns), semantm components (realized through identification of semrels), selectional restrictions, and coUocational specifications The first stage of the analysis parses the definitions (CL Research, 1999b, Litkowski, to appear) and uses the parse results to extract (via defining patterns) semrels Since definitions have many idiosyncrasies (that do not follow ordinary text), an important first step in this stage is preprocessmg the definition text to put it into a sentence frame that facilitates the extraction of semrels 2 2Note that the stop hst is not applicable to the definition parsing The parser is a full-scale sentence parser, where prepositmns and other words on the stop list are necessary for successful parsing Moreover, inclusion of the prepositions is cmcml to the method, since they are the bearers of much semrel information The extractmn of semrels examines the parse results, a e, a tree whose mtermedaate nodes represent non-ternunals and whose leaves represent the lextcal atems that compnse the defimuons, where any node may also include annotations such as characterizations of number and tense For all noun or verb defimttons, flus includes Identification of the head noun (with recogmtton of''empty'' heads) or verb, for verbs, we signal whether the defimtaon contmned any selecttonal restnctmus (that as, pamcular parenthesazed expressaons) for the subject and object We then exanune preposattonal phrases In the defimUon and deterrmne whether we have a ''defining pattern'' for the preposaUon whach we can use as mdacaUve of a partacular semrel We also identify adverbs m the parse tree and look these up in WordNet to adentffy an adjecuve synset from wluch they are derived (if one is gwen) The defimng pattems are actually part of the dictionary used by the parser That is, we do not have to develop specafic routines to look for specLfic patterns A defimng pattern ~s a regular expressaon that arlaculates a syntactac pattern to be matched Thus, to recograze a ''manner'' semrel, we have the foUowmg entry for ''m'' m(dpat((~ rep0 l(det(0)) adj manner(0) st(manner)))) This allows us to recognize ''m'' as possibly gwmg rise to a ''manner'' component, where we recogmze ''m'' (the tdde, which allows us to specify partacular elements before the ''m'' as well), vath a noun phrase that consasts of 0 or 1 determiner, an adjectwe, and the lateral ''manner'' The ''0  after the detenmner and the hteral mdacate that these words are not copied into the value for a ''manner'' role, so that the value to the ''manner'' semrel becomes only the adjectwe that as recogmzed The second stage of the analysis uses the populated lexacal database to compare senses and make the selectaons This process follows the general methodology used m Senseval (Lltkowska, to appear) Specifically, m the defimtaon comparison, we first exanune exclusaon cntena to rule out specific mappings These criteria include syntacUc properUes (e g, a verb sense that Is only transluve cannot map into one that Is only mtransRave) and collocataonal propertaes (e g, a sense that is used with a parUcle cannot map into one that uses a different particle) At the present tune, these are used only rmmmally 33 We next score each viable sense based on rots semrels We increment the score ff the senses have a common hypernym or If a sense''s hypernyms belong  to the same synset as the other sense''s hypernyms If a parUcular sense con~ns a large number of synonyms (that as, no differentiae on the hypernym) and they overlap consaderably m the synsets they evoke, the score can be increased substanUally Currently, we add 5 points for each match 3 We increment the score based on common semrels In tins amtml tmplementaUon, we have defimng patterns (usually qmte nummal) for recogmzmg Instrument, means, location, purpose, source, manner, has-constituents, has-members, is-part-of, locale, and goal 4 We Increment the score by 2 points when we have a common semrel and then by another 5 points when the value Is ~dentacal or m the same synset After all possable increments to the scores have been made, we then select the sense(s) w~th the lughest score Finally, we compare our selecuon with that of the gold standard to assess our mapping over all senses Another way an wluch our methodology follows the Senseval process as that at proceeds incrementally Thus, ~t ms not necessary to have a ''final'' perfect parse and mapping rouUne We can make conUnual refinements at any stage of the process and exarmne the overall effect As m Senseval, we may make changes to deal wath a particular phenomenon with the result that overall performance dechnes, but w~th a sounder basis for making subsequent amprovements Results of Componential Analysis The ''gold standard'' analysis Involves mapping 66 WordNet senses with 348 words into 102 Hector senses with 1878 words Using the method described above, we obtained 35 out of 86 correct 3At the present tame, we use WordNet to adentffy semreis We envaslon usmg the full semanlac network created by parsing all a dlcUonary''s defimtaons Thas would include a richer set of semrels than currently included m WordNet 4The defimng patterns are developed by hand We have onlyJust begun this effort, so the current set ms somewhat Impoverished mappmgs (407%), a shght improvement over the 31 correct assignments usmg the stop-last word overlap techmque However, as mentioned above, the stophst techmque had aclueved 8 of its successes by matclung null assignments Consadered on tlus basins, ~t seems that the componentaal analysis techmque provides substantial ~mprovement In addition, our technique ''erred'' on 4 cases by malang assagnments where none were made by the leracographer We suggest that these cases do con~n some common elements of meaning and may conceivably not be construed as errors The mapping from WordNet to Hector had relatavely few empty mappings, senses for wtuch It was not possable to make an assignment These are the cases where at appears that the chetmnanes do not overlap and thus prowde a tentative mdacataon of where two dictionaries may have different coverage The cases of multiple assignments mchcate the degree ofamblgmty m the mapping The average m both darecUons between Hector and WordNet were donunated by the mabdaty to obtain good dascnnunatton for the word ''semze'' Thus, tlus method identifies individual words where the &scnnunatwe ablhty needs to be further refined  Perhaps more importantly, the componentml analysis method exploits consaderably more WordNet Hector  mformauon than the word overlap methods Whereas the stop-hst word overlap mapping was  based on only 41 content words, the componenual ~ approach (In the selected mappings) had 228 hits in ~.~  developing ats scores, with only a small number of ~ .~ ~ defining patterns Comparison of Dictionaries tel O ~3 0''3 We next exanuned the nature of the mterrelalaons between parrs of chctaonanes w~thout use of a ''gold standard'' to assess the process of mapping For t/us purpose, we mapped m both &recttons between the paars {WordNet, Hector}, {W3, OALD}, and {W3, AHD We exanune Dorr''s lexacal knowledge base for the amphcatlons It may have m the mapping process Neither WordNet nor Hector are properly v~ewed as chcuonanes, since there was no mtenuon to pubhsh them as such WordNet ''glosses'' are generally smaller (53 words per sense) compared to Hector (184 words per sense), whach contains many words specff3nng selectmnal restnct~ons on the subject and object of the verbs Hector was used primarily for a large-scale sense tagging project The three formal d~ctmnanes were subject to rigorous pubhslung and style standards The average number of words per sense were 87 (OALD), 7 1 (AHD), and 9 9 (W3), w~th an average of 3 4, 62, and 120 senses per word Each table shows the average number of senses being mapped, the average number of assignments m the target dlCtmnary, the average number of senses for which no assagnment could be made, the average number of mulUple assignments per word, and the average score of the assignments that were made WN-Hector 37 47 06 17 119 Hector-WN 57 64 14 22 113 These points are further emphasized m the mapping between W3 and OALD, where the disparity between the empty and mulUple assagnments indicate that we are mapping between dictionaries qmte disparate This tends to be the case not only for the enUre set of words, but also is evident for individual words where there is a considerable d~spanty m the number of senses, wtuch then dominate the overall dlspanty Thus, for example, W3 has 41 defimUons for ''float'', while OALD has 10 We tend to be unable to find the specific sense m going from W3 to OALD, because at is likely that we have many more specific defimtlons that are not present In the other direction, we are hkely to have considerable ambiguity and multiple assignments W3-OALD OALD-W3 W3 OALD 120 78 60 18 99 34 60 07 32 86 34 A Between W3 and AHD, there ss less overall daspanty between the defimtaon sets, although since W3 Is tmabndged, we stall have a relatavely lugh number of senses m W3 that do not appear to be present m AHD Finally, It should be noted that the scores for the published dictaonanes tend to be a little lower than for WordNet and Hector Tlus reflects the hkehhood that we have not extracted as much mformataon as we dad m parsing and analyzmg the defimtaon sets used m Senseval W3 AHD oJ  ''q O W3-AHD 120 115 40 36 90 AHD-W3 6 2 9 1 1 2 4 1 9 1 We next considered Dorr''s lexacal database We first transformed her theta grids to syntactic spectflcataons (transttave or lntransmttve) and identtficataon of semreis (e g, where she Identified an instr component, we added such a semrel to the DIMAP sense) We were able to identify a mappmg from WordNet to her senses for two words (''float'' and ''shake'') for wluch Dorr has several entries However, smce she has considerably more semanuc components than we are currently able to recogmze, we dad not pursue this avenue any further at flus time More important than just mappmg between two words, Dorr''s data mdacates the posstbday of further exploitation of a richer set of semanUc components Spectfically, as reported m (Olsen, et al, 1998), m descnbmg procedures for automatically acqumng thematic grids for Mandann Chinese, ~t was noted that ''verbs that incorporate themaUc elements m their meamng would not allow that element to appear m the complement structure'' Thus, by usmg Dorr''s thematic grids when verb are parsed m defimtaons, it ~s possible to ~dentffy where partacular semantac components are lexicahzed and which others are transnutted through to the themaUc grid (complement or subcategonzataon pattern) for the defimendum The transmiss~on of semantic components to the thematic gnd ~s also reflected overtly m many defimtlons For example, shake has one definition, ''to bnng to a specified condatton by or as ffby repeated qmck jerky movements'' We would thus expect that the thematac grid for this defimtaon should include a ''goal'' And, deed, Dorr''s database has two senses whch reqmre a ''goal'' as part of their thematic grid Smularly, for many defimtaons m the sample set, we ~dentLfied a source defimng pattern based on the word ''from,'' frequently, the object of the preposmon was the word ''source'' ttseff, mdacatmg that the subcategonzaUon, properties of the defimendum should elude a source component Discussion Wlule the improvement m mapping by using the componentaal analysis techmque (over the word overlap methods) is modest, we consider these results qmte slgmficant m wew of the very small number of defimng patterns we have Implemented Most of the improvement stems from the word substatuUon pnnclple described earlier (as ewdenced by the preponderance of 5 point scores) This techmque also provides a mechamsm for bnngmg back the stop words, wz, the preposmons, wluch are the careers of mformatmn about semrels (the 2 point scores) The more general conclusion (from the word subsutuuon) is that the success arises from no longer considenng a defimtmn m ~solation The proper context for a word and its defimtions consists not .lUSt of the words that make up the definition, but also the total semantac network represented by the dictaonary We have aclueved our results by explomng only a small part of that network We have moved only a few steps to that network beyond the mdawdual words and their definitions We would expect that further expansmn, first by the addon of further and ~mproved semrel defining patterns, and second, through the identaficataon of more pnmmve semanuc components, will add considerably to our abflay to map between lexacal resources We also expect ~mprovements from consideration of other techniques, such as attempts at ontology ahgnment (Hovy, 1998) Although tile definition analysis provlded here was performed on definmons with a stogie language, the vanous meamng components m m m m m m m m 35 correspond to those used in an Interhngua The use of the exUncuon method (developed m order to charactenze verbs m another language, Clunese) can frmtfully be applied here as well Two further observaUons about tlus process can be made The first is that rchance on a wellestablished semantic network such as WordNet,s not necessary The componenUal analysis method rehes on the local neighborhood of words m the defimUons, not on the completeness of the network Indeed, the network ~tsel can be bootstrapped based on the parsing results The method can work vath any semanUc network or ontology and may be used to refine or flesh out the network or ontology The second observation is that it is not necessary to have a well-estabhshed ''gold standard'' Any mapping vail do All that Is necessary is for any mvesugator (lemcographer or not) to create a judgmental mappmg The methods employed here can then quanufy ttus mapping based on a word overlap analysis and then further examine tt based on the componenaal analysis The componenUal analysis method can then be used to exanune underlying subtleUes and nuances tn the defimUous, wluch a lemcographer or analyst can then examine m further detail to assess the mapping Future Work Tlus work has marked the first ume that all the necessary mfrastructure has been combmed tn a rudimentary form Because of its rudimentary status, the opportumUes for improvement are quite extensive In addlUon, there are many opportumUes for using the techmques descnbed here m further NLP apphcatlons First, the techmques described here have immediate apphcabtllty as part of a lexicographer''s workstaUon When defimUons are parsed and semrels are zdenttfied, the resulUng data structures can be apphed against a corpus of instances for parUcular words (as m Senseval) for improving word-sense disamblguaUon The techmques will also permit comparing an entry vath Itself to deternune the mterrelattonshtps among ~ts defimUons and of companng the defimUons of two ''synonyms'' to deternune the amount of overlap between them on a defimtlon by defimUon bas~s Although the analys,s here has focused on the parsing of defimUous, the development of defimng patterns clearly extends to generalized text parsing since the defimng patterns have been incorporated mto the same chcttonary used for parsing free text, the patterns can be used threctly to identify the presence of parUcular semrels among sentenual consUtuents We are working to integrate th~s funcUonahty into our word-sense &sambiguaUon techruques (both the defimng patterns and the semrels) Even further, mt seems that matclung defimng patterns in free text can be used for lextcal acquisition Textual matenal that contains these patterns could concewably be flagged as providing defimUonal matenal which can then be compared to emstmg defimUons to assess whether their use ts cous,stent vath these defimUons, and ff not, at least to flag the inconsistency The tecluuques descnbed here can be apphed directly to the fields of ontology development and analysis of ternunologlcal databases For ontoiogles, vath or w~thout defimuons, the methods employed can be used to compare entries m dai''erent ontologles based pnmanly on the relattous m the ontology, both luerarclucal and other For ternunologlcal databases, the methods descnbed here can be used to exanune the set of conceptual relaUons lmphed by the defimtmus The defimuon parsing wall facd~tate the development of the termmolog~ca I network tn the pamcular field covered by the database The componenUal analysts methods result m a richer semantic network that can be used m other apphcattous Thus, for example, ~t ts possible to extend the leracal chatmng methods described m (Green, 1997), which are based on the semrels used m WordNet The semrels developed with the componenttal analysis method would provide additional detad available for apphcauon of lexlcal cohesion methods In particular, addtUonal relattous would penmt some structunng wmthm the individual leracal chams, rather than just consldenng each cham as an amorphous set (Green, 1999) Finally, we are currently investigating the use of the componenUal analysts techmque for mformauon extracUon The techmque identifies (from defimtlous) slots that can be used as slots or fields m template generataon Once these slots are identified, we wall be attemptmg to extract slot values from Items m large catalog databases (mdhons of items) 36 In conclusion, it would seem that, instead of a paucity of tnformation allovang us to compare lexmal resources, by bnngmg m the full semantic network of the lexicon, we are overwhelmed with a plethora of data Acknowledgments I would like to thank Bonnie Dorr,

'This is contrastive to the one dimensional models used by Collinss perceptronbased sequence method <CIT> which our algorithms are based upon , and by the linear-chain CRFs '
'The phrase translation table is learned in the following manner : The parallel corpus is word-aligned bidirectionally , and using various heuristics -LRB- see <CIT> for details -RRB- phrase correspondences are established '
'For example , the words test and exam are similar because both of them follow verbs such as administer , cancel , cheat on , conduct , and both of them can be preceded by adjectives such as academic , comprehensive , diagnostic , difficult , Many methods have been proposed to compute distributional similarity between words <CIT> '

'In the LFG-based generation algorithm presented by <CIT> complex named entities -LRB- ie those consisting of more than one word token -RRB- and other multi-word units can be fragmented in the surface realization '
'All submitted runs were evaluated with the automatic metrics : ROUGE <CIT> , which calculates the proportion of n-grams shared between the candidate summary and the reference summaries , and Basic Elements <OTH> , which compares the candidate to the models in terms of head-modifier pairs '
'2 Latent Variable Parsing In latent variable parsing <CIT> , we learn rule probabilities on latent annotations that , when marginalized out , maximize the likelihood of the unannotated training trees '

'<CIT> used bootstrapping to extend their semantic compatibility model , which they called contextual-role knowledge , by identifying certain cases of easily-resolved anaphors and antecedents '
'For comparison purposes , we consider two different algorithms for our AnswerExtraction module : one that does not bridge the lexical chasm , based on N-gram cooccurrences between the question terms and the answer terms ; and one that attempts to bridge the lexical chasm using Statistical Machine Translation inspired techniques <CIT> in order to find the best answer for a given question '
'a1 Graduated in March 2006 Standard phrase-based translation systems use a word distance-based reordering model in which non-monotonic phrase alignment is penalized based on the word distance between successively translated source phrases without considering the orientation of the phrase alignment or the identities of the source and target phrases <CIT> '

'Next , we learn our polarity classifier using positive and negative reviews taken from two movie 611 review datasets , one assembled by <CIT> and the other by ourselves '
'Sentiment classification is a well studied problem <CIT> and in many domains users explicitly 1We use the term aspect to denote properties of an object that can be rated by a user as in Snyder and Barzilay <OTH> '
'In contrast , semi-supervised domain adaptation <CIT> is the scenario in which , in addition to the labeled source data , we only have unlabeled and no labeled target domain data '

lexicographers taggrog the word senses (Kllgamff, 1998c, Kllgarnff, 1998a, Kflgarrlff, 1998b) 2 A Case Study In this-paper, we examine the ~ssue of raterannotator agreement by comparing the agreement rate of human annotators on a large sense-tagged corpus of more than 30,000 instances of the most frequently occurring nouns and verbs of Enghsh This corpus is the intersection of the WORDNET Semcor corpus (Miller et al, 1993) and the DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996, Ng, 1997), which has been independently tagged wlth the refined senses of WORDNET by two separate groups of human annotators The

the senses from WORDNET 1 6, whereas the senses used m the DSO corpus were from WoRDNET 15 1 To match the sentences, we first converted the senses m the DSO corpus to those of WORDNET 1 6 We ignored all sentences m the DSO corpus m which a word is tagged with sense 0 or -1 (A word is tagged with sense 0 or -1 ff none of the given senses m WoRDNFT applies ) 4, sentence from Semcor is considered to

agreement (Bruce and Wmbe, 1998, Carletta, 1996, Veroms, 1998) Let Cj be the sum of the number of sentences which have been assigned sense 3 by annotator 1 and the number of sentences whmh have been assigned sense 3 by annotator 2 Then P~-P~ 1-P~ where M j=l and Pe measures the chance agreement between two annotators A Kappa ~alue of 0 indicates that the agreement is purely due to chance agreement, whereas a Kappa ~alue of 1 indicates perfect agreement A Kappa ~alue of 0 8 and above is considered as mdmatmg good agreement (Carletta, 1996) Table 1 summarizes the inter-annotator agreement on the mtersected corpus The first (becond) row denotes agreement on the nouns (xerbs), wh~le the lass row denotes agreement on all words combined The a~erage ~ reported m the table is a s~mpie average of the individual ~ value of each word The agreement rate on the 30,315 sentences as measured by P= is 57% This tallies with the figure reported ~n our earlier paper (Ng and Lee, 1996)

the intersected corpus is not high, we would like to find out how the agreement rate would be affected if different sense classes were in use In this section, we present a greedy search algorithm that can automatmalb derive coarser sense classes based on the sense tags assigned by two human annotators The resulting derived coarse sense classes achmve a higher agreement rate but we still maintain as many of the original sense classes as possible The algorithm is given m Figure 1 The algorithm operates on a set of sentences where each sentence contains an occurrence of the word w whmh has been sense-tagged by two human annotators At each Iteration of the algorithm, tt finds the pair of sense classes Ct and Cj such that merging these two sense classes results in the highest t~ value for the resulting merged group of sense classes It then proceeds to merge Cz and C~ Thin process Is repeated until the ~ value reaches a satisfactory value ~,~t,~, which we set as 0 8 Note that this algorithm is also applicable to deriving any coarser set of classes from a refined set for any NLP tasks in which prior human agreement rate may not be high enough Such NLP tasks could be discourse tagging, speech-act categorization, etc 6 Results For each word w from the list of 121 nouns and 70 verbs, ~e applied the greedy search algorithm to each set of sentences in the intersected corpus contaming w For a subset of 95 words (53 nouns and 42 verbs), the algorithm was able to derive a coarser set of 2 or more senses for each of these 95 words such that the resulting Kappa ~alue reaches 0 8 or higher For the other 96 words, m order for the Kappa value to reach 0 8 or higher, the algorithm collapses all senses of the ~ord to a single (trivial) class Table 2 and 3 summarizes the results for the set of 53 nouns and 42 ~erbs, respectively Table 2 md~cates that before the collapse of sense classes, these 53 nouns have an average of 7 6 senses per noun There is a total of 5,339 sentences in the intersected corpus containing these nouns, of which 3,387 sentences were assigned the same sense by the two groups of human annotators The average Kappa statistic (computed as a simple average of the Kappa statistic of ~he mdlwdual nouns) is 0 463 After the collapse of sense classes by the greedy search algorithm, the average number of senses per noun for these 53 nouns drops to 40 Howe~er, the number of sentences which have been asmgned the same coarse sense by the annotators increases to 5,033 That is, about 94 3% of the sentences have been assigned the same coarse sense, and that the average Kappa statistic has improved to 0 862, mgmfymg high rater-annotator agreement on the derived coarse senses Table3 gl~es the analogous figures for the 42 verbs, agmn mdmatmg that high agreement is achieved on the coarse sense classes den~ed for verbs 7 Discussion Our findings on rater-annotator agreement for word sense tagging indicate that for average language users, it is quite dl~cult to achieve high agreement when they are asked to assign refned sense tags (such as those found in WORDNET) given only the scanty definition entries m the WORDNET dlctionary and a few or no example sentences for the usage of each word sense Thin observation agrees wlth that obtmned m a recent study done by (Veroms, 1998), where the agreement on sense-tagging by naive users was also not hlgh Thus It appears that an average language user is able to process language wlthout needing to perform the task of dlsamblguatmg word sense to a very fine-grained resolutmn as formulated m a tradltlonal dmtlonary In contrast, expert lexicographers tagged the ~ ord sense in the sentences used m the SENSEVAL exerclse, where high rater-annotator agreement was reported There are also fuller dlctlonary entries m the HECTOR dlctlonary used and more e<amples showing the usage of each word sense m HECTOR These factors are likely to have contributed to the difference in rater-annotator agreement observed m the three studies conducted We also examined the coarse sense classes derived by the greedy search algorithm Vv''e found some interesting groupings of coarse senses for nouns which ~e hst in Table 4 From Table 4, it is apparent that the greedy search algorithm can derive interesting groupings of word senses that correspond to human mtmtwe judgment of sense graz}.ulanty It Is clear that some of the disagreement between the two groups of human annotators can be attributed solely to the overly refined senses of WoRDNET As an example, there is a total Ii loop: let Ct,, C M denote the current M sense classes ~* +--oo for all z,3 such that 1 <, < 3 < M let C[,,C~w_ 1 denote the resulting M 1 sense classes by mergmg C, and C 3 compute ~(C[,, C~/_t) ff ~(C,, C~4_x) > ~* then ~''

'We can confirm that changing the dimensionality parameter h has rather little effect -LRB- Table 4 -RRB- , which is in line with previous findings <CIT> '
'This includes both the parsers that attach probabilities to parser moves <OTH> , but also those of the lexicalized PCFG variety <CIT> '
'We also test our language model using leave-one-out cross-validation on the Penn Treebank <CIT> -LRB- WSJ -RRB- , giving us 8674 % accuracy -LRB- see Table 1 -RRB- '
'Classes can be induced directly from the corpus <CIT> or taken from a manually crafted taxonomy <OTH> '
'32 System Combination Scheme In our work , we use a sentence-level system combination model to select best translation hypothesis from the candidate pool -LRB- -RRB- This method can also be viewed to be a hypotheses reranking model since we only use the existing translations instead of performing decoding over a confusion network as done in the word-level combination method <CIT> '
'Methods have been proposed for automatic evaluation in MT -LRB- eg , BLEU <CIT> -RRB- '
'Some work identifies inflammatory texts -LRB- eg , <OTH> -RRB- or classifies reviews as positive or negative -LRB- <CIT> -RRB- '
'<CIT> put forward and discussed n-gram models based on classes of words '
'<OTH> develop a bottom-up decoder for BTG <CIT> that uses only phrase pairs '
'We use maximum marginal decoding , which <CIT> reports performs better than Viterbi decoding '
'On the machine-learning side , it would be interesting to generalize the ideas of large-margin classi cation to sequence models , strengthening the results of <CIT> and leading to new optimal training algorithms with stronger guarantees against over tting '
'Therefore , domain adaptation methods have recently been proposed in several NLP areas , eg , word sense disambiguation <OTH> , statistical parsing <OTH> , and lexicalized-grammar parsing <OTH> '

'We believe the benefit to limiting the size of n is connected to <CIT> observation that as n increases , the accuracy of an n-gram model increases , but the reliability of our parameter estimates , drawn as they must be from a limited training text , decreases '
'Several artificial techniques have been used so that classifiers can be developed and tested without having to invest in manually tagging the data : <CIT> and Sch\/itze -LRB- 1995 -RRB- have acquired training and testing materials by creating pseudowords from existing nonhomographic forms '

'In contrast , the latter computes four definite probabilities which are included as features within a machine-learning classifier from the Web in an attempt to overcome <CIT> data sparseness problem '
'216 The Maximum Entropy Principle <CIT> is to nd a model p = argmax pC H -LRB- p -RRB- , which means a probability model p -LRB- y x -RRB- that maximizes entropy H -LRB- p -RRB- '
'A similar use of the term phrase exists in machine translation , where phrases are often pairs of word sequences consistent with word-based alignments <CIT> '
'Accurate measurement of semantic similarity between lexical units such as words or phrases is important for numerous tasks in natural language processing such as word sense disambiguation <OTH> , synonym extraction <CIT> , and automatic thesauri generation <OTH> '

'In addition to portability experiments with the parsing model of <CIT> , <OTH> provided a comprehensive analysis of parser portability '
'Since parsing is just an initial stage of natural language understanding , the project was focused not just on obtaining syntactic trees alone -LRB- as is done in many other parsed corpora , for example , Penn TreeBank <CIT> or Tiger <OTH> -RRB- '
'There exists a variety of different metrics , eg , word error rate , position-independent word error rate , BLEU score <CIT> , NIST score <OTH> , METEOR <OTH> , GTM <OTH> '
'In this work , model fit is reported in terms of the likelihood ratio statistic , G 2 , and its significance <CIT> '
'Two main approaches have generally been considered : rule-based <OTH> probabilistic <CIT> '
'<OTH> -RRB- , and distributional methods -LRB- eg , <CIT> et al '
'33 Corpora Our labeled data comes from the Penn Treebank <CIT> and consists of about 40,000 sentences from Wall Street Journal -LRB- WSJ -RRB- articles 153 annotated with syntactic information '
'2 System Description 21 Data Representation In this paper , we change the representation of the original data as follows : Bracketed representation of roles is converted into IOB2 representation <OTH> Word tokens are collapsed into base phrase -LRB- BP -RRB- tokens '
'Models that support non-monotonic decoding generally include a distortion cost , such as aibi11 where ai is the starting position of the foreign phrasefi andbi1 is the ending position of phrase fi1 <CIT> '
'The transcription probabilities can then be easily learned from the alignments induced by GIZA + + , using a scoring function <CIT> '
'Further , we can learn the channel probabilities in an unsupervised manner using a variant of the EM algorithm similar to machine translation <CIT> , and statistical language understanding <OTH> '
'<CIT> and Uryupina -LRB- 2003 -RRB- have already employed a definite probability measure in a similar way , although the way the ratio is computed is slightly different '
'Partitioning 2 : Medium and low frequency words As noted in <CIT> , log-likelihood statistics are able to capture word bi-gram regularities '
'Perhaps this was not observed earlier since <CIT> studied only base NPs , most of which are short '
'Previous work from <OTH> showed improvements in perplexity-oriented measures using mixture-based translation lexicon <CIT> '
'2 Learning algorithm The translation model is a standard linear model <CIT> , which we train using MIRA <OTH> , following Watanabe et al '
'However , in the Grammar Association context , when developing -LRB- using Bayes decomposition -RRB- the basic equations of the system presented in <OTH> , it is said that the reverse model for a28 a13a37a3a38a5a39a32a21a0a35a7 does not seem to admit a simple factorization which is also correct and convenient , so crude heuristics were adopted in the mathematical development of the expression to be maximized '
'The translation and reference files are analyzed by a treebank-based , probabilistic Lexical-Functional Grammar -LRB- LFG -RRB- parser <CIT> , which produces a set of dependency triples for each input '
'The use of such relations -LRB- mainly relations between verbs or nouns and their arguments and modifiers -RRB- for various purposes has received growing attention in recent research <CIT> '
'This amounts to performing binary text categorization under categories Objective and Subjective <CIT> ; 2 '
'In contrast , semi-supervised domain adaptation <CIT> is the scenario in which , in addition to the labeled source data , we only have unlabeled and no labeled target domain data '
'With the success of collaborative sites like Amazons Mechanical Turk 1 , one 1http : \/ \/ wwwmturkcom \/ 59 can provide the task of annotation to multiple oracles on the internet <CIT> '
'Still , a confidence range for BLEU can be estimated by bootstrapping <CIT> '
'Some authors have already designed similar matching techniques , such as the ones described in <OTH> and <CIT> '
'The feature templates in <CIT> that were left out were the ones that look at the previous word , the word two positions before the current , and the word two positions after the current '
'In our case , we computed a likelihood ratio score <CIT> for all pairs of English tokens and Inuktitut substrings of length ranging from 3 to 10 characters '
'More recently , Haffari and Sarkar <OTH> have extended the work of <CIT> and given a better mathematical understanding of self-training algorithms '
'Word alignments are provided by GIZA + + <CIT> with grow-diag-final combination , with infrastructure for alignment combination and phrase extraction provided by the shared task '
'As a result , they are being used in a variety of applications , such as question answering <OTH> , speech recognition <OTH> , language modeling <OTH> , language generation <OTH> and , most notably , machine translation <CIT> '
'By labeling Treeb ~ n ~ nodes with Gr ~ ramar rule names , and not with phrasal and clausal n ~ raes , as in other -LRB- non-gr ~ rarnar-based -RRB- treebanks '' <CIT> , we gain access to all information provided by the Grammar regarding each ~ reebank node '
'The usefulness of likelihood ratios for collocation detection has been made explicit by <CIT> and has been confirmed by an evaluation of various collocation detection methods carried out by Evert and Krenn <OTH> '
'We use maximum entropy modeling <CIT> to directly model the conditional probability a17a19a18a20a2a21a15a23a22a24a26a25 , where each a27a5a15 in a24a29a28a30a18a31a27a32a4a33a6a7a8a9a8a9a8a9a6a23a27a34a11a14a25 is an observation associated with the corresponding speaker a2 a15 a27 a15 is represented here by only one variable for notational ease , but it possibly represents several lexical , durational , structural , and acoustic observations '
'Although we have argued -LRB- section 2 -RRB- that this is unlikely to succeed , to our knowledge , we are the first to investigate the matter empirically11 The best-known MT aligner is undoubtedly GIZA + + <OTH> , which contains implementations of various IBM models <CIT> , as well as the HMM model of Vogel et al '
'Since text planners can not generate either the requisite syntactic variation or quantity of text , <OTH> developed an evaluation strategy for HALOGEN employing a substitute : sentence parses from the Penn TreeBank <CIT> , a corpus that includes texts from newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal , and which have been hand-annotated for syntax by linguists '

'Introduction Since Eric Brill first introduced the method of Transformation-Based Learning -LRB- TBL -RRB- it has been used to learn rules for many natural language processing tasks , such as part-of-speech tagging <OTH> , PPattachment disambiguation <OTH> , text chunking <CIT> , spelling correction <OTH> , dialogue act tagging <OTH> and ellipsis resolution <OTH> '
'For nonprojective parsing , the analogy to the inside algorithm is the O -LRB- n3 -RRB- matrix-tree algorithm , which is dominated asymptotically by a matrix determinant <CIT> '
'GIZA + + <CIT> and the heuristics grow-diag-final-and are used to generate m-ton word alignments '
'The translation probability can also be discriminatively trained such as in <CIT> '
'To help our model learn that it is desirable to copy answer words into the question , we add to each corpus a list of identical dictionary word pairs w iw i For each corpus , we use GIZA <OTH> , a publicly available SMT package that implements the IBM models <CIT> , to train a QA noisy-channel model that maps flattened answer parse trees , obtained using the cut procedure described in Section 31 , into questions '
'4 Data Collection We evaluated out method by running RASP over Brown Corpus and Wall Street Journal , as contained in the Penn Treebank <CIT> '
'translation systems <CIT> and use Moses <OTH> to search for the best target sentence '
'51 Comparison to self-training For completeness , we also compared our results to the self-learning algorithm , which has commonly been referred to as bootstrapping in natural language processing and originally popularized by the work of Yarowsky in word sense disambiguation <CIT> '
'The acquisition of clues is a key technology in these research efforts , as seen in learning methods for document-level SA <OTH> and for phraselevel SA <CIT> '
'Re-decoding <CIT> based regeneration re-decodes the source sentence using original LM as well as new trans105 lation and reordering models that are trained on the source-to-target N-best translations generated in the first pass '
'Following <CIT> , the slot labels are drawn from a set of classes constructed by extending each label by three additional symbols , Beginning\/Inside\/Outside -LRB- B\/I\/O -RRB- '

'These were combined using the Grow Diag Final And symmetrization heuristic <CIT> '
'If the target CFG is purely binary branching , then the previous theoretical and linguistic analyses <CIT> suggest that much of the requisite constituent and word order transposition may be accommodated without change to the mirrored ITG '
'First , we considered single sentences as documents , and tokens as sentences -LRB- we define a token as a sequence of characters delimited by 1In our case , the score we seek to globally maximize by dynamic programming is not only taking into account the length criteria described in <OTH> but also a cognate-based one similar to <OTH> '
'For the maximum entropy classifier , we estimate the weights by maximizing the likelihood of a heldout set , using the standard IIS algorithm <CIT> '
'22 The Crossing Constraint According to <CIT> , crossing constraint can be defined in the following '
'<CIT> attain 982 % coverage and a BLEU score of 06652 on the standard WSJ test set -LRB- Section 23 -RRB- '
'Previous publications on Meteor <CIT> have described the details underlying the metric and have extensively compared its performance with Bleu and several other MT evaluation metrics '
'1 Word associations -LRB- co-occurrences , or joint frequencies -RRB- have a wide range of applications including : speech recognition , optical character recognition , and information retrieval -LRB- IR -RRB- <CIT> '
'(Snow et al., 2006; Nakov & Hearst, 2008).'
'Our study is also different from these previous ones in that measuring the agreement among annotators became an issue <CIT> '
'Our approach differs from the corpus-based surface generation approaches of <OTH> and <CIT> '
'In our experiments we use a grammar with a start symbol S , a single preterminal C , and two nonterminals A and B used to ensure that only one parse can generate any given word-level alignment -LRB- ignoring insertions and deletions -RRB- <CIT> '
'There are good reasons for using such a hand-crafted , genre-specific verb lexicon instead of a general resource such as WordNet or Levins <OTH> classes : Many verbs used in the domain of scientific argumentation have assumed a specialized meaning , which our lexicon readily encodes '
'Here , we compare two similarity measures : the familiar BLEU score <CIT> and a score based on string kernels '
'Although this approach can give inaccurate estimates , the counts given to the incorrect senses will disperse randomly throughout the hierarchy as noise , and by accumulating counts up the hierarchy we will tend to gather counts from the correct senses of related words <OTH> '
'Most probabilistic parsing research including , for example , work by by <CIT> , and Charniak -LRB- 1997 -RRB- is based on branching process models <OTH> '
'2 Baseline Coreference Resolution System Our baseline coreference system implements the standard machine learning approach to coreference resolution -LRB- see Ng and Cardie <OTH> , <CIT> , Yang and Su -LRB- 2007 -RRB- , for instance -RRB- , which consists of probabilistic classification and clustering , as described below '
'The training and decoding system of our SMT used the publicly available Pharaoh <CIT> 2 '
'<CIT> propose factored translation models that combine feature functions to handle syntactic , morphological , and other linguistic information in a log-linear model '
'This therefore suggests that better parameters are likely to be learned in the 2 <CIT> generative coreference model mirrors this in the posterior distribution which it assigns to mention types given their salience -LRB- see their Table 1 -RRB- '
'1 Introduction Over the last few years , several automatic metrics for machine translation -LRB- MT -RRB- evaluation have been introduced , largely to reduce the human cost of iterative system evaluation during the development cycle <CIT> '
'Most of the annotation approaches tackling these issues , however , are aimed at performing classifications at either the document level <CIT> , or the sentence or word level <OTH> '
'This logistic regression is also called Maxent as it finds the distribution with maximum entropy that properly estimates the average of each feature over the training data <CIT> '
'The idea of threading EEs to their antecedents in a stochastic parser was proposed by <CIT> , following the GPSG tradition <OTH> '
'The mutual information clustering algorithm <CIT> were used for this '
'1993 ; Chang et al , 1992 ; Collins and Brooks , 1995 ; Fujisaki , 1989 ; Hindle and Rooth , 1991 ; Hindle and Rooth , 1993 ; Jelinek et al , 1990 ; Magerman and <CIT> , 1991 ; Magerman , 1995 ; Ratnaparkhi et al , 1994 ; Resnik , 1993 ; Su and Chang , 1988 -RRB- '
'Building on the annotations from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), the project added several new layers of semantic annotations, such as coreference information, word senses, etc. In its first release (LDC2007T21) through the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), the project manually sense-tagged more than 40,000 examples belonging to hundreds of noun and verb types with an ITA of 90%, based on a coarse-grained sense inventory, where each word has an average of only 3.2 senses.'
'Using a variant of the voted perceptron <CIT> , we discriminatively trained our parser in an on-line fashion '
'The approach combines statistical and knowledge-based methods , but unlike many recent corpus-based approaches to sense disambiguation <OTH> , it takes as its starting point the assumption that senseannotated training text is not available '
'Traditionally , maximum-likelihood estimation from relative frequencies is used to obtain conditional probabilities <CIT> , eg , p -LRB- s t -RRB- = c -LRB- s , t -RRB- \/ summationtexts c -LRB- s , t -RRB- -LRB- since the estimation problems for p -LRB- s t -RRB- and p -LRB- t s -RRB- are symmetrical , we will usually refer only to p -LRB- s t -RRB- for brevity -RRB- '
'<OTH> and Lee <OTH> -RRB- can be generally divided into three types : discounting <OTH> , class-based smoothing <CIT> , and distance-weighted averaging <OTH> '
'Many existing systems for statistical machine translation <OTH> implement models presented by <CIT> : The correspondence between the words in the source and the target strings is described by alignments that assign target word positions to each source word position '
'However , they do not elaborate on how the comparisons are done , or on how effective the program is <CIT> describes a heuristic approach to forming unlabeled clusters of closely related senses in an MRD '
'<OTH> , various classification models and linguistic features have been proposed to improve the classification performance <CIT> '
'One of the simplest models in the context of lexical triggers is the IBM model 1 <CIT> which captures lexical dependencies between source and target words '
'grow-diagfinal <CIT> -RRB- '
'<OTH> , <CIT> -RRB- and the exploitation of advanced techniques that involve joint learning -LRB- eg , Daume III and Marcu <OTH> -RRB- and joint inference -LRB- eg , Denis and Baldridge <OTH> -RRB- for coreference resolution and a related extraction task '
'This permits us to make exact comparisons with the parser of Yamada and Matsumoto <OTH> , but also the parsers of <CIT> and Charniak -LRB- 2000 -RRB- , which are evaluated on the same data set in Yamada and Matsumoto <OTH> '
'In fact , the largest source of English dependency trees is automatically generated from the Penn Treebank <CIT> and is by convention exclusively projective '
'Normally , :8 is considered a good agreement <CIT> '
'Recent work <CIT> on this task explored a variety of methodologies to address this issue '
'The maximum entropy models used here are similar in form to those in <CIT> '
'Our baseline is the phrase-based MT system of <CIT> '
'We will provide a more detailed and systematic comparison between MAXIMUM ENTROPY MODELING <OTH> and MEMORY BASED LEARNING <OTH> for morpho-syntactic disambiguation and we investigate whether earlier observed differences in tagging accuracy can be attributed to algorithm bias , information source issues or both '
'So we propose forest reranking , a technique inspired by forest rescoring <CIT> that approximately reranks the packed forest of exponentially many parses '
'We use the standard NIST MTEval data sets for the years 2003 , 2004 and 2005 -LRB- henceforth MT03 , MT04 and MT05 , respectively -RRB- 6 We report results in terms of case-insensitive 4gram BLEU <CIT> scores '
'We adopted the chunk representation proposed by <CIT> and used four different tags : B-NUC and B-SAT for nucleus and satellite-initial tokens , and I-NUC and I-SAT for non-initial tokens , ie , tokens inside a nucleus and satellite span '
'Figures 1 and 2 present best results in the learning experiments for the complete set of patterns used in the collocation approach , over two of our evaluation corpora11 Type Positions Tags\/Words Features Accuracy Precision Recall GIS 1 W 1254 097 096 098 IIS 1 T 136 095 096 094 NB 1 T 136 088 097 084 9 see Rish , 2001 , Ratnaparkhi , 1997 and <CIT> et al , 1996 for a formal description of these algorithms '
'Tag test data using the POS-tagger described in <CIT> '
'In <OTH> , <CIT> the significance of an association -LRB- x , y -RRB- is measured by the mutual information I -LRB- x , y -RRB- , ie the probability of observing x and y together , compared with the probability of observing x and y independently '
'The precision rate using the lexical statistics approach can reach around 60 % if both word bi-gram extraction and n-gram extractions are taking into account <CIT> '
'Many methods exist for clustering , eg , <CIT> '
'The weights for these models are determined using the method described in <CIT> '
'TopSense is tested on 20 words extensively investigated in recent WSD literature <CIT> '
'But there is also extensive research focused on including linguistic knowledge in metrics <CIT> among others '
'<CIT> studied a method for word sense disambiguation using unlabeled data '
'Obtaining a word-aligned corpus usually involves training a word-based translation models <CIT> in each directions and combining the resulting alignments '
'The other utilizes a sort of parallel texts , such as multiple translation of the same text <CIT> , corresponding articles from multiple news sources <CIT> , and bilingual corpus <OTH> '
'For ROUGE-S and ROUGE-SU , we use three variations following <CIT> : the maximum skip distances are 4 , 9 and infinity 7 '
'Finally , other approaches rely on reviews with numeric ratings from websites <CIT> and train -LRB- semi - -RRB- supervised learning algorithms to classify reviews as positive or negative , or in more fine-grained scales <CIT> '
'The first one makes use of the advances in the parsing technology or on the availability of large parsed corpora -LRB- eg Trcebank <CIT> -RRB- to produce algorithms inspired by Hobbs '' baseline method <OTH> '
'The probabilities are ordered according to , at least my , intuition with pronoun being the most likely <OTH> , followed by proper nouns <OTH> , followed by common nouns <OTH> , a fact also noted by <CIT> '
'Therefore , structure divergence and parse errors are two of the major issues that may largely compromise the performance of syntax-based SMT <CIT> '
'Work focusses on analyzing subjective features of text or speech , such as sentiment , opinion , emotion or point of view <CIT> '
'The NIST BLEU-4 is a variant of BLEU <CIT> and is computed as a49a51a50 a2a16a52a53a6 a0a9a8a10a0a12a11a54a13a55a15 a26a57a56a33a58a60a59 a43 a61a63a62 a64 a65a67a66a69a68 a28a71a70a46a72a74a73 a65 a6 a0a9a8a10a0a3a11a54a13a19a75a77a76 a6 a0a9a8a10a0a3a11a54a13 -LRB- 2 -RRB- where a73 a65 a6 a0a78a8a10a0a3a11a54a13 is the precision of a79 - grams in the hypothesis a0 given the reference a0 a11 and a76 a6 a0a78a8a10a0a3a11a54a13a81a80 a43 is a brevity penalty '
'1 Introduction Inversion transduction grammar -LRB- ITG -RRB- constraints <CIT> provide coherent structural constraints on the relationship between a sentence and its translation '
'Examples of this are bilexical grammars -- such as Eisner and Satta <OTH> , Charniak <OTH> , <CIT> <OTH> -- where the lexical heads of each constituent are annotated on both the rightand left-hand sides of the context-free rules , under the constraint that every constituent inherits the lexical head from exactly one of its children , and the lexical head of a POS is its terminal item '
'For a second set of parsing experiments , we used the WSJ portion of the Penn Tree Bank <CIT> and Helmut Schmids enrichment program tmod <OTH> '
'To this end we follow the method introduced by <CIT> , ie by sliding a window of a given size over some texts '
'The MBT POS tagger <OTH> is used to provide POS information '
'In this paper , we modify the method in Albrecht and Hwa <OTH> to only prepare human reference translations for the training examples , and then evaluate the translations produced by the subject systems against the references using BLEU score <CIT> '
'The model weights are trained using the standard ranking perceptron <CIT> '
'Carletta suggests that content analysis researchers consider K -RRB- 8 as good reliability , with67 -LRB- \/ ~ '' -LRB- 8 allowing tentative conclusions to be drawn <CIT> '

Such an approach demonstrates large disagreements between different experts and low detection levels of relatively small tumors (of size in the range of pixels) [2]_CITE
These include a fuzzy set based algorithm [3]_CITE that allows the detection of healthy brain substructures with a precision of 95% measured with the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) [4]_CITE
"Another method designed for the same task, but based on self-organizing maps technique (SOM) [5]_CITE, demonstrates an accuracy of 80% measured with the Tanimoto index (TI)"
"Examples of such methods include: template moderate classification proposed by Kaus et al [7]_CITE, a method based on fluid vector flow by Lee et al [8]_CITE or a generative model based method proposed by Prastawa et al [9]_CITE"

"Admittedly, there are no detailed studies on ADC distribution for brain tumours at different stages, but it has been shown that in squamous cell carcinoma ADC in viable tumour remained constant independent of tumour stage, while areas with an increased ADC correlated well with areas of necrosis (reduced cell density) [43]_CITE"
"According to the WHO, the family of astrocytomas tumours, a subgroup of gliomas originated from abnormal astrocytic cells, is divided into the following four groups with respect to the increasing malignancy [44]_CITE: Grade I, Pilocytic astrocytoma; Grade II, Astrocytoma fibrillare and oligodendrogiomas; Grade III, Oligoastrocytoma; Grade IV, Glioblastoma (also named as glioblastoma multiforme)."
"However, the absence of enhancement does not necessarily imply a histopathologic diagnosis of low-grade tumor: one-third of nonenhancing diffuse gliomas in adults are high-grade tumors [45]_CITE"
"The ADC, which quantifies overall diffusion occurring within each voxel and is affected not only by the volume of the extravascular extracellular space but also by its spatial configuration, is able to detect early microstructural tissue changes associated with cell death [46]_CITE"
"In tumors, the ADC is usually highest in cystic or necrotic areas then in solid tumor components [47]_CITE."
"In addition, ADC changes due to the presence of cystic, necrotic, and/or hemorrhagic areas and the influence of artifacts caused by inhomogeneous structures such as the skull base bone and sinus air must be considered [48]_CITE"
"Among the stochastic optimization algorithms are the genetic algorithm with floating-point representation (GAF) developed by Michalewicz [1]_CITE, and the shuffled complex evolution algorithm (SCE-UA) proposed by Duan [2]_CITE, both investigated in this study"
"In other hand, the SCE-UA method is a global-searching algorithm developed by Duan et al [3,4]_CITE"
"It adopts competition evolution theory [5]_CITE, complex shuffling method, and replacing the Downhill Simplex method [6]_CITE, to obtain a global optimal estimation"
De Jong [7]_CITE experimentally developed a heuristic for GA with one-point crossover and bit mutation which proved to be efficient for some problems
Later studies was performed in Grefenstette [8]_CITE using a metagenetic algorithm to find suitable parameter values or using exhaustive testing
"Studies concerning the performance analysis, parameterization and setting of genetic algorithms approaches were made by Caruana et al [9]_CITE, Eshelman et al [10]_CITE and Schaffer et al [11]_CITE"
"In B ck [12]_CITE, test functions were investigated finding the optimum with fast convergence"
"B ck [13]_CITE made some tests indicating that GA performance is decreasing for population size bigger than 200 combined with mutation probability bigger than 0.05, as well as for population size less than 20 combined with mutation probability equals to 0.002"
"Patton et al [14]_CITE investigated the size population, 200 and 500, applied in evolutionary computation"
Salomon [15]_CITE analyzed the benefits of small mutation rates and focuses on the performance loss of GA when applying a rotation to the coordinate system
"Recently other researchers, Hwang and He [17]_CITE, Jianhua et al [18]_CITE, and Dipti [19]_CITE also employed genetic algorithms for unconstrained optimization"
"Already, SCE-UA has been used extensively in hydrology area (Duan [2]_CITE, Duan et al [3]_CITE, Yapo et al [20]_CITE, Ajami et al [21]_CITE, Skahill and Doherty [22]_CITE)."
"Finally, other important research carried out by Yang et al [25]_CITE, Liang et al [26]_CITE, Li et al [27]_CITE, Jie et al [28]_CITE, Yuchi and Kim [29]_CITE, and Park et al [30]_CITE."

"The SCE-UA method is a general-purpose global optimization algorithm designed to infer the traditional best parameter set and its underlying posterior distribution within a single optimization run (Vrugt et al [34]_CITE, Duan et al [35]_CITE)"
It is important mention here that the Rosenbrock function can be treated as a multimodal problem [50]_CITE
This function contains millions of local optima in the interval of consideration [51]_CITE
"Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks (WMSNs) comprise a technological field that has arisen as the natural evolution from the conventional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), composed of only a few nodes, to large-scale networks in which sources and destinations are interconnected through different paths of intermediate nodes forming a mesh layout [1]_CITE"
"To this end, new mesh capabilities such as multi-hop mesh routing, scalability, robustness, reliability, self-organization or energy efficiency must be satisfied [2]_CITE"
"In this sense, advances in WMSNs over the next few years will be addressed to the design, development and integration of all these capabilities into a single standard mesh solution which, in turn, will ensure a strong boost of this technology in a wide range of areas, such as automation and control (home and industrial), environmental surveillance, precision agriculture, traffic monitoring, or health services [1]_CITE."
"This fact makes IEEE 802.15.5 standard and its ASES mechanism advantageous with respect to other WMSN approaches [2]_CITE, such as Zigbee Pro [3]_CITE, the International Engineering Task Force (IETF) with its solution IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) [4]_CITE, WirelessHART [5]_CITE or ISA SP100.11a [6]_CITE."
"Therefore, as a first contribution of this research work, we introduce a multi-objective (MO) optimization problem [7]_CITE, which allows us to formulate multiple objectives in a single problem definition, in order to later apply the mathematical tool denoted as Goal Programming (GP) [8,9]_CITE to simultaneously satisfy the objectives pursued"
"In order to obtain the best performance of the WMSN, we numerically estimated the goals for the aggregate message collision time and network lifetime metrics which are consistent with the operation of some real scenarios related to agriculture applications where our group has wide experience [10,11]_CITE"
"To this end, we first take into consideration the studies in [12 14]_CITE, which allow us to learn about the strong points and limitations of the different techniques that cope with the HT effects in WSNs and WMSNs"
"Among them, we propose a solution which follows some of the rules related to channel multiplexing [15]_CITE and time-slot scheduling [16,17]_CITE techniques, and does not require additional and costly hardware, as it is the case of proposals that employ CDMA-based or directional antenna methodologies"
"The MULTI-HIT scheme is also evaluated by means of computer simulation, comparing its performance results with the ones obtained by (i) the optimization study and (ii) a recent approach denoted as Quorum-based energy-efficient Medium Access Control protocol (Queen-MAC) [12]_CITE"
"Among them, we highlight those relevant surveys [15 20]_CITE which overview the current state of the art regarding technological solutions that offer some hints to alleviate this issue"
"Firstly, those remarkable analytical works that characterize and evaluate the HT phenomenon, in order to later quantify it with the aim of understanding its importance [21 23]_CITE"
"Secondly, up-to-date studies that provide solutions to mitigate the HT problem [12,13]_CITE, employing the same design principles proposed by our work, that is, the group comprising multi-channel [15]_CITE and time-slot scheduling [16,17]_CITE techniques."
"In particular, results in [21]_CITE demonstrate that network performance is significantly degraded by the HT phenomenon"
"Following with the IEEE 802.15.4 non-beacon mode, the research accomplished by Samaras et al [22]_CITE presents an analytical study which evaluates, in terms of throughput and latency, the performance of a network in presence of hidden terminals"
"Each node is modeled by means of an M/G/1 queue and, as in [21]_CITE, the traffic generation pattern follows a Poisson distribution under different traffic loads"
"Samaras et al validated their proposal by means of extensive ns-2 simulations and demonstrated its accuracy comparing the results obtained with analytical solutions published in the scientific literature [25,26]_CITE"
"To finish with the related analytical studies, the work in [23]_CITE measures quantitatively the effect of hidden nodes in a WSN for several scenarios (single-hop, grid, random)"
"This fact is accomplished by analyzing a straightforward mathematical model satisfying, among others, the next two assertions: (i) each node is characterized by an M/M/1/K queue, and (ii) the traffic rates follow the same criteria as those defined by studies [21,22]_CITE"
"As regards solutions that alleviate the hidden terminal phenomenon, we highlight the recent studies in [12,13]_CITE"
"In addition, the Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) mechanism, commonly used in IEEE 802.11-based networks [27]_CITE, is also employed right before exchanging data/acknowledgment ( ack) messages"
"Translated to the WSN and WMSN fields, these signaling messages imply more energy consumption in nodes and extra control overhead [28,29]_CITE"
"Furthermore, as stated in [29]_CITE, the RTS/CTS mechanism does not resolve completely the HT problems in multi-hop networks"
"Therefore, Queen-MAC cannot be employed in those applications where broadcast transmissions [30]_CITE and/or multicast transmissions [31]_CITE are accomplished by any arbitrary network node."
"This technique is also employed in other multi-channel proposals such as the ones in [32,33]_CITE, and it has been adopted in our design as well"
Collisions due to hidden terminals can be classified into two groups [35]_CITE: primary and secondary collisions
"Second, physical-space constraints (eg, obstacles such as walls, and pillars) [38,39]_CITE impose strict restrictions in the application management, such as the impossibility of using relay/sink mobility to improve the network performance"
"For example, in precision agriculture, soil moisture measurements are usually scheduled to be transmitted at periodic intervals ranging from few minutes to several hours [10]_CITE"
"In this regard, it is worth remarking that this same consideration is adopted in the work of Cano et al [23]_CITE with identical objective: to eliminate the influence of interference sources other than hidden terminals in order to obtain an appropriate quantification of the HT impact."
"In addition, we consider that nodes access the physical medium by making use of the unslotted CSMA-CA mechanism as defined by the IEEE 802.15.5 standard [41]_CITE"
"This time is fixed to 8 symbol periods according to the standard IEEE 802.15.4 in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, that is, 128 [24]_CITE"
"In our study, tturnaround takes 12 symbol periods, ie, 192 [24]_CITE"
"The idea behind distinguishing GP from other more conventional methods of optimization ( ie, single-objective, sequential-objectives or other MO techniques [42 45]_CITE) is to introduce flexibility into the objective functions (as opposed to the rigid constraints of the conventional techniques)"
Most of the traditional approaches to real-world decision problems rely on models that usually presume the optimization of objectives subject to a set of rigid constraints [46 48]_CITE
"This explains why GP is the selected multi-objective decision making tool in a large number of scientific disciplines [9]_CITE, among them, the WSNs field [11]_CITE."
"Regarding the power-consumption evaluation, we have opted for the energy model of TelosB devices [49]_CITE"
"To face this concern, we take inspiration from the multi-channel protocols which have been extensively studied in the scientific literature [14,15]_CITE, designing a solution that consists of switching dynamically among different frequency channels (technique known as channel hopping)"
"This assures a better exploitation of the total bandwidth available and provides robustness against interference from other wireless networks/technologies operating nearby ( ie, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or other WSNs/WMSNs) [14,15]_CITE"
"To achieve this purpose, we start from reference works [32,33]_CITE in order to design a pseudorandom algorithm which guarantees an efficient and straightforward multi-channel switching mechanism as well as the appropriate coordination between any sender receiver pair, requiring in turn minimal computing resources on WMSN nodes"
"The consequence is the increase in the clock drift among nodes over time ( eg, TelosB devices introduce, on average, a clock drift of 30 per second [50]_CITE), leading to transmission errors ( eg, a message is received in a slot different from the one expected)"
"To accomplish this assignment, we take benefit from the mesh network formation phase defined by the IEEE 802.15.5 standard, where nodes share their routing tables with one-hop neighbors to generate local links with them [41]_CITE"
"Then, when a one-hop neighbor receives this message, it updates its routing table, and checks the position in which its network address appears in the list included in the message [35]_CITE"
"Therefore, the following aspects must be considered in the design of the reception schedule: (i) all nodes configure the same duration for the WI, which in turn, is in accordance with the operation of ASES mode [41]_CITE; (ii) the AS and AD lengths must be equal; (iii) all nodes select the same AD value in order to maintain the same AS duration; (iv) the value of the AO parameter must be less than the WO parameter (AO<WO) to assure the existence of an ID; and (v) the number of ASs, NAS, in a single WI, must be equal to or greater than the value given by Eq (31): (31)NASi=| j NbiNbi Nbj|+2, (i,j) NT where Nbi is the set of one-hop neighbors addresses of the node i; j designs the address of each one-hop neighbor included in Nbi; Nbj is the group formed by one-hop neighbors addresses of node j; and NT is the set of all network nodes"
"Furthermore, node 5 knows the sets Nbj,j Nb5(Nb2{1,3,5},Nb4{1,5,7},Nb6{3,5,9},Nb8{5,7,9}), since, as already mentioned, the routing tables are exchanged among one-hop neighbors at the mesh network generation phase as defined by the IEEE 802.15.5 standard [2,34]_CITE"
"In particular, the routing protocol proposed in [53]_CITE satisfies our design assumption regarding that each network node selects its nearest neighbor toward the destination/sink to forward data (Assumption (iii))"
"Regarding MULTI-HIT, it can employ up to the 16 frequency channels available in the 2.4 GHz ISM band (this feature is supported by current radio transceivers, as the CC2420 [54]_CITE included in TelosB devices) to perform its multichannel functionality"
"As the synchronization issue concerns, MULTI-HIT assumes that nodes have a clock drift of 30 per second [50]_CITE, and the guard time duration is configured to 1 ms, which is an appropriate value to keep the synchronization accuracy [40]_CITE"
"To this respect, the Queen-MAC duty cycle consists of a slotted structure composed of n slots of 100 ms each [12]_CITE"
"Queen-MAC does not fully solve the HT problems, mainly due to the small number of frequency channels devoted to the multichannel procedure (fixed to 4 channels in accordance with [12]_CITE) and the inefficient employment of the RTS/CTS handshaking mechanism"
"On the one hand, nodes would periodically collect information referred to, for instance, the Receiver Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and/or the Link Quality Indicator (LQI), and using strategies such as machine-learning techniques [55]_CITE, each node would be able to determine whether a given channel is reliable enough to conduct the communications"
"Parallel graph computation is, however, challenging [1]_CITE and before the advent of cloud computing and Hadoop, programmers had to use ill-suited distributed systems or design their own systems, which required additional effort to provide fault-tolerance and to address other problems related to parallel processing [2]_CITE"
"It has been used in various areas, including some graph processing problems [3]_CITE."
"There has been a lot of research in creating design patterns improving MapReduce performance for graphs like [4,5]_CITE, or building systems that would aid iterative processing on MapReduce [6 10]_CITE"
Google reacted to that with the development of Pregel [2]_CITE an alternative system that implements the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) programming model [11]_CITE for graph processing.
The initial version of the paper was presented at the ICDM 2012 conference [12]_CITE.
"Recently, it was adapted by Google to graph processing in clouds in the Pregel system [2]_CITE"
"Pregel idea of using BSP for graph processing in clouds inspired others to create similar systems, some of which are open source eg [15,16]_CITE."
"The overview of large-scale graph engines is presented in [17]_CITE, which contains graph systems designed to achieve different goals from offline analytics system to online low-latency systems."
An empirical comparison of different paradigms for large-scale graph processing is presented in [18]_CITE
An example of partitioned global address space implementation is UPC [22]_CITE.
"MapReduce is a parallel programming model especially dedicated for complex and distributed computations, which has been derived from the functional paradigm [13]_CITE"
"To address the problem of MapReduce inefficiency for iterative graph processing, Google has created another a distributed, fault-tolerant system called Pregel [2]_CITE, which is based on the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) processing model [11]_CITE"
"Although Pregel is a proprietary system, it has inspired the creation of several open-source systems which implement the BSP model, such as Apache Hama [16]_CITE or Apache Giraph [15]_CITE."
"Although such techniques are claimed to be implemented in Pregel [2]_CITE, to our best knowledge, they are not yet supported in its open source followers"
"For that reason, the effects of graph partitioning were studied for both the MapReduce model [24,4,9]_CITE and for the BSP model [25,26]_CITE"
"To solve this problem, the Schimmy design pattern was proposed by Lin et al [4]_CITE"
The idea of joining both static and dynamic graph data in the map phase has already been proposed in the iMapReduce system [8]_CITE
Implementations of the algorithm have been studied and proposed both for MapReduce [5]_CITE and for BSP [2]_CITE.
The method was originally derived from the enhanced hypertext categorization [27]_CITE.
The YouTube dataset [30]_CITE was crawled using the YouTubeAPI in 2008
"In practice, regeneration is typically quite efficient, often producing the nonsingular isolated solutions of a polynomial system much faster than standard homotopy methods, in part by automatically taking advantage of any symmetries or structure in f(z) (see Section 9.3 of [9]_CITE)"
"Their solution is rooted in deflation [21,22,15,14]_CITE"
"In Section 5, we describe the connection of this perturbation approach to the deflation approach of [9]_CITE, the method of regenerative cascade [10]_CITE, and a very early technique in the field known as the cheater homotopy [17]_CITE in which the authors made use of a perturbation of f (z) for somewhat different reasons"
"It is observed in [17,24]_CITE that a perturbation can cause positive-dimensional irreducible components to break into a (possibly very large) number of isolated solutions"
This and other optimizations of regeneration are described in [9]_CITE
The rank of f(z) is an upper bound on the codimension of the irreducible components of V(f) [24]_CITE
It should be noted that this theorem is in fact a corollary to the main result in [17]_CITE
Regeneration can compute all of these nonsingular solutions [9]_CITE
Generalizations of all three lemmas appear in Appendix A of [24]_CITE as consequences of an algebraic version of Sard Theorem
"A more general statement than Lemma 3.3 is given as an exercise in [7]_CITE and a related result for a pure d-dimensional algebraic subset is presented in [8]_CITE, for d>0"
"First, we may trivially compute the multiplicity, (zi), of each isolated solution zi of f(z)=0, as defined in [24]_CITE: Corollary 3.6Algorithm 1 produces not only the isolated solutions of f(z)=0 but also the multiplicity (zi) of each solution zi"
"In the article [20]_CITE, Morrison and Swinarski study a polynomial system with 13 equations, having 51 isolated solutions"
"Computing the numerical irreducible decomposition [3,24]_CITE, the solution set consists of 10 irreducible components of various dimensions, provided in Table 4"
"As outlined in [9]_CITE, regeneration techniques can be combined with deflation to find singular solutions"
"Deflation for polynomial systems, including a proof that the method will ultimately yield a nonsingular solution, was further considered in [15,14]_CITE"
The regenerative cascade of [10]_CITE provides an equation-by-equation approach to computing the numerical irreducible decomposition of the solution set of a polynomial system
This idea has been implemented in Bertini [2]_CITE and Paramotopy [4]_CITE
"Some background may be found in [19,17]_CITE"
The cheaters homotopy in [17]_CITE addresses this issue by including the same perturbation parameter as in Lemma 3.2
"As described in [18]_CITE, if f:CN Cn has rank n,N n, and the dimension of the solution set of f(z)-p is N-n for generic p Cn, then such a perturbation will lead to at least one point per connected (complex) component"
"If the user expects positive-dimensional solution sets (or cannot preclude their presence), regenerative cascade [10]_CITE is typically the best bet"
"This despite the fact that they are more difficult to implement in larger projects ( Dyb _and_Dings yr,_2009_CITE)"
"Despite these known problems related to large-scale agile, there is an industry trend towards adopting agile methodologies in-the-large ( VersionOne,_Inc,_2016;_Paasivaara_et al.,_2013,_2014;_Dings yr_and_Moe,_2014_CITE)."
"According to the latest survey ( VersionOne,_Inc,_2016_CITE), 62% of the almost 4000 respondents had more than a hundred people in their software organization and 43% of all the respondents worked in development organizations where more than half of the teams were agile"
"However, this indicates that there seems to exist a large number of companies that have taken or are taking agile into use in large-scale settings ( VersionOne,_Inc,_2016_CITE)."
Freudenberg_and_Sharp_(2010)_CITE asked the industrial practitioners at the XP2010 conference to create a backlog of topics they think should be studied
"In two recent workshops on large-scale agile development organized in XP2013 and XP2014 conferences, adoption of agile methods was one of the highlighted themes needing more research ( Dings yr_and_Moe,_2013,_2014_CITE)."
"Agile software development is a set of iterative and incremental software engineering methods that are advocated based on an agile philosophy captured in the Agile Manifesto ( Fowler_and_Highsmith,_2001_CITE)"
"Traditional methods focus on up-front planning and strict management of change, but agile methods were designed to accept and efficiently manage change ( Highsmith_and_Cockburn,_2001;_Cockburn_and_Highsmith,_2001_CITE)."
"Agile methods have been both criticized and advocated, and research has shown that accommodating change may be a factor in both success and failure ( Boehm,_2002_CITE)"
"It has been shown that agile methods have improved satisfaction of both customers and developers, but on the other hand there is evidence that agile methods may not be a good fit for large undertakings ( Dyb _and_Dings yr,_2009_CITE)"
"A proposed solution is that each organization seeks its own balance of agile and plan driven methods ( Boehm,_2002_CITE)."
"Scrum is a method focusing on the project management viewpoint of agile development ( Schwaber_and_Beedle,_2002_CITE), prescribing timeboxing, continuous tracking of project progress, and customer centricity"
"The XP development method is a collection of practices for enabling efficient incremental development ( Beck,_1999_CITE)"
"In practice, many agile development implementations combine the two in some way ( Fitzgerald_et al.,_2006_CITE)."
"The difficulty of introducing agile methods increases with the organization size ( Dyb _and_Dings yr,_2008_CITE)"
"The difficulty is partly related to size bringing higher organizational inertia which slows down organizational change ( Livermore,_2008_CITE)"
"Adopting agile often requires change of the entire organizational culture ( Misra_et al.,_2010_CITE)."
"This increases the need for formal documentation and thus reduces agility ( Lindvall_et al.,_2004_CITE)"
"For instance, human resources unit may demand individuals to have strictly specified roles in projects ( Boehm_and_Turner,_2005_CITE), or a change control board may inhibit the use of continuous integration or refactoring ( Lindvall_et al.,_2004_CITE)"
"All units affected by the agile transformation need to be informed and consulted, and the agile process must be adjusted according to their needs ( Lindvall_et al.,_2004;_Cohn_and_Ford,_2003;_Boehm_and_Turner,_2005_CITE)."
"A key challenge is that management must move away from life-cycle models and towards iterative and feature centric models ( Nerur_et al.,_2005_CITE), which requires a change of mindset"
"The focus must be shifted from long-term planning to shorter term project planning ( Misra_et al.,_2010_CITE), as agile methods emphasize that planning is only meaningful for the near future ( Cohn_and_Ford,_2003_CITE)"
"Enabling operation with shorter term planning requires educating stakeholders and reviewing contracting practices ( Boehm_and_Turner,_2005_CITE)."
"A brief literature search ( Dings yr_et al.,_2014_CITE) identified previous interpretations of what large-scale agile is"
"The examples of cases that were called large-scale included 40 people and 7 teams ( Paasivaara_et al.,_2008_CITE), project cost of over 10 million GBP and a team size of over 50 people ( Berger_and_Beynon-Davies,_2009_CITE), a code base size of over 5 million lines of code ( Petersen_and_Wohlin,_2010_CITE), and a project time of 2 years with a project scope of 60 80 features ( Bjarnason_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
Based on their findings Dings yr_et al._(2014)_CITE ended up measuring large-scale by the number of collaborating and coordinating teams: they categorized as large-scale 2-9 collaborating teams and as very large-scale over ten collaborating teams.
"In early work on agile, Fowler considers the Crystal methodology to be suitable for up to 50 people ( Fowler,_2000_CITE)"
"The same number has been reported as seen by practitioners and researchers as the size of the largest organization suitable for agile ( Williams_and_Cockburn,_2003_CITE)"
"Other studies have referred to agile projects including up to 50 people as small ( Koehnemann_and_Coats,_2009_CITE), and considered a development project large if it had a staff between 50 and 100 people, including all project personnel ( Elshamy_and_Elssamadisy,_2006_CITE)"
"The largest numbers were 300 people across 3 sites ( Moore_and_Spens,_2008_CITE)"
"Participants of the XP2014 large-scale agile workshop gave very varying definitions for large-scale agile development ( Dings yr_and_Moe,_2014_CITE), showing that what is seen as large-scale depends very much on the context and the person defining it."
"They are appropriate for summarizing existing research, for identifying gaps in the existing literature, as well as for providing background for positioning new research ( Kitchenham,_2007_CITE)."
"In addition, we required that the organizational transformation was aimed at introducing agile methods, which excluded other development methods ( Sagesser_et al.,_2013_CITE), and the use of agile methods in other contexts than software development ( Hodgkins_and_Hohmann,_2007_CITE)."
"Examples of excluded topics include comparing the original and agile development methods ( Petersen_and_Wohlin,_2010_CITE), discussing the use of agile in a large enough organization but not describing how the new methods were introduced ( Mishra_and_Mishra,_2011_CITE), and merely presenting agile tools in large-scale use ( Kim_and_Ryoo,_2012_CITE)."
"However, we excluded cases where an initially small agile organization grew organically ( Maranzato_et al.,_2012_CITE), and discussions focusing on processes or tools without describing organizational change ( Lyon_and_Evans,_2008_CITE)."
"For example, one paper would highlight the viewpoint of the developers ( Fry_and_Greene,_2007_CITE), and another would consider the transformation from the user experience designers point of view ( Federoff_and_Courage,_2009_CITE)."
"We coded the primary studies using an integrated deductive and inductive approach, coding both a contextual and a findings part ( Cruzes_and_Dyba,_2011_CITE)"
"The studies and surveys that do exist have studied agile in general, not specifically as large-scale nor agile transformations, eg Chow_and_Cao_(2008)_CITE studied success factors in agile software projects in general"
"The closest to our study is the State of Agile survey, as large part of the respondents of their latest survey ( VersionOne,_Inc,_2016_CITE) were from large organizations that had at least partially adopted agile"
"For example, agile consultants have put together an Agile Scaling Knowledgebase Decision Matrix ( Mat,_2016_CITE), where they briefly compare different agile scaling approaches in one big excel sheet"
"Surveys on challenges and success factors for agile projects in general have been conducted, eg( Chow_and_Cao,_2008_CITE)"
"The problem of computing how (dis)similar two trees are, and the related problem of computing a consensus between a set of trees, has applications in computational biology, chemistry, music genre analysis, and automatic theorem-proving [14,18,23,25]_CITE"
"For example, calculating the distance between RNA secondary structures (which have a tree structure) is necessary to understand their comparative functionality [26]_CITE"
"For example, for rooted, unordered, fully-labelled trees (trees with a root, in which every vertex is labelled and the left-to-right order of siblings carries no significance, such as taxonomies and other hierarchies), a recent survey [5]_CITE discusses three distances that are all NP-hard"
"The task of defining and computing distances between trees can be considered a special case of the graph comparison problem, which has an extensive literature: see Gao et al [13]_CITE for a summary"
"When the graphs are directed and contain no cycles, the graph becomes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) some authors have studied the distances between DAGs [6,16]_CITE"
The case for unordered trees is known to be NP-hard [5]_CITE
Restrictions were also introduced such as the top-down distance [21]_CITE which only allowed insertions to occur at leaves
"As with the tree edit distance for unordered trees, computing either the tree alignment distance or the tree inclusion problem is MAX SNP-hard [5]_CITE."
"Shasha et al [22]_CITE claims there are five commonly-used methods for achieving this, which we review here"
"Margush and McMorris [17]_CITE pointed out that in the case that many of the trees in a large set are identical (say, equal to T) and one differs from T by a single edge, that the consensus should be equal to T"
"The semi-strict consensus tree for leaf-labelled trees [7]_CITE includes all subtrees by Adams method, but also any subtrees which are not contradicted by other members of the group"
"Finally, the Nelson consensus [20]_CITE consists of the set of mutually compatible subtrees that are most frequently replicated in the group."
"Note that |TV,R|=nn 2 with n=|V| (Caley number, [15]_CITE)"
"Clearly, PTc PT PT , and when the Hasse diagram [3]_CITE of PT PT is a tree, the optimal PTc=PT PT"
"Above-diagonal entries are also close to 0.0, indicating that there is little similarity between industrially-used music genre hierarchies something speculated about in previous work [2]_CITE but never quantified"
"A further idea for future research is the investigation of information cascades [12]_CITE, where trees are formed by information flowing through a network"
"The traditional methods for estimating PDFs, eg binning methods and kernel density techniques, require specification of a bandwidth parameter that heavily influences the shape of the resulting PDF ( Silverman,_1986;_Wilks,_2006;_Srihera_and_Stute,_2011_CITE)"
"While methods exist for estimating an optimal bandwidth, these methods usually require some assumption about the shape of the underlying PDF ( Wand_and_Jones,_1995;_Srihera_and_Stute,_2011;_Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti,_2011_CITE)"
"While methods do exist for testing normality (eg, Murota_and_Takeuchi,_1981_CITE), our analysis additionally requires that we estimate various moments of the distribution"
"For these reasons, the method of Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE for estimating PDF distributions should in principle be well suited for such an application because it provides an objective PDF estimate that requires no prior assumptions regarding the underlying distribution"
"Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE derive an expression for a data-derived, optimal kernel ( Watson_and_Leadbetter,_1963_CITE) and the resulting and self-consistent kernel density estimate; their kernel derivation method is even optimal for multi-modal data"
"Except in some specific circumstances (eg, the data are known to be normally distributed ( Silverman,_1986_CITE)), the choice of the kernel and the kernel width are subjective ( Liao_et al.,_2010;_Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti,_2011;_Srihera_and_Stute,_2011_CITE)"
Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE recently derived a method for objectively estimating the probability distribution function (PDF) of a univariate dataset
"Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE use this relationship and the result of Watson_and_Leadbetter_(1963)_CITE, which states that the mean squared error of a kernel density estimate is minimized if the kernel satisfies the equation: =N"
"Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE show that sc converges to the true underlying distribution as N increases, provided that a number of conditions are met, including the integrability of the characteristic function and boundedness of A"
"However, the nonuniform FFT (nuFFT) method described by Greengard_and_Lee_(2004)_CITE is specifically designed to reduce the computational cost of DFTs on irregularly-spaced data"
"Greengard_and_Lee_(2004)_CITE show that the nuFFT can approximate the DFT with arbitrary accuracy, which is controlled by the interaction of three main factors: the width h of the convolving Gaussian; the number surrounding k values at which the convolution is calculated for each ( j,aj) point; and the spacing of the k grid"
"We only consider the lowest half of the frequency points (ie, we set Cn=0 for n>1025) since the nonuniform FFT method is only guaranteed to provide a good approximation over this range ( Dutt_and_Rokhlin,_1993_CITE)"
"Following Dutt_and_Rokhlin_(1993)_CITE, we specify the width of the convolution kernel as h=1.5629, and we apply the convolution to the q=28 k nearest points surrounding each j data value"
"We also note that we implemented the selective frequency filter, In, in a slightly different manner than Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE"
Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE note that the selection of the subset of frequencies is arbitrary and corresponds to the arbitrary choice of initial density estimate in the iterative procedure that they use to derive the expression for
"Because atmospheric velocities are known to exhibit statistical self-similarity in reality and in models ( Nastrom_and_Gage,_1985;_Skamarock,_2004;_Rauscher_et al.,_2013_CITE), we apply the analysis to a realization of a fractional Brownian motion, which is a type of self-similar field ( Mandelbrot,_1983_CITE)"
"fBm fields are characterized by their Hurst parameter H ( Mandelbrot,_1983_CITE), which is directly related to for fBm fields by the relationship H=( 1)/2 ( Davis_et al.,_1994_CITE)"
"Davis_et al._(1994)_CITE define the mth-order structure function of a field F as SmF( x) |F(x) F(x+ x)|m , which is the mth (absolute) moment of the PDF of increments calculated at distance x (we define as the average)"
"Since the fBm field is generated based on samples drawn from a normal distribution, it can be shown that the distribution of increments is also normally distributed ( Davis_et al.,_1996_CITE)"
"We use a version of CAM4 that includes the Model for Prediction Across Scales atmospheric (MPAS-A) dynamical core, which predicts the evolution of the atmosphere by evaluating conservation laws (eg, conservation of mass, momentum, etc.) on a centroidal Voronoi tessellation of the sphere ( Rauscher_et al.,_2013;_Skamarock_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"Initial evaluation of CAM4 with the MPAS-A dynamical core showed that the model exhibits some distinctly resolution-dependent artifacts ( Rauscher_et al.,_2013;_O Brien_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"Subsequent analysis has shown that this resolution-dependence may be linked to resolution dependence of the vertical velocity field ( Yang_et al.,_2014_CITE), and we have recently developed a theory linking the resolution dependence of the vertical velocity field to the self-similarity of the horizontal velocity field"
"For the lower bound, it is well known that the diffusive properties of atmospheric models tend to dampen variability for length scales ranging from one grid cell to ten grid cells ( Skamarock,_2004_CITE)"
"This divergence is characteristic of a multifractal field ( Davis_et al.,_1994_CITE), and it indicates that the zonal velocity increments are not distributed normally"
"It shows that the (modeled) atmosphere is not well-characterized by a single scaling exponent, as suggested by Nastrom_and_Gage_(1985)_CITE, but that the fractal behavior of the atmosphere ranges from anti-persistent ( H1<0.5) to persistent ( H1>0.5) depending on location"
"While we could have used other methods of density estimation, such as binning or traditional kernel density estimation, the Bernacchia_and_Pigolotti_(2011)_CITE method avoids the complication of having to choose either bin width or kernel bandwidth, which is a subjective choice when faced with data from an unknown distribution"
"As far as we are aware, no authors have explored the use of nonuniform FFT methods for calculating empirical characteristic functions (ECFs) in general, even though empirical characteristic functions have a wide variety of uses, including: testing for distribution symmetry ( Feuerverger_and_Mureika,_1977_CITE), testing for data independence ( Cs rg ,_1985;_Bilodeau_and_Lafaye_de_Micheaux,_2005_CITE), testing whether data belong to a given distribution family ( Murota_and_Takeuchi,_1981;_Baringhaus_and_Henze,_1988_CITE), testing whether two sets of data belong to the same family ( Alba_Fern ndez_et al.,_2008_CITE), and model fitting ( Fan,_1997;_Knight_and_Yu,_2002;_Jim nez-Gamero_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"However, the nonuniform FFT method is also applicable to multidimensional transforms ( Greengard_and_Lee,_2004_CITE), and so the idea developed in this manuscript could easily be extended to multidimensional data"
"For example, a multidimensional BP11 estimate of the joint velocity, humidity, and enthalpy PDF could provide a non-parametric method for estimating subgrid fluxes that is complementary to existing parametric methods (ie, Golaz_et al.,_2002_CITE), which are known to depend on the shape of the assumed PDF ( Bogenschutz_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Breast cancer remains one of the leading forms of cancer, with studies indicating that 1.38 million women were diagnosed with the disease in 2008, accounting for nearly a quarter of all cancer cases worldwide [11]_CITE"
One of the most reliable and effective methods for detecting early stage cancer is mammographic screening [33]_CITE
Regular screening of women over the age of 50 has proved effective at detecting changes in the breast parenchyma that could lead to the development of cancer [13]_CITE.
"Microcalcifications, as shown in Fig_1 , are small deposits of calcium in breast tissue that appear as small bright spots in mammograms [29,19]_CITE"
"The radiological definition of a microcalcification cluster is an area of 1 cm 2 that contains more than 5 microcalcifications [25,9]_CITE"
"Only certain kinds of microcalcification cluster are associated with a high probability of malignancy [30,9]_CITE, whilst the rest are considered as benign"
"For clinicians, it is a time consuming and difficult task to identify and classify malignant or benign microcalcifications resulting in a high rate of unnecessary biopsies [7]_CITE"
"To improve diagnostic accuracy, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been applied to reduce the false positive rate whilst maintaining sensitivity [7,22]_CITE."
Various automatic approaches have been suggested to help classify microcalcifications into either benign or malignant [10]_CITE
"These methods use such features as shape, morphology, cluster based features, and intensity or texture [7,10]_CITE"
"Many of these methods will examine the shape and morphology of individual calcifications [29,19]_CITE"
"In [28]_CITE, features are extracted from the microcalcification clusters before a neural network or support vector machine classifier is used to classify the clusters into either benign or malignant"
Chen et al [6]_CITE present a multi-scale topological approach to microcalcification cluster classification by building a multi-scale graph of the inter-microcalcification relationships
In this paper a multi-scale topological approach to microcalcification modelling and classification is presented based on extending the area of discrete mereotopology [12]_CITE to incorporate persistence
"Although topological modelling of microcalcification clusters is not new [6]_CITE, no investigation has been made into the use of mereotopology for microcalcification classification"
Discrete mereotopology (DM) [12]_CITE is a discrete version of classic Region Connection Calculus (RCC) [26]_CITE that can also be expressed in terms of mathematical morphology [27]_CITE
"Throughout this paper, the notation is the same as that of Landini et al [18]_CITE where lower-case letters denote pixels, upper-case letters denote regions, functions are strings of lower-case letters, and predicates are strings of upper-case or lower-case letters prefixed with upper-case letters"
The one-to-one mapping between atoms and pixels is guaranteed via the following axiom given by [27]_CITE (2) x X y(y X y=x)
The RCC8D relationships define a set of true mereotopological relations through the introduction of the topological notion of connectivity [27]_CITE
"The RCC8D relationships can be cast in DM terms using the following topological notion of connection: (3)C(X,Y) def xy(x X y Y A(x,y))where A is the adjacency relation that determines which pixels are accessible from a given pixel [27]_CITE"
The eight relationships form a jointly exhaustive pairwise disjoint set which is a discrete analogue of RCC8 [27]_CITE.
"As shown by Randell et al [27]_CITE and Bloch [4]_CITE, the RCC8D relationships described above can be implemented using mathematical morphology [31]_CITE"
"To do so, the dilation operator, with a 3 3 structuring element B, is used [18]_CITE"
"These two definitions are closely related to the clinical definitions of benign and malignant microcalcification clusters [3]_CITE, whereby a benign microcalcification cluster will be generally spread over a larger area whereas a malignant cluster is more likely to be tightly packed."
"The formulation of a mereotopological barcode, an example of which is shown in Fig_2, is based firmly in existing work from the field of persistent topology [5,8,34]_CITE"
"Following the definitions given by Carlsson et al [5]_CITE, let I denote the collection of all possible barcodes"
The key insight made by Carlsson et al [5]_CITE and Collins et al [8]_CITE with respect to the barcode metric space is that the distance between two barcodes can be formulated as a matching problem
"Given that, for a pair of intervals (I,J), it is known that (I,J)= (I)+ (J)-2 (I J), Carlsson et al [5]_CITE showed that the similarity of two barcodes S1 and S2 can be defined as (10)SM(S1,S2)= (I,J) M (I J) (11)=12 S1 (I)+ S2 (J)-DM(I,J)"
"As stated by Carlsson et al [5]_CITE, with this graph in place, maximising SM is the same as the maximum weight bipartite matching problem, the solution to which can be found by utilising the Hungarian algorithm [17]_CITE."
1 database [15]_CITE and contains 300 image patches with varying dimensions
The microcalcification patches from this dataset were detected using the approach developed by Oliver et al [21]_CITE
"The first two folds were used for training and test to find the best performing values of k and s, with performance being assessed based on the area under the ROC curve [2]_CITE"
"The overall classification accuracies (CA) are recorded for each dataset as well as the area under the ROC curve (AUC), denoted Az [2]_CITE"
"It is a statistically consistent measure which is equivalent to the Wilcoxon signed ranks test [16,20]_CITE"
"The standard error is defined by Hanley and McNeil [14]_CITE as (12)SE=Az(1-Az)+(nm-1)(Q1-Az2)+(nb-1)(Q2-Az2)nmnbwhere nm and nb are the number of malignant and benign cases respectively, and Q1=Az/(2-Az) and Q2=2Az2/(1+Az)."
"In Table 3 the results of the proposed method are compared to those of four existing algorithms for microcalcification cluster classification [6,19,28]_CITE"
Ma et al [19]_CITE is a simple thresholding approach that assigns a microcalcification cluster as malignant if the corresponding feature of a selected microcalcification is above a certain threshold
"The method of Ren [28]_CITE extracts multiple features, both intensity and shape related, from each microcalcification and uses a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to achieve the final benign or malignant classification"
Chen et al [6]_CITE uses a multi-scale topological approach extracted from a neighbourhood graph of the microcalcifications over multiple scales
This is only slightly worse than the leading approach of Chen et al [6]_CITE where a classification accuracy of CA=95% is achieved with Az=0.96
"First, as noted by Oliver et al [21]_CITE, the detection results for the DDSM dataset produce lower probability scores than other datasets meaning that the detection algorithm has a lower accuracy on the DDSM dataset"
"Simplistically, benign microcalcifications will usually be larger than those associated with malignancy [1]_CITE; as well as this, malignant clusters will tend to be tightly clustered within a smaller area whilst benign clusters are more spread out [3]_CITE"
The justification for this becomes apparent when considering the fact that benign calcifications have a tendency to be spread over a larger area with larger microcalcifications [3]_CITE
"Future work will extend the classification of malignant microcalcifications into intracystic/microcystic calcifications, which layer into tea cup shapes on later mammograms, and rounded well circumscribed calcifications which exhibit the typical paw print distribution [23]_CITE."
"From a clinical perspective, future work will investigate how mereotopological barcodes can model different distribution modifiers [1]_CITE and so provide a richer classification of microcalcification clusters."
"Then we can take advantage of the well-developed theory and algorithms of the latter, see [2,4,5,8,14,24,25]_CITE, to mention only a few possible sources"
Recall that the basic theory of one-sided systems A x=b involves residuation theory [15]_CITE as well as set coverings [5]_CITE
"A basic idea behind this paper is that each fuzzy triangular norm (t-norm) as described, for instance, in Klement, Mesiar and Pap [31]_CITE, leads to an idempotent semiring, which we call a max-t semiring"
Some connections of multivalued logic and fuzzy algebra with idempotent mathematics have been developed by Di Nola et al [18 21]_CITE
"However, neither general MV-algebras [19]_CITE nor even the special case of ukasiewicz MV-algebra are considered in this paper"
"We also remark that max- ukasiewicz semiring can be seen as a special case of incline algebras of Cao, Kim and Roush [9]_CITE, see also, eg, Han Li [28]_CITE and Tan [40]_CITE"
"Powers of matrices over distributive lattices are studied, eg, by Cechl rov [11]_CITE."
"Let us also recall the basic network motivation to study tropical (max-plus) linear algebra and, more generally, linear algebra over semirings (Gondran Minoux [26]_CITE, see also Litvinov Maslov [34]_CITE)"
"This CSR form of the Cyclicity Theorem [12]_CITE was obtained in [37]_CITE, see also [39]_CITE."
"The tropical spectral theory can be further applied to the equation (12)x=Ax b, which has been studied, eg, in [4,10,34]_CITE"
"It is called Bellman equation due to its relations with dynamic optimization on graphs and in particular, the Bellman optimality principle [34]_CITE"
"Its nonnegative analogue is known as Z-matrix equation, see [8]_CITE."
"Problem (51) is an instance of the tropical linear programming problems treated by Butkovic and Aminu [5,6]_CITE and Gaubert et al [25]_CITE"
"It can be solved in pseudopolynomial time [5,6]_CITE, by means of a psudopolynomial number of calls to a mean-payoff game oracle [25]_CITE"
"Butkovi [5]_CITE and Sergeev [38]_CITE studied the so-called attraction cones in tropical algebra, that is, sets of vectors x such that the orbit Atx hits an eigenvector of A at some t"
"This system of equations can be analysed as in [38]_CITE, a task that we postpone to a future work"
"In computer science, a datatype is usually defined as a classification that identifies various types of data, such as boolean, integer, discrete and others, that determines the possible values for that type, operations on the values of the data, and the way the values of that type can be stored [56]_CITE"
"Nell and Walker [8]_CITE discuss the difference between a data structure and datatype in the sense that data structure refers to the study of data and how to represent data objects within a program; that is, the implementation of structured relationships while a datatype defines the properties of classes of objects in addition to how these objects might be represented in a program"
"Martin [36]_CITE also discusses the difference between data structures and datatypes and states that depending on the point of view, a data object is characterized by its type (for the user) or by its structure (for the implementer) ."
The OntoDT ontology is based on the latest revised version of the ISO/IEC 11404 standard for datatypes [23]_CITE.
The OntoDT development started within the frame of an ontology for data mining (OntoDM) [44]_CITE
It is based on the International Standard ISO/IEC 11404 for representing datatypes in computer systems [23]_CITE
"For example, the research data alliance (RDA) [50]_CITE, whose major goal is to speed up the international data-driven innovation and discovery by facilitating research data sharing and exchange, has identified that the problem of data typing is an important problem that deserves attention"
"For this purpose, the RDA formed a data type registy (DTR) working group [11]_CITE with the goal to: compile a set of use cases for datatype use and management, formulate a data model and expression for datatypes (prototype registry available at [10]_CITE), design a functional specification for type registries, and propose a federation strategy among multiple type registries."
Meek [37]_CITE discussed a proposal for a taxonomy of datatypes using as a base the first version of the ISO 11404 standard [22]_CITE
"For example, a definition of the term attribute ( Defines an attribute ) is circular and does not explain how an attribute is different from eg an element [68]_CITE."
The RDF data cube vocabulary is focusing on the publication of multidimensional data on the web [51]_CITE
"The dimension property links observations to other resources, ie Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) [57]_CITE, which defines the semantics of the data"
"A better approach would be to capture the information about data pre-processing, processing and post-processing separately and then link it to the data items (observations) [45]_CITE."
Linked Models is a web resource for publishing RDF/OWL models of commonly used industry and government standards [33]_CITE
Several ontologies have been produced for sensor observation services [53]_CITE
"For example, the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (SSN) describes sensors in terms of capabilities, measurement processes, observations and deployments [6,55]_CITE"
An ontology for ecological observational data (OBOE) defines the notion of scientific observation as a unifying concept for capturing the basic semantics of ecological data [34]_CITE
Many biomedical ontologies available at BioPortal include a class named datatype [4]_CITE
"These include: the NanoParticle Ontology (NPO) [65]_CITE, the Health Level Seven Reference Implementation Model [17]_CITE, the Syndromic Surveillance Ontology [64]_CITE, the Microarray and gene expression data ontology (MO) [38]_CITE, the Phylogenetic ontology [47]_CITE, and the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus [39]_CITE"
Image and Data Quality Assessment Ontology (IDQA) [21]_CITE defines Data Type as Superclass for different type of data: data itself and images (TS)
"Finally, ontologies designed to support data mining studies, eg, the Data Mining OPtimization ontology (DMOP) [9,19,28]_CITE and Data Mining Workflow ontology (DMWF) [29]_CITE, include representation of datatypes only on a basic level"
"The design of the OntoDT ontology follows best practices in ontology engineering, such as the OBO Foundry principles, which are widely accepted in the biomedical domain [60]_CITE"
"IAO has been designed to support the representation of information entities, and it is compliant with the basic formal ontology (BFO) [3]_CITE and the OBO relational ontology (RO) [52,61]_CITE"
"There are several other upper level ontologies, ie SUMO [40,62]_CITE, DOLCE [12]_CITE, but they are focused on modeling primarily real world entities"
"The use of an upper level ontology and a set of widely accepted formally defined relations eases the interoperability of OntoDT with other external ontologies, eg, the Software Ontology [63]_CITE, where possible"
"OntoDT re-uses existing ontological resources, such as Open Biomedical Ontologies [42]_CITE"
"For example, it reuses the OBI ontology [41]_CITE, ie, the class OBI:0000658: data representational model"
Classes that are reused in OntoDT are imported following the Minimum Information to Reference an External Ontology Term (MIREOT) principle [7]_CITE
The value space of a given datatype can be defined in different ways: by enumerating the values; with axioms using a set of fundamental notions; as a subset of values defined in another value space with a given set of properties; or as a combination of arbitrary values from some other defined value space by specifying a construction procedure [23]_CITE.
OntoDT can be queried using the Description Logic (DL) [1]_CITE query plug-in available in the Prot g software
A primitive datatype is-a datatype whose value space is defined either axiomatically or by enumeration [23]_CITE
"from the UCI repository [2]_CITE, we can formally represent datatypes describing the Iris data examples by defining instances of OntoDT datatype classes."
"A datatype generator is an IAO:directive information entity, which specifies the conceptual operation on one or more datatypes which yields a datatype [23]_CITE"
A user defined datatype is a datatype that is defined by a type specification [23]_CITE
A variety of ontology metrics is available for assessing ontologies [15]_CITE
"We used statistical ontology metrics from the Prot g software [48]_CITE and the BioPortal web service [4]_CITE, such as the number of classes, the number of axioms, the number of disjoint classes, the number of equivalent classes, the number of annotation axioms, and others"
The Description Logics (DL) expressivity [1]_CITE of the ontology language defined by the ontology is ALCHOIQ(D).
"Following the methodology for the design and evaluation of ontologies proposed by Gr niger and Fox [16]_CITE, we specified a set of competency questions in the design phase"
"OntoDM-core is a domain ontology that defines the most essential data mining entities such as dataset, data mining task, generalizations, data mining algorithms, and constraints [45]_CITE"
"The OntoDT ontology has a key role in OntoDM-core [45,_see Fig_2]_CITE"
"For example, the hierarchical classification task [58]_CITE can be only applied to data having a record of primitive components on the descriptive side and a labeled graph (or tree) with boolean edges and discrete datatype nodes on the target side"
"used in predictive modeling experiments by Kocev et al [30,_see Tables 3 5]_CITE and Madjarov et al [35,_see Table 1]_CITE"
"For example, the EDM dataset [27]_CITE has 16 continuous descriptive attributes and 2 continuous target attributes"
"The OWL2Query plug-in is a conjunctive query, meta-query and a visualization engine that facilitates the creation of SPARQL queries using an intuitive graph based syntax and evaluates them by using an OWL-API compliant reasoner [31]_CITE"
Its semantic meaning can be defined via the is-about relation to the amino acid sequence entity provided by the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus [39]_CITE
"Currently, BioXSD is used to define the basic bio-informatics types of data [26]_CITE, but it inherits the limitations of XSD (see Section 2)"
We propose to enhance the representation of bioinformatics datatypes by exploiting the rigorous taxonomy of datatypes defined in OntoDT and the framework for the representation of semantic meanings adopted by OntoDT following the RDF data cube vocabulary [51]_CITE
"However, this datatype sequence is not explicitly linked to the classes nucleotide and amino-acid defined in the ChEBI ontology [5]_CITE, which is recommended by OBO Foundry as a reference ontology."
We represent the bio-sequence datatype class as a subclass of the character sequence datatype class with the defined semantic meaning in the NCI Thesaurus [39]_CITE and EDAM ontology [13]_CITE (see Fig_8a)
"In order to define their semantic meaning, we explicitly link them to the nucleotide and amino acid classes from the ChEBI ontology [5]_CITE"
"For example, OntoDT can be easily linked with ontologies of quantities and units (eg [32,49]_CITE) and also with ontologies defining operations on the data, eg OntoDM-core [45]_CITE."
BioXSD uses a combined approach of a pure XML Schema annotated by a data-type ontology using Semantic Annotations for Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and XML Schema [54]_CITE

"For visibly detectable substances, such as volcanic ash, satellite images are the preferred form of measurement data [3]_CITE; however, this approach is limited in terms of spatial and temporal resolution of the satellite and obstruction by clouds"
"The determination of source parameters from these sensor measurements is a problem in inverse modelling; the inverse problem is highly non-linear, ill-posed [4]_CITE and subject to input data that is typically sporadic, noisy and sparse [5]_CITE"
"For instance, mobile sensors have been employed to determine the spread of a range of boundaries such as oil spills [6]_CITE, forest fires [7]_CITE, ocean temperatures [8]_CITE and the growth of harmful algae bloom [9]_CITE"
"The equation of the Gaussian plume is derived from the turbulent diffusion equation by assuming homogeneous, steady state flow and a steady state point source, resulting in: (1)C(x,y,z,Q)=Qu y z2 ( y22 y2)[exp( (z h)22 z2)+exp( (z+h)22 z2)]where C is a concentration at a given position, Q is the release rate, x, y and z are the downwind, crosswind and vertical distances, and u is the mean wind speed at the height h of the release [3]_CITE"
Concentrations expected at that sensor can then be calculated for any source term by computing the inner product of the source distribution and the adjoint concentration field [21]_CITE.
"Within the literature, the adjoint source-receptor relationship has been used standalone to estimate the source term [22]_CITE, and to quantify the uncertain relationship/sensitivity between source parameters and sensor concentration readings [23]_CITE"

"Source estimation of multiple releases is a particularly complex problem which has been tackled in more recent research [23,24,31 40]_CITE"
"The type of release has varied from: (i) a steady state plume [21,23,31,37,41 51]_CITE, (ii) a dynamic plume [24,32 36,38,39,52 55]_CITE and (iii) an instantaneous release or puff [24,39,55]_CITE"

"A variety of methods have been used to optimise the objective function such as gradient-based methods [23,56]_CITE, direct search methods (eg the pattern search method [54]_CITE), and intelligent optimisation methods (eg simulated annealing [51]_CITE and the genetic algorithm [38,57 60]_CITE)"
The iterative minimisation of the cost function Eq (2) requires an initial guess of source term [61]_CITE
"Re-normalisation or regularised least squares is a strategy for linear assimilation of concentration measurements to identify the unknown releases [62,63]_CITE"
"The weight functions could be computed iteratively using an algorithm proposed by Issartel [63]_CITE; besides, a minimum norm weighted solution provides an estimate for the distributed emissions and is seen as a generalised inverse solution to the under-determined class of linear inverse problems [64]_CITE"
"Overall, the re-normalisation approach utilises the adjoint source-receptor relationship mentioned in Section 2.2 and constructs a source estimate among a vector space of acceptable sources, which describes the possible distribution of the emission sources [65]_CITE"
Sharan et al [56]_CITE used regularised least squares to determine the source term of a point release using the fact that the maximum of the source estimate will coincide with the location of the release
An advection-diffusion based dispersion model [66]_CITE was used to generate an adjoint model of the source-receptor relationship
The method was extended in [67]_CITE for identification of an elevated release with an inversion error estimate
The algorithm was further extended to identify multiple-point releases [68]_CITE where the number of releases was known

"Later in [57]_CITE, Allen et al used this method to characterise a pollutant source by estimating its two dimensional location, strength and the surface wind direction"
Including the surface wind direction as a parameter to be optimised in the GA could account for the sparse resolution of meteorological wind field data and any error therein [57]_CITE
"To further refine the final estimate of the source term, a hybrid GA was formulated in [58]_CITE"
"To improve the performance of the algorithm in more realistic scenarios, Allen et al [38]_CITE replaced the simple Gaussian plume model with SCIPUFF"
This was also used by Long et al [60]_CITE to determine the location of a contaminant release
The sensitivity of the GA in STE was assessed in [82]_CITE
In [55]_CITE Annunzio et al combined the GA with the adjoint method in an Entity and Field framework (where entities are Gaussian plumes) for an improved estimate of the source term
"This had been demonstrated by Young et al [83]_CITE, and this required an input of a large amount of wind and concentration data"
"To estimate the source terms in a scenario of multiple releases, Annunzio et al [39]_CITE extend the Entity and Field framework approach to use multiple entities"

Here the MH procedure was applied with simulated tempering (ST) [89]_CITE
"In [32]_CITE, Yee used a reversible jump MCMC algorithm to detect multiple sources where the number of sources was unknown a priori"
[90]_CITE enables the Markov Chain to jump between model spaces of different dimensions
"In [33]_CITE, Yee improved the method by employing a simulated annealing scheme to move between the hypothesis space, increasing the mixing rate of the Markov Chains, which leads to faster convergence"
"Similarly to ST in [31]_CITE, the algorithm alters the likelihood function over time to facilitate the burn-in phase of MCMC"
"A real world application was presented in [91,92]_CITE by Yee et al Here, the location and emission rate of a source (from the Chalk River Laboratories medical isotope production facility) was estimated using a small number of activity concentration measurements of a noble gas (Xenon-133) obtained from three stations that form part of the International Monitoring System radionuclide network [92]_CITE"

They arise from an extension of the homogeneous chaos idea developed by Wiener [98]_CITE as a non-sampling based method to determine the evolution of uncertainty in a dynamical system
"To manage the non-polynomial nonlinearity difficulties in polynomial chaos integration, Dalbey et al proposed a formulation known as polynomial chaos quadrature (PCQ) [99]_CITE"
"In [49]_CITE, Madankan et al used a PCE based minimum variance approach for STE"
PCQ was implemented using the conjugate unscented transform method [100]_CITE to generate new sampling points from the posterior distribution using the Bayesian framework
"In [53]_CITE, more complex models were derived based on the characteristics of particular sensors and the agent"
This was achieved via: (i) a two step inference acceptance criteria so poor samples are not run in a dispersion model [53]_CITE; (ii) the adjoint source-receptor relationship [21]_CITE and (iii) by storing a library of pre-computed ATD simulations
Yee [33]_CITE determined the number of sources using simulated annealing to move a Markov Chain among parameter spaces and later work used a more efficient model selection method [34]_CITE
Yee discovered the significance of the representation of model errors and the loss in accuracy caused by differences between the dispersion model and the real dispersion event [92]_CITE
Ristic et al proposed several strategies to overcome the problems such as: making use of ABC to account for the fact it is nearly impossible to accurately know the exact model and sensor errors [36]_CITE; the use of multiple dispersion models to find the most appropriate one for the current scenario [46]_CITE; the use of binary measurements to reduce noise effects and enable the use of cheaper sensors [45]_CITE; and the use of binary sensors where the threshold was unknown was explored in [47]_CITE to account for sensor bias/drift and for easy inclusion of alternative data sources
The difficulty of estimating the strength of the release was highlighted further in [30]_CITE where algorithms attempted to estimate the strength of release from experimental data
"In the literature, boundary tracking algorithms have taken the form of control approaches [101 113]_CITE and estimation and control approaches [114 129]_CITE where several estimation techniques have been used to produce more informative trajectories"
"Many methods use the point measurement itself [107,109,110,118,119]_CITE or as a binary signal to determine whether or not the sensor is inside or out of the affected/contaminated region [6,101 105,116,117]_CITE"
"Some use an estimate of the gradient or Hessian of the contaminant obtained either through spatially separated simultaneous measurements by collaborating multiple sensors or via consecutive measurements by a single sensor [106,111,112,121,124 129]_CITE"
Another method is to estimate the curvature of the boundary; this has been done using several sensors in a formation or by visually estimating the curvature using a camera [7]_CITE
"Some have attempted to extend the state of the art, researching the effect of sensor noise and studying 3-D boundaries [125]_CITE"

"When applied to boundary tracking, sliding mode control [107]_CITE is similar to bang-bang control as both methods change the turning direction of the vehicle based on its position relative to the contour"
"In [107]_CITE, a sliding mode control law was used to steer a vehicle to a location where the distribution assumed a pre-specified value and afterwards ensured circulation of the vehicle along this set at the prescribed speed"

"Prior information, in terms of narrowing down possible source locations, can significantly improve performance of the approaches shown by the performance of [39]_CITE and [30]_CITE"
"Computational time has been reduced by applying a two step acceptance criteria in [53]_CITE to reduce the number of expensive dispersion model runs, and this could be reduced further by: adding more steps; improved generation of inferences; or by emulating the dispersion model [161,162]_CITE"
"In simplified simulations, current approaches have obtained more accurate, less uncertain estimates than static sensors thanks to their ability to sample from more informative locations [49]_CITE"
Thomson et al [51]_CITE applied SA to locate a gas source from measurements of concentration and wind data
"As every software artifact, also software models ( B zivin,_2005_CITE) are subject to continuous evolution"
"Knowing the operations applied between two successive versions of a model is not only crucial for helping developers to efficiently understand the model's evolution ( Koegel_et_al.,_2010_CITE), but it is also a major prerequisite for model management tasks, such as model co-evolution ( Herrmannsdoerfer_et_al.,_2009;_Mens,_2008_CITE) and model versioning ( Brosch_et_al.,_2010;_Koegel_et_al.,_2010_CITE)"
"The second category comprises composite operations ( Suny _et_al.,_2001_CITE) consisting of a set of cohesive atomic operations, which are applied within one transaction to achieve one common goal"
The most prominent class of such composite operations are refactorings introduced by Opdyke_(1992)_CITE
"As reported in Herrmannsdoerfer_et_al._(2009)_CITE, Mens_(2008)_CITE, Brosch_et_al._(2010)_CITE and Koegel_et_al._(2010)_CITE, the detection of applied refactorings is a crucial prerequisite for automating model management tasks"
"However, composite operations are not limited to refactorings; they may be used to implement any kind of in-place model transformation for a specific purpose, such as model completion ( Sen_et_al.,_2010_CITE), refinement ( Ruhroth_and_Wehrheim,_2012_CITE), and evolution ( Meyers_and_Vangheluwe,_2011_CITE)."
"One way to acquire the set of applied composite operations is to use operation recording ( Herrmannsdoerfer_and_K gel,_2010;_Lippe_and_Oosterom,_1992_CITE); that is, the execution of operations is tracked within the modeling environment while they are performed"
"A set of manually applied atomic operations, having together the intent of a composite operation, which is indeed frequently happening in practice ( Murphy-Hill_et_al.,_2009_CITE), cannot be identified, because no explicit command has been issued in the modeling environment"
"Finally, in a usual setting, the evolution of models is stored in terms of revisions in version control systems; consequently, the recorded operation logs ( Mens,_2002_CITE) are not available."
"In the absence of an operation log, the applied operations have to be detected a posteriori using state-based model comparison approaches using either generic model comparison algorithms ( Brun_and_Pierantonio,_2008;_Kelter_et_al.,_2005;_Lin_et_al.,_2007;_Schmidt_and_Gloetzner,_2008_CITE) or language-specific comparison algorithms ( Kolovos,_2009;_Xing_and_Stroulia,_2005_CITE)"
"In addition, the specifications for executing composite operations (eg, Henshin, Arendt_et_al.,_2010_CITE and EMO, Brosch_et_al.,_2009_CITE) and the implementation of the algorithms for detecting applications of them have to be kept consistent manually."
"In an endeavor to establish a commonly accepted conceptual framework for the rapidly growing number of domain-specific modeling environments, the Object Management Group (OMG) released the specification for Model Driven Architecture (MDA) ( Object_Management_Group,_2005_CITE), standardizing the definition and usage of (meta-)metamodels resulting in a metamodeling stack as depicted in Fig_1"
"An example operation specification is depicted using graph transformation syntax ( Heckel,_2006_CITE) in the lower part of Fig_2 for the refactoring Extract Superclass"
This transformation is the inverse of the transformation used in K hne_et_al._(2009)_CITE for generating a language-specific transformation language out of a modeling language
"( EMO) ( Brosch_et_al.,_2009_CITE), which basically implements the concepts of graph transformations"
"In EMO, the pre- and postconditions are expressed using the Object Constraint Language Object_Management_Group_(2010)_CITE (OCL)"
"We decided to use UUIDs in this case study to avoid affecting the results of this study by the selection of specific similarity-based matching heuristics ( Kolovos_et_al.,_2009_CITE)."
"Such approaches are often referred to as operation-based versioning/merging ( Lippe_and_Oosterom,_1992_CITE)"
"For instance, Dig_et_al._(2006)_CITE propose an approach to detect applied refactorings in Java code"
A similar approach is followed by Weissgerber_and_Diehl_(2006)_CITE
A heuristic-based approach is presented in Demeyer_et_al._(2000)_CITE in which a combination of various software measures as indicator for a certain refactoring is used
"First, there is the approach by Xing_and_Stroulia_(2006)_CITE for detecting refactorings in evolving software models which is integrated in UMLDiff"
"Second, the approach by Vermolen_et_al._(2011)_CITE copes with the detection of complex evolution steps between different versions of a metamodel"
"Third, K ster_et_al._(2008)_CITE calculate hierarchical change logs for process models"
Hartung_et_al._(2010)_CITE present an approach for generating so called semantically enriched evolution mappings between two versions of an ontology
"For limiting the search space of combinable composite operations, we may use the critical pair analysis comparable to how it has been done in Mens_(2006)_CITE."
"Assuming a stationary camera, which is a reasonable constraint for most applications, using scene specific information can help to reduce the number of false alarms (eg, Hoiem_et_al.,_2006_CITE)"
"In fact, to train such classifiers less training data is required and for the particular task they are usually better in terms of accuracy and efficiency ( Levin_et_al.,_2003;_Wu_and_Nevatia,_2007a;_Roth_et_al.,_2005_CITE)"
"Typical approaches are self-training (eg, Rosenberg_et_al.,_2005;_Li_et_al.,_2007_CITE), co-training (eg, Blum_and_Mitchell,_1998;_Levin_et_al.,_2003_CITE), semi-supervised learning (eg, Goldberg_et_al.,_2008_CITE), or the application of oracles 1An oracle can be considered a classifier, even at a low recall rate, having a high precision, which can be used to generate new training samples"
"To avoid drifting in classifier grids ( Roth_et_al.,_2009_CITE) applied fixed update strategies"
"Even though for most object detection scenarios a stationary camera can be assumed, this constraint, which could help to drastically improve the classification performance, has been only of limited interest (eg, Hoiem_et_al.,_2006;_Roth_and_Bischof,_2008;_Wu_and_Nevatia,_2007b;_Nair_and_Clark,_2004_CITE)"
"The main idea of classifier grids ( Grabner_et_al.,_2007;_Roth_et_al.,_2009_CITE) is to exploit the prior knowledge, that the camera is fixed"
"To overcome this problem, at time t fixed updates ( Grabner_et_al.,_2007_CITE) can be applied for updating a classifier C i , t 1"
"The first problem was addressed in Roth_et_al._(2009)_CITE, where the main idea was to further increase the stability and to speed up the computation by a combination of two generative models in parallel: a pre-trained model for the positive class and an adaptive model for the negative class"
The second problem was addressed in Stalder_et_al._(2009)_CITE and in Sternig_et_al._(2010b)_CITE
Stalder_et_al._(2009)_CITE introduced context-based classifier grids to extract additional positive information from a specific scene
"In contrast, in Sternig_et_al._(2010b)_CITE we proposed to use a co-training approach ( Classifier Co-Grids) in combination with a robust on-line learner"
"Building on ( Roth_et_al.,_2009_CITE) the model describing the object class (the positive model) is pre-calculated by off-line boosting for feature selection and only negative updates are performed"
"Having a large stack assures that the assumption for the negative bag containing at least one negative sample is mostly valid, since the probability that an object stays at one specific location over a longer period of time is very low ( Sternig_et_al.,_2010a_CITE)."
"However, in our case we apply the approximated median background model ( McFarlane_and_Schofield,_1995_CITE)"
"This causes short-term drifting in existing classifier grid approaches (eg, Roth_et_al.,_2009_CITE), which is in particular the problem addressed within this paper"
"For calculating the recall precision curves (RPC) a detection is counted as true positive if it fulfills the overlap criterion ( Agarwal_et_al.,_2004_CITE), where a minimal overlap of 50% is required."
"Finally, we want to demonstrate that the long-term stability, which was already shown for the original classifier grid approach in Roth_et_al._(2009)_CITE, also holds for the IMIL extension"
"As we already showed in Roth_et_al._(2009)_CITE that the approach is robust even when running in a real-world 24/7 setup, the goal of this paper was to address the problem of short-time drifting if objects are not moving for a longer period of time"
"One such situation involves the implementation of networks for engaging individuals in real business applications such as the evaluation of new or emerging technologies [1]_CITE, new product concepts [3,4,6]_CITE, and idea generation [8]_CITE"
Information preference markets (see discussion in [1]_CITE) have gained growing recognition as a relatively efficient process for gathering and aggregating information from a large number of dispersed individuals
Chen et al [2]_CITE argued that the assumption that traders are truth-telling might not be reasonable when an information market is relatively small
Van de Walle and Turoff [14]_CITE observed in their experiment that a large number of traders chose to follow market leaders instead of acting based on their private information
"The ability to carefully structure the settings and observe all individual activities and market occurrences makes laboratory experimentation an attractive process to address the questions of interest (see [5,7,9,10]_CITE)"
"Compared to such alternatives, on-line preference markets have the following advantages: (1) flexibility, (2) scalability, and (3) ability to incorporate and capture dynamic interactions among participants [4]_CITE."
"Gruca et al [6]_CITE used such markets to forecast new product success, finding results similar to those of surveys but with reduced variability of results"
LaComb et al [8]_CITE utilized preference markets in generating and evaluating new product ideas
"In a recent study of on-line preference market, Chen et al [1]_CITE investigated the use of such markets for evaluating and ranking emerging technologies"
"In the arena of prediction markets for predicting near future events, Wolfers and Zitzewitz [15]_CITE point out that earning through better prediction provides incentives for traders to reveal their true information"
"First, as Chen et al [1]_CITE discussed in the area of emerging technologies, there is the question of whether the preferences observed and aggregated are sufficiently closely aligned with a panel of experts so that a company might use the scalable and more flexible preference markets to substitute for expense, non-scalable, and often inflexible panels of experts"
"While Chen et al [1]_CITE focused on the former, in this paper we focus on the latter."
"As noted, earlier work by Chen et al [1]_CITE detailed the structure of on-line preference market and presented the results and analysis of a full scale on-line preference market for emerging technologies"
"If a firm (such as the partner firm in [1]_CITE) has utilized panels of experts over time and their analysis indicates very positive outcomes, then consistency of the outcomes with those of the panel of experts is certainly a positive for the that firm"
"It is a common observation that the processing, storage, and networking capabilities of computers and eScience or cyberinfrastructure systems [1,2]_CITE generally have grown at different rates in the past decade"
"Data production is changing in a variety of ways: new capabilities of the most advanced supercomputers generate prodigious amounts of data for example, COLA (Center for Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies) produces roughly 1.8 petabytes (PB) of data per year [3]_CITE; a single next-generation DNA sequencing system can produce more than 350 terabytes (TB) of data per day [4]_CITE; and sensor nets such as the Earth Science Data and Information System create 2.9 TB per day [5]_CITE."
"When working within the context of a Virtual Organization (VO), the goal of campus bridging is to make the virtual aspect of the organization irrelevant (or helpful) to the work of the VO [6]_CITE"
"For example, within the US, XSEDE [7]_CITE partner institutions make two very large supercomputers available to the US research community the two track II systems (the 579 TFLOPS Ranger at TACC [8]_CITE and the 1.17 PFLOPS Kraken at NICS [9]_CITE)"
"This testbed was in operation between Technische Universit t Dresden [10]_CITE and Technische Universit t Bergakademie Freiberg [11]_CITE between June 11, 2010 and May 31, 2011"
"The partners in creating the testbed included Technische Universit t Dresden, Technische Universit t Bergakademie Freiberg, Alcatel-Lucent [12]_CITE, Indiana University [13]_CITE, T-Systems GMBH [14]_CITE, Fraunhofer ITWM [15]_CITE, Hewlett Packard (HP) [16]_CITE, DataDirect Networks (DDN) [17]_CITE, VMware [18]_CITE, interface:systems [19]_CITE, and Whamcloud, Inc"
"As of the latest list of the 500 fastest supercomputers in the world [22]_CITE, about 50% of the hundred fastest use Lustre as their scratch file system"
"Lustre was used in production for the TeraGrid globally accessible file system from 2008 [23,24]_CITE to the end of the TeraGrid project in June 2011"
"We have demonstrated the value of remote file systems mounts, using Lustre, as a way to transport data effectively and efficiently to enable wide area distributed workflows [25,26]_CITE"
"There has been one head-to-head test between Lustre and GPFS at the SC07 Bandwidth Challenge, a Lustre-based system achieved a greater peak bidirectional bandwidth of data movement than GPFS (or any other file system participating in that contest) [27]_CITE"
"The latency of the different components was determined with the help of BenchIT [31]_CITE by sending a 64 byte TCP/IP message to a server, which sent it back"
Techniques learned in tuning a standard 10 Gbps connection were of significant aid [32]_CITE
"It is widely used for evaluating POSIX I/O [34]_CITE, MPI I/O [35]_CITE, and HDFS [36]_CITE data movement performance."
"In early November 2010, Indiana University Pervasive Technology Institute announced the saturation of first commercial 100 Gbps link [37]_CITE."
We instrumented IOR with VampirTrace [38]_CITE to better understand the performance characteristics of the system in the burst tests
"Using an experimental tool currently under development at ZIH [10]_CITE, these statistics were added to the Vampir analysis of the data"
7 shows an overview of the full run visualized with Vampir7 [39]_CITE made on the 60 km testbed
An investigation revealed that Lustre locks the individual file stripes in a sequential fashion [39]_CITE
"For this reason, we looked at simulating the additional latency using a program called netem [41]_CITE."
The author of netem says that it works best with single network streams [42]_CITE
"In the early 1990s, a number of facial expression recognition researchers had a motivation of revolutionising the way we interact with technology [1]_CITE by enabling it to become more human like"
It has been over 15 years since [1]_CITE was published in the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
"As announced recently by the Wall Street Journal, Apple has just bought Emotient [4]_CITE, a startup company that utilises artificial intelligence to analyze facial expressions and read emotions'"
"While attempting to answer the abovementioned questions, we need to keep in mind that since the publication of the PAMI surveys in 2000 [1]_CITE and 2009 [2]_CITE, our understanding of how humans and technology interact has changed considerably as social media and mobile phones have become the predominant ways in which we interact with technology."
"We already know that not all aspects of emotions can be measured using the same sensors; for instance, the arousal dimension is known to be better communicated with nonvisual signals such as voice or with physiological signals [2]_CITE"
"Generally, a centrifugally cast product has a superior mechanical properties compared to conventional gravitational castings [1]_CITE."
Numerical studies solving the flow dynamics were mostly using the VOF method [2]_CITE to capture the interface between the liquid layer and the surrounding air
The simulations performed by Xu [3]_CITE were terminated at 30 and thus; only the filling stage of the casting could be analyzed
A commercial code (STAR-CD V4) was used also in a work done by Prasad [5]_CITE
"For example in [6]_CITE, Drenchev introduced a numerical model discussing some aspects of macrosegregation of reinforcing particles in a metal matrix"
"Similar numerical models can be found in [7,8]_CITE"
Details about the heat transfer and solidification model are discussed in [10]_CITE.
The SWE are typically applied in modeling of oceanography [11]_CITE and river flows [12]_CITE
"The SWE can effectively and accurately predict the speed and the amplitude of a propagating tsunami, a tidal bore or any other wave until it breaks into a 3D flow structure [13]_CITE"
"In that case, different SWE are used for each layer and coupling terms provide the desired interaction between these layers [14]_CITE."
"During the observation of the real casting, the liquid melt seems to quickly pick up the speed of the rotating mold [15]_CITE"
More details about such relations can be found eg in [16]_CITE
The 2D set of Eq (22) can be broken down to two 1D sets of equations by the dimensional splitting [17]_CITE
"A Roe linearization [18]_CITE is applied in order to find special averages u ,v ,T andh"
"In the present paper, the correct solution is restored by applying the Harten Hyman entropy fix [19]_CITE."
"Then, any h In addition to the numerical limit due to the occurrence of the negative height [22]_CITE, a physical limit is applied to prevent incorrect evaluation of the friction source term [16]_CITE based on the fact that none of the friction terms cannot change the sign of the intermediate state hvm (32)"
"The HR corrections are added to the Godunov updating formula (39) as the following: (41)(Q)i,jn+1=(Q)i,jn- t yB+( Q)i,j-12n+B-( Q)i,j+12n- t y(G)i,j+1/2n-(G)i,j-1/2nwith G the correction term calculated at fi,j-1/2 and fi,j+1/2 takes the form (42)G=12 p=14| p|1- t y| p|rp( p+ p) ( p)with ( p) the limiter function located within the TVD region [23]_CITE"
"In the present model, the MC flux limiter was considered [24]_CITE"
"The stability region is controlled by the convective limit CFL (Courant Friedrichs Lewy) [25]_CITE and the time step t is determined as the following: (43) t=CFL y/max| p| The grid size sensitivity study was performed on a 1D grid, 2 R long, with a uniformly spaced grid points (100, 400, or 1000), aligned with the tangential direction ie with periodic boundary conditions applied"
"In addition to the numerical limit due to the occurrence of the negative height [22]_CITE, a physical limit is applied to prevent incorrect evaluation of the friction source term [16]_CITE based on the fact that none of the friction terms cannot change the sign of the intermediate state hvm (32)"
"When HTC introduced the Windows-based smartphone, it recruited 1000 T-Mobile or AT&T customers to write product reviews and Facebook and Twitter posts, reaching more than 234,000 consumers and significantly increasing the brand awareness [12]_CITE"
"When Dunkin Donuts launched Latte Lite, it used 3000 consumers to spread the word about the new beverage, reaching 111,272 consumers over twelve weeks and increasing sales by 26% in test markets [13]_CITE"
Both examples illustrate that electronic or online word of mouth (eWOM) has become an important factor in consumer buying decisions [37]_CITE
"Consumers trust eWOM more than advertisements, as they regard their peers as more reliable than companies [65]_CITE"
"As such, companies receiving favorable eWOM have a better chance to increase sales [21]_CITE"
"Although eWOM is implemented by consumers, companies can initiate eWOM campaigns for marketing communications [35]_CITE"
"To launch an effective eWOM campaign, companies need to identify a small number of disseminators known as opinion leaders who exert personal influence upon other people [68]_CITE"
"Identification of opinion leaders relies on the two-step flow of communications theory: as senders, opinion leaders cultivate their knowledge from a variety of sources including mass media in the first step, and then spread their opinions (messages) to the general public (receivers) via WOM in the second step [47]_CITE"
"Thus, sender, message, and receiver are key components in the WOM process [6,20]_CITE, and provide three important bases for searching for opinion leaders"
"Information on WOM content (ie, message) has generally been unavailable to companies in the past because interpersonal communication such as a chat between friends leaves no record for analysis [20]_CITE"
"As a result, researchers turn to senders and ask whether they really are opinion leaders by a questionnaire survey [50]_CITE"
"However, a survey may capture self-confidence rather than opinion leadership for two reasons [61,68]_CITE"
The network structure approach can identify senders who are highly connected with receivers in a social network [41]_CITE
"The network structure approach also requires knowledge on consumers social networks that are often private information [5,43]_CITE"
"Unlike traditional WOM, eWOM leaves digital records on the Internet, and therefore provides companies with accessible information [20]_CITE"
"Since message is a key component in the original theory by Katz and Lazarsfeld [47]_CITE, we wonder: Can companies explore the rich information contained in eWOM message to identify opinion leaders? If so, can companies use such opinion leaders as disseminators to launch effective marketing campaigns via their eWOM?"
"The second type is buzz-generating opinion leaders whose online reviews generate contagious talk about a brand, service, product, or idea [11]_CITE"
"Although the exact ranking method is a secret, communicativeness and trustworthiness are reported to be important factors [66]_CITE"
"Opinion leader WOM has long been used to promote products or to criticize competitors offerings [44,47]_CITE; its positive impact on new product introduction was first reported by Arndt [3]_CITE"
"What sets eWOM apart from traditional WOM is the combination of (1) unprecedented scale, (2) the possibilities for eWOM designers to control and monitor eWOM operation, and (3) unique properties of online interaction [26]_CITE"
"One of the most important capabilities of the Internet is interactive communication at a larger scale: for the first time in human history, individuals can make their personal thoughts, reactions, and opinions easily accessible to the global community of Internet users , and the interactive communication provides an online feedback mechanism to serve multiple functions, including brand building and customer acquisition, product development and quality control, and supply chain quality assurance [26]_CITE."
Electronic commerce performs better than the traditional market in acquiring customers [77]_CITE
"However, their main purpose is to save decision time and to make better decisions [40]_CITE"
"For such reasons, companies are interested in providing eWOM as free sales assistance [18]_CITE"
"In order to identify key eWOM disseminators, companies need to understand why review writers post their opinions, and prior research suggests the following reasons: (1) to add value to community by helping others (focus-related utility), (2) to seek advice from other community members after purchasing (consumption utility), (3) to gain approval from other community members (approval utility), (4) to moderate consumer interaction with other consumer and companies (moderator utility), and (5) to balance their emotions through expressing their opinions (homeostase utility) [39]_CITE."
"To be effective in viral marketing campaigns, companies must identify opinion leaders properly and then let them communicate information to their followers [43]_CITE"
Opinion leaders are consumers who provide information to others that influences their consumption decisions [22]_CITE by obtaining key information through research and shaping their own opinions earlier than the general public
"Opinion leaders in women fashion, for example, acquire fashion knowledge from fashion magazines first and then spread it to followers via WOM [70]_CITE."
"Rogers and Cartano [68]_CITE summarize three methods of identifying opinion leaders: (1) the self-report method, ie using surveys to ask consumers to identify whether and to what extent they are opinion leaders; (2) the key informant method, ie using surveys to ask consumers whom they listen to; and (3) the network structure method, ie using social networks to compute network centrality and other network structure-related measures"
"In addition, consumer demographics [1]_CITE and loyalty [35]_CITE are considered in conjunction with surveys to identify opinion leaders"
"However, self-reported surveys may capture self-confidence rather than opinion leadership [2,42]_CITE"
Rogers and Cartano [68]_CITE noted that sender-based surveys are dependent upon the accuracy with which respondents [senders] can assess and report their self-images on opinion leadership
"Both self-report and peer-nominated methods share survey biases such as inconsistent interpretation of survey questions and recall inaccuracy, which can lead to overestimation or underestimation of the degree of opinion leadership [24]_CITE"
"The network structure method has been widely used by marketers and network analysis researchers [41,43]_CITE"
"Network analysis determines opinion leaders by identifying those who connect with many people (ie, hubs) and those who connect two clusters of densely connected people (ie, bridges) in a social network [41]_CITE"
"However, other researchers suggest that impact of WOM is driven by a large number of easily influenced people rather than by opinion leaders [74]_CITE"
The receiver-based approach is built upon the argument that opinion leaders spread word of mouth via their personal influence networks [67]_CITE
"Since the advent of the Internet in the 1990s, WOM is no longer restricted to personal influence networks because the Internet allows one to reach strangers at a larger scale [26]_CITE"
"While individuals can arguably expand their social network to include the strangers, Dunbar number (150) suggests a cognitive limitation in the number of social relationships that people can maintain [30]_CITE"
Existing evidence suggests that the Internet does not remove the cognitive/biological constraints on human communication [36]_CITE
"As noted by Weimann and colleagues, the network structure method works best in a closed, self-contained social setting, such as hospitals, prisons, or army bases [75]_CITE"
"However, a defining feature of eWOM is its potential to reach large numbers of strangers outside a sender own social network [26]_CITE"
"In the original voting study that introduced the concept of opinion leader , Lazarsfeld and colleagues wrote that opinion leaders were the interested, highly articulate voters who gave political advice or even tried to convert other citizens [52]_CITE"
"Thus, a key behavior of eWOM opinion leaders is their ability to communicate with other consumers about their product experience [28]_CITE"
The reasons for communication can be either altruistic or self-serving: to help consumers and companies sell products [72]_CITE or to reduce opinion leaders emotional tension when they feel strongly about a product [28]_CITE
"In their survey which became the basis for sender-based methods, King and Summers [50]_CITE ask consumers whether they like to talk to their friends (Item 1 in their scale) and similar questions (Items 3, 5, and 6)"
Godes & Mayzlin [35]_CITE adopted the King and Summers scale to measure how many followers an opinion leader reaches
"Buzz is generated around a product when a large number of followers receive eWOM [11,31]_CITE"
Previous studies suggest that opinion leaders are progressive attention-seekers [70]_CITE and fulfill their self-enhancement motivation via buzz creation [33]_CITE
"The reviews written by buzz-generating opinion leaders can increase product/brand awareness among followers, which benefits sales whether the buzz is positive or negative [7]_CITE"
"Trust is an important issue in electronic commerce and eWOM studies (eg, [26,80]_CITE), as it is one of the main reasons for followers to seek advice from opinion leaders"
"Although an expert in a broadcast knows more about voting than the average citizen, followers can trust the judgment and evaluation of the respected people among their associates [52]_CITE"
"For example, the dual-process theory suggests that consumers find information from trustworthy sources more persuasive [15,64]_CITE"
"King and Summers [50]_CITE measure this characteristic by asking (Item 7): Do you have the feeling that you are generally regarded by your friends and neighbors as a good source of advice about [products]? In the offline world, WOM is spread through consumers who know each other, such as friends and neighbors; in an online setting, eWOM is disseminated freely among strangers"
"Manipulating online user reviews is a known phenomenon [62]_CITE, which makes it important for consumers to receive eWOM from trustworthy opinion leaders"
"An indirect approach to measure trustworthiness is analyzing the structural, lexical, and semantic aspects of eWOM, which are found to be associated with trustworthiness [10]_CITE"
"Consumers do not know all opinion leaders, as consumers only know a limited number of peers [30]_CITE, and companies cannot directly compare different opinion leaders reported in either the self-report or key informant approaches"
"The amount of eWOM influences consumers in two ways: eWOM increases exposure to a product and therefore increases consumer awareness of its existence [54]_CITE; and a large amount of eWOM suggests a product popularity [17,79]_CITE"
"Previous studies reveal that the amount of eWOM created by the general public drives sales [21,27,29,54]_CITE"
"Consumers communicate their satisfaction using online user ratings [18,71]_CITE"
"Positive ratings created by the general public can improve consumer attitude, while negative ratings created by the general public can worsen consumer attitude [54]_CITE"
"Customer satisfaction among the general public has been found to have a positive impact on future sales [4,78]_CITE"
"To understand whether opinion leaders can be used as disseminators to launch effective marketing campaigns via eWOM, it is important to consider who they are [46]_CITE"
Opinion leaders have strong personal interest in products and are enthusiastic about product ownership and use [72]_CITE
"They are also motivated to contribute their knowledge to other consumers [19,39]_CITE"
"Merton [56]_CITE discussed two types of opinion leaders: monomorphic opinion leaders are experts in a limited number of product categories, while polymorphic opinion leaders have knowledge in a variety of product categories"
"According to Childers [22]_CITE, opinion leadership is product category specific"
"In contrast, Feick and Price [34]_CITE found influential consumers, or market mavens, who have broad product category knowledge"
"Identifying opinion leaders from observed behaviors such as WOM is the most expensive method, although highly accurate [75]_CITE"
"Fortunately, online user reviews are now available to companies and can serve as a proxy for overall WOM [79]_CITE"
This approach is consistent with recent research findings that link online consumer behavior with product sales [51]_CITE
"Our dataset contains a sample of 350,122 book, music, video and DVD titles, which, as experience goods, have qualities difficult to ascertain before consumption, making user reviews helpful for consumers [60,63]_CITE"
"Although some researchers treat all reviewers as opinion leaders [25]_CITE, we are interested in examining a much smaller set of reviewers because it is costly for a company to recruit all available reviewers [75]_CITE"
"The theoretical basis for considering a subset of reviewers is that opinion leadership is not a dichotomy; rather, it varies in a continuous fashion [22,67]_CITE"
The overlap between different types of opinion leaders is consistent with extant literature [43]_CITE.
"The extant literature seems to imply that marketers only need to focus on two product effects [21,23]_CITE"
"Previous research suggests that an opinion leader needs to have both knowledge and influence [47,57]_CITE"
"Since opinion leaders have different breadths of product category knowledge, it is important to examine which kinds of opinion leaders can be more effective in driving sales [34]_CITE"
"Katz and Lazarsfeld [47]_CITE argue that personal influence does not flow from highly interested individuals to less interested individuals, but rather between those with shared interests"
"Therefore, if general knowledge implies general interest, an opinion leader with broad product category knowledge will attract more followers [58]_CITE."
Many executives have little idea of how to orchestrate a marketing campaign that exploits the full power of opinion leader eWOM [31]_CITE
Our paper fills the gap by studying opinion leader and eWOM together as the original interpersonal communication theory intends [47]_CITE.
"By using this new approach, we identify communicative, buzz-generating, and trustworthy opinion leaders and find their eWOM positively associated with product sales, contrary to a prior study that has raised doubts about the influence of opinion leaders [74]_CITE"
"Most researchers characterize opinion leadership as a combination of knowledge and influence, but the breadth of product knowledge can vary from several to many product categories [34,50]_CITE"
Marketing practitioners claim that 10% of the population tells the rest how to make purchase decision [48]_CITE
"For example, Hasbro demonstrated how an effective viral WOM campaign could be in 2001 [69]_CITE"
Philips worked with BzzAgent to create a WOM campaign for its SONICCARE electric toothbrush in 2006 [14]_CITE
"Opinion leader WOM has become so important to the pharmaceutical industry that the top 15 drug companies spent a third of their marketing expenditures on opinion leaders in 2004 [32]_CITE, though industry practitioners observe that the practice of identifying opinion leaders is ad hoc [49]_CITE"
"Fashion industry companies use celebrities such as Madonna as opinion leaders [76]_CITE, while the pharmaceutical industry uses physicians on editorial boards/scientific committees and with prestigious academic appointments [32,38,49]_CITE"
"For example, marketers used surveys to find the popular children selected as disseminators in Hasbro P-O-X campaign [55]_CITE, and pharmaceutical marketers are increasingly using network analysis methods to find opinion leaders [45,73]_CITE."
"For example, the eWOM company BzzAgent measures engagement as the number of likes, comments, and retweets a consumer post receives [9]_CITE"
This article presents a new opinion leader identification method rooted in the interpersonal communication theory that inspired sender- and receiver-based methods [47]_CITE
"By demonstrating how to identify opinion leaders from a large number of consumers, this article shows that companies can collect useful business intelligence from increasingly large amounts of data available to them a central theme emerging in big data analytics [16]_CITE."
"Is it possible to escape the alternative to either make the hardly justifiable assumption that there is a unique true/natural/real clustering against which the quality of cluster analysis methods can be objectively assessed, or to think that cluster analysis is somehow arbitrary and more of an art than a science [1]_CITE?"
Similar ideas have recently been discussed in [2]_CITE and [1]_CITE
"My starting point in this respect is my constructivist philosophy of mathematical modeling as outlined in [3]_CITE, which is connected to radical constructivism [4]_CITE and social constructionism [5]_CITE"
"Although constructivism is often interpreted as anti-realist, I complement my constructivist view here by the active scientific realism introduced by Hasok Chang [6]_CITE"
The term truth is constructivist used in both Chang [6]_CITE and the constructivist literature as a relative concept internal to systems of practice
"For example, biological species and chemical elements are considered as candidates for being natural kinds [8]_CITE"
"For such reasons, for example Goodman [9]_CITE rejected the term natural for kinds"
"Hacking [10]_CITE argued that natural kinds should refer to kinds that are connected to human activity and utility, which allows for non-uniform and more pluralist kinds"
"Such an experience always has to be framed by the make-up of the personal and social realities that are involved, it may change, and controversy persists even about central candidates for natural kinds such as biological species [11]_CITE and chemical elements [6]_CITE"
Van Mechelen et al [12]_CITE review cognitive theories of categorization with a view to connecting them to inductive data analysis including clustering
"From a constructivist perspective, von Foerster [13]_CITE saw objects in human perception as eigenvalues (fixed points) of recursive coordinations of actions, which has a reflection in self-organizing clustering algorithms"
"However, formal and algorithmic views of categories have strong limitations, and it has been pointed out that in order to understand human categorization, context such as the conditions of the human body, a metaphorical or theoretical framework in which a category is embedded [14]_CITE, Chapter 7 of [12]_CITE and the ever-changing social and communicative environment [5]_CITE need to be taken into account."
"Another line of research concerns intuitive clustering by humans of two dimensional point clouds, regardless of the meaning of the points, see [15,16]_CITE, with mixed results in the sense that there are predominant strategies such as looking for high density areas and for shapes of similar kinds ( model fitting ), but there is also considerable variation, although Lewis et al [17]_CITE argue that humans and particularly experts are more consistent in assessing clusterings than existing cluster validation indexes."
"For example, in biological species delimitation, the concept of a species is often defined in terms of interbreeding (there is some controversy, see [11]_CITE)"
"Marx made ownership of means of production the major defining characteristic of different classes, but social classes can also be defined by looking at patterns of contact, or occupation, or education, or wealth, or by a mixture of these [20]_CITE"
Several of these are related with the formal categorization principles listed in Section 14.2.2.1 of [12]_CITE
"As another example, stability can refer to sampling other data from the same population (this may play a privileged role in hypothesis driven repeated experiments aiming at reproducible results, which is often identified with the scientific method; see [21]_CITE for some results and critical remarks), to adding noise , or to comparing results from different clustering algorithms."
"The idea of listing potentially desirable characteristics of clusterings for helping with the selection of clustering methods is central also to [2]_CITE, but the axiomatic characteristics listed there are strikingly different from the present list"
"As necessary for the theoretical analysis, the characteristics in [2]_CITE are formal"
"Ackerman et al [22]_CITE and [23]_CITE investigated cluster analysis approaches with respect to further formal characteristics, which are related to some of the characteristics listed above"
"Similar considerations can be found in [1]_CITE, which are closer to the present approach, but somewhat less detailed"
"It is necessarily idealized and abstract, and discrepancies between such a definition and the more complex and informal ideas that researchers have about reality should not be suppressed just (see [3]_CITE)."
Another approach would be the definition of an aim-dependent cluster quality index as a weighted mean of appropriately scaled statistics measuring cluster characteristics as listed in Section 3.3 (in [1]_CITE there is a related discussion of measuring and optimizing usefulness of clusters)
"In an implicit manner, internal cluster validation indexes [24]_CITE such as the average silhouette width attempt to aggregate desirable features of clusterings, and true clusters could be defined by optimizing them, although such criteria are usually designed with the aim of defining a too general notion of cluster quality, which does not take into account the differences between clustering aims in practice."
Some other work explores notions of clusterability of data [25]_CITE
Ackerman and Ben-David [26]_CITE reveal that there are several reasonable notions that contradict each other in many situations.
"One may wonder whether mixtures of homogeneous distributions such as the Gaussian should be interpreted as single clusters if their mixture is homogeneous enough, which allows for more flexible cluster shapes, but violates identifiability and requires the researcher to define under what conditions mixture components should be merged [27]_CITE."
For every distribution P with a density and k modes there are distributions without an existing density and distributions with an arbitrarily higher number of density modes that are so similar to P that they cannot be distinguished by an arbitrarily large amount of data [28]_CITE
"E.g., Pollard [29]_CITE proved the consistency of k-means applied to data as estimator for the k-means functional"
"Davies [30]_CITE argued (for linear regression) that statisticians should be interested in estimating globally defined and continuous functionals of distributions, because only such functionals cannot change arbitrarily in the neighborhood of a distribution"
"Other characteristics such as stability are not involved in the definition of most clustering methods, but can be used to validate clusterings and to compare clusterings from different methods by use of resampling techniques [31]_CITE"
"I have hardly seen any study in which different clusterings of the same data or of data from the same probability model have been treated as legitimate and were used to tell the implicit cluster concepts of different models apart ( [22,23,27]_CITE are examples where this is done)"
A number of these decisions is discussed in [20]_CITE.
"Fractional calculus and fractional differential equations have been used in various areas of the applications, for instance bioengineering [4]_CITE, physics [2,23]_CITE, chaos theory [11]_CITE, viscoelasticity [5]_CITE, control system engineering [1,7,13,22]_CITE, fractional signal processing techniques [18]_CITE and many others areas (see eg [8,10,17]_CITE)"
Such approach was already used for modeling the diffusion process described by integer-order differential equation [3]_CITE
"For numerical computation of the fractional-order partial differential equation a matrix approach has been used [15,16]_CITE."
"The (x) function is given in the following way [13]_CITE: (1) (x)= 0 e-ttx-1dt,where R(x)>0."
"The formula for the Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional derivative (2) has the form [13]_CITE: (3) 0 e-st0Dt f(t)dt=s F(s)- k=0n-1s -k-1f(k)(0)for n-1 One of a good example of diffusion process is a heat transfer action, when a heat (energy, temperature) is transported through a material"
"As it was presented in Podlubny and Sierociuk et al [13,19]_CITE the following relation between the heat flux and the temperature at the desired point holds (it can be obtained during solving the Eq (9) in Laplace domain): (11)H(t, )=1a 0.5 t0.5T(t, )"
This approach is based on the fact that operation of the fractional calculus can be expressed by matrix [16]_CITE
"It follows from Podlubny [14]_CITE, that the left-sided Riemann Liouville or Caputo fractional derivative v( )(t)=0Dt v(t) can be approximated in all nodes of the equidistant discretization net t=j ( j=0,1, ,n) simultaneously with the help of the upper triangular strip matrix Bn( ) as: (18)vn( )vn-1( ) v1( )v0( )T=Bn( )vnvn-1 v1v0T,where (19)Bn( )=1 0( ) 1( ) n-1( ) n( )0 0( ) 1( ) n-1( )00 0( ) 1( ) 0 00 0( ) 1( )00 00 0( ) (20) j( )=(-1)j j,j=0,1, ,n"
"The symmetric Riesz derivative of order can be approximated based on its definition as a combination of the approximations (18) and (21) for the left and right-sided Riemann Liouville derivatives, or using the centered fractional differences approximation of the symmetric Riesz derivative suggested recently by Ortigueira [9]_CITE"
"It has been shown in Podlubny [14]_CITE that all values of th order time derivative of u(x,t) at these nodes are approximated using the discrete analogue of differentiation of arbitrary order: (27)ui,n( )ui,n-1( ) ui,2( )ui,1( )ui,0( )=Bn( )ui,nui,n-1 ui,2ui,1ui,0T"
"In order to obtain a simultaneous approximation of th order time derivative of u(x,t) in all nodes, we need to arrange all function values uij at the discretization nodes to the form of a column vector unm=[ ]T, which has the structure described in Podlubny et al [16]_CITE"
"Similarly, the matrix that transforms the vector U to the vector Ux( ) of the partial fractional derivative of order with respect to spatial variable can be obtained as a Kronecker product of the unit matrix En (recall that m is the number of spatial discretization nodes), and the matrix Rm( ), which corresponds to a symmetric Riesz ordinary derivative of order [9]_CITE, (recall that m is the number of time steps): (29)Smn( )=En Rm( )"
"The bullwhip effect also has a close link with the philosophy of lean production ( Ohno,_1988_CITE)"
Indeed Ohno_(1988)_CITE discusses the benefits of bullwhip avoidance: The slower but consistent tortoise causes less waste and is much more desirable than the speedy hare that races ahead and then stops occasionally to doze
"For example, Geary,_Disney,_and_Towill_(2006)_CITE classified five routes to increase our knowledge of bullwhip effect and 10 principles to reduce it"
"Miragliotta_(2006)_CITE reviewed bullwhip research in three categories; empirical assessment, causes, and remedies, and then proposed a new taxonomy to model this problem"
"Giard_and_Sali_(2013)_CITE categorised 53 bullwhip papers within 13 coordinates, including modelling approaches, demand models, measures, and causes"
"Other reviews are more conceptually oriented, attempting to offer a new perspective on bullwhip ( Towill,_Zhou,_&_Disney,_2007_CITE)."
"Some reviews are not solely confined to the bullwhip effect, but also cover other supply chain modelling issues ( Beamon,_1998;_Min_&_Zhou,_2002;_Sarimveis,_Patrinos,_Tarantilis,_&_Kiranoudis,_2008_CITE)"
"The bullwhip effect has also been frequently mentioned in review papers dedicated to other topics, such as information sharing ( Sahin_&_Robinson,_2002_CITE) and reverse logistics ( Govindan,_Soleimani,_&_Kannan,_2014_CITE)"
"Interestingly, a similar phenomenon between P&G and its wholesalers has been documented during 1910s ( Schisgall,_1981_CITE)"
"Evidence can also be found in pasta ( Hammond,_1994_CITE), automotive ( Taylor,_1999_CITE), and retail ( Lai,_2005_CITE) industry case studies."
"Sterman_(1989)_CITE published 20 years of data from the game attributing the amplification to the tendency that players overlook the inventory-on-order (the orders placed but not yet received), a cause of amplification known as irrational behaviour ."
"The production smoothing hypothesis ( Holt,_Modigliani,_Muth,_&_Simon,_1960_CITE) assumes that production fluctuations increase the operational cost to the manufacturer by inducing excess machine setup, idle time and workforce hiring/firing"
"This is a standard assumption in the bullwhip literature and is different from the assumption of a fixed ordering cost in other inventory management literature (see eg Clark_&_Scarf,_1960_CITE)."
"There is also a trade-off between inventory cost and production cost, due to the stabilizing effect of inventory ( Baganha_&_Cohen,_1998;_Disney,_Towill,_&_van_de_Velde,_2004_CITE)"
"Chen_and_Samroengraja_(2004)_CITE showed that when the cost function is concave, the replenishment policy that minimises order fluctuations is not necessarily the one that minimises total cost."
"Such comparison can be made by either a ratio or a difference, where amplification (smoothing) is indicated by a ratio larger (smaller) than one, or a difference greater (less) than zero ( Cachon,_Randall,_&_Schmidt,_2007_CITE)"
"Due to data availability, some empiricists use alternatives such as production quantity, sales and shipments which are easier to observe than orders and demand ( Blinder_&_Maccini,_1991_CITE)"
"That is, to measure bullwhip by the variance of order changes instead of the variance of orders itself ( West,_1986_CITE)"
"Alternatively one may compare the difference between order variances and demand variances which has been proved to be finite ( Gaalman_&_Disney,_2012_CITE)"
"However, Bray_and_Mendelson_(2015)_CITE argued that if we alter the measurement of bullwhip effect from an increase of order variability to that of order uncertainty, then these two effects may coexist."
"This effect is considered to be an important cause of business and economic cycles ( Clark,_1917;_Mitchell,_1913;_Samuelson,_1939_CITE)"
"Vaile,_Grether,_and_Cox_(1952)_CITE reported that the production of consumer goods is estimated to have fallen from an index of 100 80 during the 1929 1932 depression, while that of all capital equipment fell from 100 to 35"
Bishop_(1984)_CITE provided evidence of the amplification effect between fossil-fuel demand and turbo machinery demand
"The cause was attributed to the time delay in capacity investment and the speed of machine wear-out ( Hicks,_1950_CITE)."
"In 1960 Holt_et_al._(1960_CITE) proposed the production smoothing model assuming that rational decisions regarding production quantities would lower costs by levelling production, with inventory being used as a buffer"
"Efforts have been made to optimise this model under various assumptions ( Gaalman,_1978;_Schneeweiss,_1974;_Zangwill,_1966_CITE)"
"Quite contrarily, many empirical studies have found amplification between retail sales and production orders, as well as positive correlation between demand and inventory ( Blanchard,_1983;_Blinder,_1986;_Blinder_&_Maccini,_1991;_West,_1986_CITE)"
"Therefore, price and seasonality are often commingled with quantity data and deflation and deseasonalisation techniques are required ( Allen,_1999_CITE)"
"Others advocate that production smoothing is more easily found when demand has a predictable seasonal component ( Ghali,_1987_CITE)"
Wang_(2002)_CITE extracted data from 46 product items and pinpoints price variation as a contributing factor to the production smoothing phenomenon
"However, incorporation of price and seasonal fluctuation does not always generate results in support of production smoothing ( Miron_&_Zeldes,_1988_CITE)"
"Other factors, such as non-convex costs, random prices, variable target stocks and lost sales have also appeared in explanations of the excess volatility ( Blinder,_1986;_Kahn,_1992;_Milne,_1994;_Ramey,_1991;_West,_1986_CITE)."
Ghali_(2003)_CITE showed that production smoothing can be found only in a small number of industries where seasonality is stable and inventory holding cost is low
"In 75 industries, Cachon_et_al._(2007)_CITE observed that 61 exhibited bullwhip when seasonality was removed, but only 39 when not"
"Similar findings have been reported by Bray_and_Mendelson_(2012)_CITE, on the basis of firm-level, rather than industry-level, data"
"Other studies, including those conducted by Fair_(1989),_Ghali_(1974)_CITE and Krane_and_Braun_(1991)_CITE, were in favour of the smoothing hypothesis."
"Baganha_and_Cohen_(1998)_CITE observed that bullwhip effect appears in the wholesaler's echelon, and argued that the wholesaler's inventory acts as a stabiliser in the chain"
"industry-level data, Cachon_et_al._(2007)_CITE also found that bullwhip primarily appears in the wholesaler, rather than in the retailer or manufacturer, echelon"
"Dooley,_Yan,_Mohan,_and_Gopalakrishnan_(2010)_CITE studied the bullwhip effect during the 2007 2009 recession and concluded that retailers responded to market changes rapidly and adaptively, whereas wholesalers responded late and drastically."
"Mollick_(2004)_CITE described evidence of production smoothing in the Japanese automotive industry, where the production smoothing is more common due to the prevalence of Heijunka (levelling) and Just-In-Time manufacturing strategies"
"Shan,_Yang,_Yang,_and_Zhang_(2014)_CITE studied the bullwhip effect in China, finding that bullwhip was gradually being reduced."
"The bullwhip effect persists in most cases ( Croson_&_Donohue,_2005,_2006;_Croson,_Donohue,_Katok,_&_Sterman,_2014;_Nienhaus,_Ziegenbein,_&_Schoensleben,_2006;_Wu_&_Katok,_2006_CITE)."
Sterman_(1989)_CITE understood the order volatility from the perspective of bounded rationality and sub-optimal decisions
"This underweighting does not improve when: the supply line is made visible ( Wu_&_Catok,_2006_CITE); demand is known and stationary ( Croson_&_Donohue,_2006_CITE); or even when demand is known and constant ( Croson_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that some participants choose a positive feedback strategy, ie, they restrain their orders when large stock-outs have built up ( Delhoum_&_Scholz-Reiter,_2009_CITE)."
"Cantor_and_Katok_(2012)_CITE introduced a cost for production and order changes, and found that production is smoothed when demand is seasonal, and that the smoothing behaviour is more eminent when the production change cost is high."
"The question that naturally arises is, if variable production is indeed costly, why does a homo economicus choose to bullwhip? This question was posed by Cachon_et_al._(2007)_CITE, which Sterman_(1989)_CITE explained as an irrational mistake and Lee_et_al._(1997)_CITE as a rational choice."
"In this regard, both Sterman's_(1989)_CITE and Lee_et_al._(1997)_CITE explanations are inadequate since the cost assumptions in both approaches inherently induce amplification"
"Chen,_Dresner,_Ryan,_and_Simchi-Levi_(2000a)_CITE identified that bullwhip is, at least partly, due to the unpredictability of demand, lead-times and the need to forecast future demand"
"The simplest demand model is an independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian white noise process ( Deziel_&_Eilon,_1967_CITE)"
"Demand correlation can be accounted for with auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models ( Box_&_Jenkins,_1970_CITE)"
"It has been shown that positive (negative) correlation in demand increases (mitigates) bullwhip ( Duc,_Luong,_&_Kim,_2008a_CITE) and that there is an auto-regressive parameter with maximal bullwhip for a given lead time ( Babai,_Boylan,_Syntetos,_&_Ali,_2015_CITE)"
"For positive correlation, bullwhip increases with the lead time until it reaches an upper bound ( Luong,_2007_CITE)."
"More complex ARIMA models for demand have also been studied: AR(2), AR( p) ( Luong_&_Pien,_2007_CITE); ARMA(1,1) ( Alwan,_Liu,_&_Yao,_2003_CITE); ARMA(2,2) ( Gaalman_&_Disney,_2009_CITE); and ARMA( p,q) ( Gaalman,_2006_CITE)"
"For non-stationary ARIMA models, since the variance of non-stationary time series is no longer finite, alternative bullwhip measures and approaches have to be adopted eg the variance of production changes ( Graves,_1999;_Miyaoka_&_Hausman,_2004_CITE)"
The bullwhip effect problem under MMFE demand was considered in Chen_and_Lee_(2009)_CITE.
"Chen_et_al._(2000a)_CITE and Duc_et_al._(2008a)_CITE studied the moving average (MA) forecasting method, while Chen,_Ryan,_and_Simchi-Levi_(2000b)_CITE and Dejonckheere,_Disney,_Lambrecht,_and_Towill_(2003)_CITE investigated the simple exponential smoothing (SES) method"
"Therefore, some authors (eg Aviv,_2003_CITE) have adopted the Kalman filter approach"
"The impact of more sophisticated forecasting methods such as Holt's, Brown's and Damped Trend forecasting was discussed by Wright_and_Yuan_(2008)_CITE and Li,_Disney,_and_Gaalman_(2014)_CITE"
Zhang_(2004a)_CITE suggested that MMSE forecasting minimises inventory-related cost
This was supported by Hussain_et_al._(2012)_CITE in a simulation study
"Forrester_(1961)_CITE highlighted that the delays in information and material flow, a.k.a"
"Lee_et_al._(1997)_CITE and Chen_et_al._(2000a)_CITE argued that bullwhip increases in lead-time, as did Steckel,_Gupta,_and_Banerji_(2004)_CITE and Agrawal,_Sengupta,_and_Shanker_(2009)_CITE"
"Over the years others have further discovered that this relationship does not always hold when the demand is auto-correlated ( Luong,_2007_CITE)"
"As for the information delay, some authors have found that delayed demand information reduces the bullwhip effect and can sometimes be good news for upstream suppliers ( Hosoda_&_Disney,_2012;_Miyaoka_&_Hausman,_2004;_Zhang,_2005_CITE)."
"Chatfield,_Kim,_and_Harrison_(2004),_Kim,_Chatfield,_Harrison,_and_Hayya_(2006)_CITE and Duc,_Luong,_and_Kim_(2008b)_CITE showed that order variability increases with lead-time variability, a result that is also supported by the behavioural experiment conducted by Ancarani,_Di_Mauro,_and_D'Urso_(2013)_CITE"
"State-dependent lead-times have been examined by So_and_Zheng_(2003)_CITE and Boute,_Disney,_Lambrecht,_and_Van_Houdt_(2007)_CITE, and both studies found that bullwhip is underestimated if the endogeneity of lead-time is neglected."
Linear ordering policies: Weighted feedback has been used as an active and adjustable control technique long before it was proposed by Sterman_(1989)_CITE to depict the misperception of delays in the Beer Game
The proportional feedback control technique was introduced by Magee_(1956)_CITE and further developed by Deziel_and_Eilon_(1967)_CITE and Towill_(1982)_CITE
"The automatic pipeline, inventory and order-based production control system (APIOBPCS) proposed by John,_Naim,_and_Towill_(1994)_CITE is mathematically equivalent to Sterman's_(1989)_CITE anchoring and adjustment heuristic ."
"When the system is linear and time invariant and the cost function is quadratic, the optimal policy is known to be linear and can be solved with the Riccati equation ( Sethi_&_Thompson,_2000_CITE)"
Deziel_and_Eilon_(1967)_CITE proposed the first linear proportional production control policy where the same feedback parameter is assigned to both the inventory and pipeline levels
"Proportional control has the capability to reduce order variance ( Chen_&_Disney,_2007;_Lin,_Wong,_Jang,_Shieh,_&_Chu,_2004_CITE), at the expense of increased inventory variance and reduced customer service ( Disney_et_al.,_2008;_Hosoda_&_Disney,_2006b;_Jak i _&_Rusjan,_2008_CITE)"
An optimal parameter setting is given by Disney_et_al._(2004)_CITE for the Deziel Eilon model
"General guidance on tuning the feedback parameters is given by Balakrishnan,_Geunes,_and_Pangburn_(2004),_Papanagnou_and_Halikias_(2008)_CITE"
"Graves,_Kletter,_and_Hetzel_(1998)_CITE and Boute_and_Van_Miegham_(2015)_CITE describe other proportional ordering policies."
"This problem has been investigated under ( s,S) ( Caplin,_1985;_Kelle_&_Milne,_1999_CITE), ( Q,T) ( Cachon,_1999;_Lee_et_al.,_1997_CITE) and base stock ( Sucky,_2009_CITE) policies"
"It is found that aggregation in both location and time has a masking effect on the bullwhip effect, ie, bullwhip decreases with the aggregation period but cannot be fully eliminated ( Chen_&_Lee,_2012;_Noblesse,_Boute,_Lambrecht,_&_van_Houdt,_2014_CITE)."
"Lee_and_Whang_(2000)_CITE summarised the common schemes for sharing information on inventory levels, sales data, sales forecast, order status and production/delivery schedules"
Lee_et_al._(1997)_CITE proposed demand information sharing as a countermeasure to the bullwhip effect generated by demand signal processing
"Theoretically, the effectiveness of information sharing in reducing bullwhip has also been demonstrated with: the base stock policy ( Chatfield_et_al.,_2004;_Dejonckheere,_Disney,_Lambrecht,_&_Towill,_2004_CITE); batch ordering ( Hussain_&_Drake,_2011_CITE); correlated demand ( Gaur,_Giloni,_&_Seshadri,_2005;_Lee,_So,_&_Tang,_2000_CITE); price fluctuations ( Gavirneni,_2006;_Ma,_Wang,_Che,_Huang,_&_Xu,_2013_CITE); and in reverse supply chains ( Adenso-D az,_Moreno,_Guti rrez,_&_Lozano,_2012_CITE)"
"Under certain circumstances, order variance increases linearly with information sharing and exponentially without ( Dejonckheere_et_al.,_2004;_Kim_et_al.,_2006_CITE)"
"Several factors influence the potential benefit of information sharing, including demand patterns ( Steckel_et_al.,_2004_CITE) and lead-times"
"For instance, information sharing is more beneficial when demand is highly correlated or highly variable, or when the lead-time is long ( Babai_et_al.,_2015;_Lee_et_al.,_2000_CITE)"
"The direction of information sharing (ie upstream or downstream) also affects its benefit ( Yao_&_Zhu,_2012_CITE)."
"It is believed that VMI removes decision echelons in the supply chain and reduces the risk of information distortion and the amplification effect ( Cannella_&_Ciancimino,_2010;_Disney_&_Towill,_2003;_Xu,_Dong,_&_Evers,_2001_CITE)"
"Dong,_Dresner,_and_Yao_(2014)_CITE presents an empirical study of the benefit of VMI based on item-level data finding that VMI benefits downstream firms by reducing inventory and stock-outs, while upstream firms benefit from bullwhip reduction."
"It has been discovered that if the order quantity is constrained to non-negativity (as opposed to the costless return assumption, Lee_et_al.,_1997_CITE), then highly complex and sophisticated dynamical behaviours can be found in supply chains ( Mosekilde_&_Larsen,_1988_CITE)"
"Moreover, this dynamical complexity is also amplified along the chain, in an effect known as chaos amplification ( Hwarng_&_Xie,_2008_CITE)"
"It is further shown that a single-echelon inventory system with a non-negativity constraint is sufficient to generate such complex phenomenon ( Wang,_Disney,_&_Wang,_2012;_Wang,_Disney,_&_Wang,_2014_CITE)."
"Ouyang_and_Li_(2010)_CITE proposed a general supply network model that allows for transhipment, information sharing, and collaboration; they identified conditions for bullwhip"
Sodhi_and_Tang_(2011)_CITE considered an arborescent supply chain and calls for a need to remove structural complexity in order to reduce bullwhip
"Chatfield_(2013)_CITE challenged the opinion that multi-echelon system can be approximated by cascading two-echelon systems, a.k.a"
"Dominiguez,_Framinan,_and_Cannella_(2014)_CITE compared the bullwhip effect in serial and divergent supply chains under stationary and stepwise demand."
"The bullwhip effect can also be observed in such systems in terms of workload, capacity or backlog ( Anderson_&_Morrice,_2000;_Anderson,_Morrice,_&_Lundeen,_2005_CITE)"
Akkermans_and_Vos_(2003)_CITE measured workload in a major US telecom company
"Akkermans_and_Voss_(2013)_CITE offered two more case studies, one of consumer broadband services and another of glass fibre network services"
Haughton_(2009)_CITE studied the bullwhip effect in logistics carriers service
Lee_et_al._(1997)_CITE adopted a simple model to illustrate this effect
zelkan_and_ akanyildirim_(2009)_CITE studied financial flows in a game theoretical two-echelon supply chain model
"Among these are Zhang_and_Burke_(2011)_CITE, who showed that introducing price fluctuations can either exacerbate or mitigate the bullwhip effect, based on the auto- and mutual-correlation between price and demand"
"Recently Sodhi,_Sodhi,_and_Tang_(2014)_CITE incorporated a discretely distributed stochastic price into the economic order quantity model"
Lee_et_al._(1997)_CITE suggested that price stabilization or everyday low price (EDLP) helps to mitigate this problem
"Some have suggested that EDLP cannot decrease order variability and firms would not choose to reduce bullwhip-induced costs when it jeopardises more important objectives such as market share, total revenue, and service level ( Su_&_Geunes,_2012_CITE)"
Alternatively Gavirneni_(2006)_CITE and Hamister_and_Suresh_(2008)_CITE argued that a fluctuating pricing policy may lower demand volatility and improve profitability
Lee_et_al._(1997)_CITE attempted to explain this effect using a one-supplier-multiple-retailer newsvendor model
"When retailers are local monopolists (that is, when they do not compete for customer demand), the uniform policy is truth-inducing ( Cachon_&_Lariviere,_1999a_CITE)"
"If retailers are not monopolists, then all IR policies, as well as the uniform and lexicographic policies, are not truth-inducing ( Cho_&_Tang,_2014;_Liu,_2012_CITE)"
"Further, when competing retailers have asymmetric market power, competitive allocation eliminates the gaming effect ( Cho_&_Tang,_2014_CITE)."
"There is a rising concern over the environmental impact of production and supply chain systems and increased regulations have made reverse logistics a hot topic for research ( Govindan_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Tang_and_Naim_(2004)_CITE incorporated a remanufacturing process into the APIOBPCS model ( John_et_al.,_1994_CITE)"
Zhou_and_Disney_(2006)_CITE obtained a closed form expression for variance amplification in a closely related remanufacturing model
Adenso-D az_et_al._(2012)_CITE used a Cider Game model to simulate the impact of several factors on the bullwhip in reverse supply chains
"For example, the stochastic yield of a remanufacturing system creates a non-linear system ( Hosoda,_Disney,_&_Gavirneni,_2015_CITE)."
"In terms of cash flow, Tangsucheeva_and_Prabhu_(2013)_CITE and Chen,_Liao,_and_Kuo_(2013)_CITE proposed a financial bullwhip effect , measured by internal liquidity risk (in terms of bond yield spread) and the cash conversion cycle"
"For instance, the term green bullwhip effect is used by Lee,_Klassen,_Furlan,_and_Vinelli_(2014)_CITE for the phenomenon that customer's environmental requirements (in the form of specifications) become tighter and more stringent as they pass upstream"
"Recently, the ideas behind the MPB and XOR DOP generators were extended to create continuous DOPs from any stationary continuous optimization problem [10,26]_CITE."
"The gap between real-world DOPs and academic benchmarks, as some researchers have pointed out [13,19]_CITE, is one of the main problems that should be addressed by researchers in the EDO area"
It is important to remark that the previous definition of single time-dependent DOP ( Definition 4) is different from the definition of single time-dependent systems in [22]_CITE
"Thus, memory-based approaches [7]_CITE, where past solutions are implicitly or explicitly stored and recovered, can be successfully employed"
"For example, in [10]_CITE, the control parameters of the dynamic landscape change in one of six different ways: deterministic small step, deterministic large step, random, chaotic, recurrent, and recurrent with noise."
"As observed in [26]_CITE, in DOPs created by the XOR DOP generator, each individual of the current population is moved to a new position in the fitness landscape before being evaluated, ie, instead of evaluating the fitness of the individual at x, the fitness is evaluated at x m(e)"
"In [27]_CITE, the dynamical system approach [29,15]_CITE was used to analyse the DOPs created by the XOR DOP generator"
"In the dynamic 0 1 knapsack problem, the weights and profits of the items, the total number of items, and the knapsack capacity can change during the optimization process (see [11]_CITE for different variations of the knapsack problem and [20]_CITE for a dynamic benchmark problem based on the dynamic 0 1 knapsack problem)"
"In [28]_CITE, the authors studied the dynamical system of a genetic algorithm (GA) in the dynamic 0 1 knapsack problem where the total number of items is static along the evolutionary optimization process, but the other variables can change"
"This equation describes the modifications in the fitness landscape for other problems too, like the DOPs created by the dynamic environment generator based on problem difficulty [28]_CITE, ie, the fitness landscape modifications in such DOPs have similar dynamics"
"Based on the work of Wilke and Martinetz [30]_CITE, which considered cyclic time-dependent fitness functions generated by replacing the constants c(xi,Y(xi)) with trigonometric functions dependent on the generation index, Eriksson and Olsson [6]_CITE proposed the random dynamics NK-landscapes generator, a DOP generator based on the NK-model that allows to control the severity and frequency of changes"
"In [24]_CITE, another example of single time-dependent DOP ( Definition 4), where the fitness difference b depends on a set of templates (e), is described"
The authors in [8]_CITE proposed a measure of search difficulty for problems where the global optima are known
"One of the criteria used by Branke [2]_CITE to characterize dynamic environments is the severity of change for a dynamic problem, measured by the distance between optimal solutions before and after a change"
"In the dynamical system approach [15,29]_CITE, instead of studying the behaviour of single individuals in the search space, the behaviour of discrete EAs is described by the trajectory of the population in a population space"
"The behaviour of the population for a GA is given by p(t)=Gp(t-1),t, where p(t) is the expected population at generation t N+,G(.,t): N+ is the algorithm generational operator (map) at generation t, and the simplex where the population vector is contained is given by: (54) =p Rn:pk 0,fork=0, ,n-1and k=0n-1pk=1.In the limit N (infinite population case), where N is the population size, the trajectory of the population in the simplex can be deterministically described [15]_CITE, even for DOPs [28]_CITE"
"For a DOP, the metastable states of the GA are modified according to the changes in the problem [28]_CITE"
"The algorithms are: standard GA (SGA), random immigrants GA (RIGA), and GA with hypermutation (HGA) [3]_CITE"
"It does not escape from our perception that, in order to predict the behaviour of the algorithms, the analysis of only the modifications on the fitness vector is not enough, being necessary the investigation of the synergism between the topological structure of the fitness landscape and the neighbourhood relations generated by the operators employed by the optimization algorithm (see, eg, the works [16,21]_CITE)"
"In this way, a very relevant, and essential, future work is the analysis of the behaviour of the state-of-the-art approaches for DOPs [4]_CITE according to the analysis presented here"
"Such changes are associated with modifications in the fitness landscape and are due to various reasons, like faults, environmental changes, platform modification, transfer of solutions from simulation to real environments, cooperation and competition problems, and changes in the strategies or objectives [14]_CITE"
"In [24]_CITE, the dynamical system of a GA employed to optimize the control laws of mobile robots in two applications was investigated"
"This problem is a simplification of the problems investigated in [14,25]_CITE, where EAs are employed to evolve a neural network that controls a mobile robot"
"In [14]_CITE, the modifications in the fitness landscape occur due to changes in the environment where the robot is navigating, while they are produced by intermittent faults in [25]_CITE"
"In [39,55]_CITE, this strategy is called the residual method"
"In the case that the operator F is linear and R is convex, (2) and (3) are basically equivalent, if is chosen according to Morozov discrepancy principle (see [39,_Chap._3]_CITE)."
"While the theory of Tikhonov regularization has received much attention in the literature (see for instance [1,14,21,22,33,37,45,49,52,56,58]_CITE), the same cannot be said about the residual method"
"These problems have been treated in very general settings in [38,51]_CITE (see also [34,54,55]_CITE)"
Convergence rates have been derived in [6]_CITE for linear equations in Hilbert spaces and later generalized in [34]_CITE to non-linear equations in Banach spaces
"Convergence rates have also been derived in [7,9,32]_CITE for the reconstruction of sparse sequences."
"In [21,50]_CITE, where convergence and stability of Tikhonov regularization have been investigated, the stability results are of the following form: for every sequence (yk)k N y and every sequence of minimizers xk argmin{ F(x)-yk 2+ R(x)} there exists a subsequence of (xk)k N that converges to a minimizer of F(x)-y 2+ R(x)"
"If X satisfies the first axiom of countability, then x Lim sup k k, if and only if there exists a subsequence ( kj)j N of ( k)k N and a sequence of elements xj kj such that x j x (see [41,_Section_29.IV]_CITE)"
"Thus also their intersection k NSk= -Limsupk k is non-empty (see [40,_Theorem_5.1]_CITE)."
"Then in particular every compact set is sequentially compact (see [40,_Theorem_5.5]_CITE)"
"Consequently, ( F, y, ) is the intersection of a decreasing family of non-empty -compact sets and thus non-empty (see [40,_Theorem_5.1]_CITE)."
"Moreover, the mapping F is coercive, if its lower level sets are pre-compact, see [4]_CITE"
"Because F has a closed graph, the pre-image under F of every compact set is closed (see [38,_Theorem_4]_CITE)"
"Apart from the more general, topological setting, the main difference to [34,_Lemma_2.2]_CITE is the additional inclusion of operator errors into the result"
"From Proposition 4.3 we now obtain that (xk)k N weakly converges to x and xk pp x pp_ Thus, in fact, the sequence (xk)k N strongly converges to x (see [44,_Corrollory_5.2.19]_CITE)"
"Also in this case, weak convergence and convergence of norms imply the strong convergence of a sequence [44,_Theorem_5.2.18]_CITE"
"More generally, this property is called the Radon Riesz property [44,_p._453]_CITE"
Spaces satisfying this property are also called Efimov Stechkin spaces in [55]_CITE
"The lower semi-continuity of W p has, for instance, been shown in [27]_CITE"
"For Tikhonov regularization, convergence rates have been derived in [3,6,23,36,46,47]_CITE in terms of the Bregman distance"
"To that end, we make use of a generalized notion of convexity, which is not based on the duality between a Banach space X and its dual X but on more general pairings (see [53]_CITE)"
The same notion has recently been used in [29]_CITE for the derivation of convergence rates for non-convex regularization functionals
"In a Banach space setting, the source inequality (30) has already been used in [36,50]_CITE to derive convergence rates for Tikhonov regularization with convex functionals and in [34]_CITE for multiparameter regularization"
"Typically, convergence rates are formulated in a setting which slightly differs from the one of Theorem 5.4, see [6,21,36,50]_CITE"
"Note that every Hilbert space is 2-convex and that there is no Banach space (with dim ( X) 2) that is r-convex for some r < 2 (see [42,_pp._63ff]_CITE)"
"In [60,_Eq._(2.17) ]_CITE it is shown that there exists a constant K > 0 such that (36) x +z r x r+r jr(x ),z X ,X+K z rfor all x , z X and j r( x ) J r( x )"
"By Asplund theorem [13,_Chap._1,_Theorem_4.4]_CITE, the duality mapping J r equals the subgradient of R= r/r"
Exact values for the constant K in (37) (and thus for the constant c in (35)) can be derived from [60]_CITE
Bregman distances satisfying (37) are called r-coercive in [35]_CITE
This r-coercivity has already been applied in [2]_CITE for the minimization of Tikhonov functionals in Banach spaces
"The spaces X = L p( , ) for p (1, 2] and some -finite measure space ( , ) are examples of 2-convex Banach spaces (see [42,_p._81,_Remarks_following_Theorem_1.f.1.]_CITE)"
"The book [50,_pp._70ff]_CITE clarifies the relation between (34) and the source conditions used to derive convergence rates for convex functionals on Banach spaces"
"In a finite dimensional setting with p = 1, the minimization problem (40) has received a lot of attention during the last years under the name of compressed sensing (see [7,8,10,16 18,20,26,57]_CITE)"
"Results for p < 1 can be found in [11,15,25,48]_CITE"
This inverse problems point of view has so far only been treated for the case p = 1 (see [32]_CITE)
"The more general setting has only been considered for Tikhonov regularization Fx-y 2+ Rp(x) min(see [12,14,28,31,43,61]_CITE)"
The functional Rp(x)= |x |p is weakly lower semi-continuous (on 2( )) as the sum of non-negative and weakly continuous functionals (see [19]_CITE)
"The estimate Rp(x) x 2( )p (see [31,_Eq._(5)]_CITE) shows that Rp is weakly coercive"
"For the convex case p 1, it is shown in [31,_Lemma_2]_CITE that the p convergence of a sequence x k already implies Rp(xk-x) 0"
A similar result for 0 < p < 1 has been derived in [30]_CITE
"For p 1, the same type of results ( Propositions 6.5, 6.7) has also been obtained for p -Tikhonov regularization in [31,50]_CITE"
"The results for the non-convex case, p (0, 1), are based on [30]_CITE, where the same rate for non-convex Tikhonov regularization with a priori parameter choice has been derived (see also [29]_CITE)"
"In [61]_CITE, the conditions for the convergence rates result for non-convex regularization are basically the same as in Proposition 6.7, but only a rate of order O( 1/2) has been obtained"
"In [5,28]_CITE, a linear convergence rate O( ) is proven, but with a considerably stronger range condition: each standard basis vector e , , has to satisfy e ran F"
"Theorem 5.4 therefore implies the inequality (42)sup{D Rp(x )(x ,x ):x (F,y, )} ( + Fx -y ).From [31,_Lemma_10]_CITE we obtain the inequality (43) x-x 2( )2 dp3+2Rp(x )+Rp(x)D Rp(x )(x,x )for all x dom(Rp)"
"Since p( ) is 2-convex (see [42]_CITE) and continuously embedded in 2( ), Proposition 5.8 provides an alternative estimate for x x in terms of the stronger distance p( )"
"Moreover it has been shown in [31,_Proof_of_Theorem_14]_CITE that there exists w( x) = c x x p W ( x ) W such that for some 1, 2 > 0 the inequality (44)-w(x)=c x-x p 1(Rp(x)-Rp(x ))+ 2 F(x-x ) holds on (2 , y , F) for small enough"
"The proofs for p = 1 and p (0, 1) are similar; the required estimate (44) has been shown for p = 1 in [31,_Proof_of_Theorem_15]_CITE and for p (0, 1) in [30,_Eq._(7)]_CITE"
"In this special situation, norm convergence has also been shown in [39,_Theorem_3.4.1]_CITE"
"All these estimates hold provided S(F(x ),y) and a source inequality introduced in [36]_CITE is satisfied"
This carries on the result of [6]_CITE for constrained regularization
"This implies increased flow perturbation per row and less space for its damping, which according to Li and He [1,2]_CITE can lead to forcing increments of first order importance"
"In order to tackle this problem, the inherent unsteadiness of the flow field should be taken into consideration in every stage of the design process, as proposed by Hodson et al [3]_CITE."
"Several sources of flow unsteadiness have been identified, with comprehensive accounts found in Paniagua [4]_CITE and Payne [5]_CITE"
"Barter et al [6]_CITE investigated numerically the propagation of shocks across a stage, both considering and neglecting wave reflections between rows"
"However, Kammerer and Abhari [7]_CITE demonstrated experimentally the importance of higher order harmonics."
Vascellari et al [8]_CITE identified numerically the particularities of 2D profile velocity distributions that give rise to the trailing edge shock system
"Joly et al [9]_CITE set as objective the minimisation of vane outlet inhomogeneities using multi-objective optimisation techniques, revealing that efficiency and unsteady forcing are conflicting objectives"
Wang [10]_CITE concluded that the design of a 3D structure cannot be decoupled into 2D subproblems.
The optimisation code currently in use at the von Karman Institute is based on a Multi Objective Differential Evolutionary algorithm developed by Price and Storn [11]_CITE
"Regarding endwall geometry, is was maintained constant and defined as axisymmetric in order to limit the scope of the study, as its contouring noticeably affects the pressure field [10]_CITE."
"The Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes code TRAF, developed by Arnone et al [13]_CITE, uses a Finite Volume spatial discretisation and a Runge Kutta type time integration scheme to march in time towards a steady solution"
"The aerodynamic forcing was computed with a Nonlinear Harmonic Method implemented in the commercial solver NUMECA FINE/Turbo [15]_CITE, by integration of unsteady pressure forces over the vane"
"Bearing in mind that the boundary layer grows with both free stream Mach number and flow acceleration [16]_CITE, this implies an initially pronounced boundary layer growth"
"Kwon et al [12]_CITE also extend the MSD, OSP, SMF and ACEs to their corresponding kernel versions based on the kernel-based learning theory"
Several methods have been developed based on the CEM specifically [13 15]_CITE
"Yang et al [13]_CITE utilise an inequality constraint on the output detector to solve the spectral variability problems, instead of the equal constraint on the CEM"
"A hierarchical structure of CEM [14]_CITE is proposed, which suppresses the backgrounds while preserving the target spectra to boost the performance of CEM"
Sparse representation (SR)-based algorithms have also been applied to the HSI target detection [16 21]_CITE
"Chen et al [16]_CITE propose a sparsity-based target detection (STD), linearly modelling a test pixel by the training background samples and the training target samples"
"Zhang et al [17]_CITE propose an SR-based binary hypothesis model (SRBBH), which is in the similar fashion of the binary hypothesis model of the MSD"
"The kernel versions of the STD and SRBBH can be found in [18]_CITE and [19]_CITE, respectively"
"As explained in [22]_CITE and as usually the case, we can relax both constraints in target detection."
"To cope with multiple scattering problems and to model interaction effects, the bilinear mixing model (BMM) has been proposed in the hyperspectral analysis, particularly for the unmixing applications [23 28]_CITE"
"Nascimento et al [23]_CITE and Fan et al [24]_CITE address the HSI unmixing problem by taking into account of the second-order scattering interaction between endmembers, referred to as Nascimento model and Fan model hereafter, respectively"
Halimi et al [25]_CITE propose a generalised bilinear model (GBM) to unmix an HSI pixel and solve the problem by a hierarchical Bayesian algorithm
"Practical analysis [26 28]_CITE also demonstrate impacts of different orders of interactions in real HSI mixing problems, such as tree cover estimates in orchards"
"On top of the BMM, Heylen et al [29]_CITE derive a multilinear mixing model (MLM) which extends the BMM to an infinite orders of interactions"
"Using the generalised likelihood ratio test (GLRT) [3]_CITE, the output detector of the MSD model is given by (5)DMSD(x)=xTPB xxTPV x H0H1 ,where PB =I PB with PB=B(BTB) 1BT being the projection matrix onto the column space of B; and PV =I PV with PV=V(VTV) 1VT being the projection matrix onto the column space of V, where V is a p (rt+rb) concatenated matrix of T and B, ie V=[T,B]."
The BMM has been introduced in the hyperspectral unmixing problems to accounts for the presence of multiple photon interactions [23 28]_CITE
"To this end, the bilinear model (BMM) [23 28]_CITE is proposed to model interaction effects of each pair of endmembers, so as to take account of the multiple scattering phenomena"
"A typical BMM called Fan model [24]_CITE is given by (8)x=Ma+ i=1K 1 j=i+1K i,jmi mj+n,where denotes the element-wise product operation between two vectors"
"In the Fan model [24]_CITE, it is assumed that k=1Kak=1 and i,j=aiaj, whereas in the Nascimento model [23]_CITE, the sum-to-one constraint is based on k=1Kak+ i=1K 1 j=i+1K i,j=1"
"Again with the explanations in the HSI target detection [22]_CITE, we will relax the sum-to-one constraint as well as the non-negative constraint in the following proposed method to simplify the solution to target detection problems."
"Similarly to the explanation of the model used for unmixing of HSIs [25]_CITE, for example, we assume that there are only two components trees and vehicle presented in an observed target pixel, where the vehicle is the target to be detected and trees are backgrounds"
"However, as with the analysis of unmixing of HSI [25 28]_CITE, these higher order terms can be neglected."
"This image is published by Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), Rochester, NY, USA [32]_CITE"
"Thy Hymap dataset serves as standard target detection dataset and is widely used, such as in [21,30,31,33,34]_CITE."
"As with [31]_CITE, the spectrum of the target almandine is rescaled and resampled to match the AVIRIS image wavelength"
"Such a sub-image setting has been widely used and well accepted by researchers, such as in [21,35,36]_CITE"
"Different experimental settings for analysing the Hymap image can also be found in [13,15,30,31,33,34]_CITE for different illustrative purposes."
The spectrum of each desired target (F1-F4 and V1-V3) is provided by projected-equipped SPL files [32]_CITE
"As with [31]_CITE, we rescale and resample the SPL spectra according to the Hymap HSI wavelength"
"As explained in [37]_CITE, the statistics of background can be estimated by all pixels within the area of interest when detectors are applied in a sparse target environment"
"In this paper, the STD method is solved by a greedy algorithm called orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) [38]_CITE."
"We should note that each target deployed in the scene has an ROI [32]_CITE, which means that the target may appear in any coordinates within the ROI"
"As with Zhang et al [31,36]_CITE, we use the false alarm rate (FAR) to measure the detection performances of the compared methods"
"Hence as with most published works of HSI target detections conducted on the Hymap dataset such as [31,33,34]_CITE, the parameter of each detector is manually tuned to show the optimal performance of the algorithms for illustrative purposes"
"(For alternative approaches that avoid the task of initially generating all the efficient solutions cf., eg, [29,69]_CITE.) Various interactive procedures may be used for this purpose"
"Applications have been reported from various fields such as information technology management [45]_CITE, research and development management [54]_CITE, radiation therapy treatment planning [20]_CITE, strategic technology planning in hospital management [21]_CITE, and municipal wastewater treatment [23]_CITE."
"So far, only few studies have examined user behavior during interactive, aspiration-based search [9,10,63]_CITE"
"Consequently, many empirical studies (eg, [51]_CITE) use criteria such as confidence or perceived quality of a solution"
"Similar retest methods are quite often used to evaluate preference elicitation methods [22,24]_CITE."
"In essence, heatmaps are matrices in which the cells are colored according to their values [15]_CITE"
"The use of (clustered) heatmaps for visualization originated in data mining, particularly in molecular biology and clinical applications (eg, [67]_CITE)"
More recently their use as a means for visualizing the Pareto frontier was proposed by Pyrke et al [47]_CITE and Lotov and Miettinen [38]_CITE.
Parallel coordinate plots [26]_CITE have been chosen as a fundamentally different third problem presentation because they can display several criteria without drastically increasing the complexity of the display or the cognitive burden on the DM
"Users of information technology search for a cognitive trade-off between the perceived effort of using a technology and its perceived usefulness and accuracy [16,61]_CITE"
"Prior experience enables DMs to use stable heuristics that require less effort [40,62]_CITE"
DMs that experience more effort perceive the results as less accurate [1]_CITE
"Accuracy of decisions is strongly related to decision quality that is typically linked to confidence in the decision [27,51,58]_CITE."
"Task complexity is defined as the cognitive burden placed on the DM and results from the number of criteria and alternatives involved [11,68]_CITE"
"This in turn leads to lower confidence in the solution [8,41,55]_CITE"
"Moreover, decisional conflict and perceived effort are negatively related to users' attitudes toward the system [1,12]_CITE"
"However, effort is also positively related to decision quality, which increases decision confidence and consequently perceived usefulness of the system [27]_CITE."
"In addition to the task-technology fit, recent research highlights the importance of DMs' cognitive characteristics [36]_CITE"
"It is defined as a stable learned habitual response pattern based on cognitive abilities used in decision situations [49,56]_CITE"
"Scott and Bruce [49]_CITE define five behavioral dimensions based on DMs' self-evaluation: (i) a rational, (ii) an intuitive, (iii) a dependent, (iv) an avoidant, and (v) a spontaneous style"
"Studies have shown that even though an individual may have a predominant style, decision styles are not mutually exclusive [37,53,56]_CITE."
"Empirical research contends that gender has no influence on the preferred decision making style [37,53]_CITE"
"Similarly, recent research indicates that gender differences in adoption and use of technology do not exist anymore for younger subjects [44]_CITE"
"Understanding of concepts consists of three components: DMs first have to develop connections between internal mental structures (building), then reach the state of having these connections available at a given time (having), and finally to use the connections to solve a problem or construct a response to a question (enacting) [18]_CITE"
"A DM understanding a concept should be able to see its deeper characteristics, look for specific information more quickly, draw analogies, or put it in simpler terms [3,46]_CITE."
"In one of the earliest studies about the impact of information representation on ex-post tests, tables were found to provide best support for the recall of specific values [42,65]_CITE"
"In contrast, Umanath and Scamell [58]_CITE report that using graphs provides better support than tables for recall tasks that involve pattern recognition"
Watson and Driver [66]_CITE examined the impact of three-dimensional graphics and tables on subjects' performance in immediate and ex-post evaluation
"Subjective measures represent evaluations of the decision process, its outcomes, and the system in general [63]_CITE"
"Moreover, we have taken into account several factors regarding the external validity of our results [35]_CITE"
"However, prior research has shown that time pressure in this interactive phase is indeed an important factor for assessing different representation formats [6]_CITE as well as decision making strategies [2,48]_CITE, and therefore could also make a difference compared to the setting studied here."
Instead many inhalation devices now use hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)-based propellants which interact minimally with the surfaces of the chamber and the seals because of its inert nature [1]_CITE
Muskhelishvili [4]_CITE solved the first and second fundamental problems of a circular disk (o-ring cross section) under concentrated forces applied to its boundary (based on the works of Michell [5]_CITE and Love [6]_CITE)
Lindley [7]_CITE investigated the load-compression characteristics of toroidal elastomeric seals
"However, George et al [8]_CITE showed that as strain levels increased, progressively the results of Lindley approach underestimated the extent of deformation"
"In George et al [8]_CITE an FEA approach was undertaken, which showed no discernible difference with the basic analytical approach of Lindley [7]_CITE until the seal compressive strain exceeded 20% of its cross-sectional depth."
Dragoni and Strozzi [9]_CITE reviewed the case of a laterally restrained o-ring within a rectangular groove under compressive loads
"Green and English [10,11]_CITE expanded the work of Lindley [7]_CITE and that of Dragoni and Strozzi [9]_CITE, using FEA for examination of a seal under differing regional contact stresses"
"The problem of o-ring sealing and deformation was recently revisited by Kim et al [12]_CITE, using a mixture of experimental verification and FEA, coupled with the original approach of Lindley [7]_CITE"
"Karaszkiewicz [13 15]_CITE investigated the hydrodynamic lubrication of elastomeric o-ring seals, assuming Hertzian contact between the seal and its retaining groove"
He noted agreement between his simple hybrid approach and the FEA work of George et al [8]_CITE
"With the evaluated load and an assumed speed of entraining motion, he employed Hamrock and Dowson [16]_CITE extrapolated oil film thickness equation for line contact geometry under soft elastohydrodynamic conditions to predict the lubricant film thickness, allowing for an assumed leakage rate [15]_CITE"
Grimble et al [2]_CITE showed that the predominant regime of lubrication for pharmaceutical seals is boundary
"Using a friction model, based on the work of Greenwood and Tripp [17]_CITE, Grimble et al [2]_CITE obtained an estimate of the hysteretic losses in cyclic actuation and release of an inhaler valve"
"In fact, a detailed characterisation of rough inhaler valve seal surfaces, followed by an analytical model combining viscous friction of a drug formulation, asperity adhesive and deformation frictions by Prokopovich et al [18]_CITE for other variants of inhaler valves confirmed the overall findings of Grimble et al [2]_CITE"
"With wet seals, Karaszkiewicz [15]_CITE, Grimble et al [2]_CITE, and Prokopovich et al [18]_CITE used the aforementioned extrapolated oil film thickness equation of Hamrock and Dowson [16]_CITE to predict the thickness of any lubricant film"
"For example, Hooke et al [19]_CITE incorporated lubrication without the need to resort to a full FEA model for an isotropic elastic o-ring seal in a radial sealing orientation"
This was achieved through evaluation of elastic distortion of a circular cross-section with the seal deflection obtained using the general elasticity theory as outlined by Milne-Thomson [20]_CITE
"This approach assumed a plane strain simplification, similar to that of Lindley [7]_CITE"
"ng n et al [21]_CITE described an axi-symmetric FEA model, the predictions of which showed a prevalent mixed regime of lubrication in o-ring seal conjunctions with hydraulic fluids"
Stupkiewicz and Marciniszyn [22]_CITE considered a hyperelastic (Mooney Rivlin) FEA model to represent the seal deformation behaviour under load
"The soft mixed-elastohydrodynamic approach has also been applied to alternative sealing geometries, such as rotary lip seals [23]_CITE, while Ruskell [24]_CITE showed that rectangular seals form appreciably thinner films than the o-rings."
"The behaviour of reciprocating seals with rectangular cross sections, typical of seals in some drug delivery devices, has also been studied in hydraulic actuators under relatively high loads [25,26]_CITE"
"This is a poignant problem as the propellant, constituting 99% of most formulations [3]_CITE also effectively acts as the bio-compatible lubricant, with very poor viscosity in the range 0.15 0.5 mPa (over a temperature range of 50 C to +60 C)."
"When two equal and opposite forces P (per unit computation element width) act at points Z 1 and Z 2, parallel to the Oz axis as shown in Fig_2 , then Muskhelishvili [4]_CITE showed that the principle of superposition may be used to determine the induced stresses at any point Z within the disc as: (2) z=2P cos3a1r1+cos3a2r2-P Rcosb, y=2P sin2a1 cosa1r1+sin2a2 cosa2r2-P Rcosb, zy=-2P sina1 cos2a1r1-sina2 cos2a2r2."
"If non-uniform regional loading is to be considered, such as that proposed by Green and English [10,11]_CITE, then ( P is replaced by Pj and becomes a part of the summation process"
"This is an initial uniform elastic line contact Hertzian pressure distribution across the seal face-width, with no edge stress discontinuity [28]_CITE"
"Thus, the assumption of an elliptical Hertzian pressure profile made by Karaszkiewicz [13 15]_CITE is not appropriate"
The above values are within the limits which permit the use of linear elasticity as shown by Nikas and Sayles [25]_CITE and Kim et al [12]_CITE.
"These findings conform well with in-field observations and experimental tests reported by Grimble et al [2]_CITE, where surface roughness was taken into consideration"
They are also in accord with the findings of Stupkiewicz and Marciniszyn [22]_CITE that a coherent film is not formed unless elastohydrodynamic conditions are fully developed.
"Karaszkiewicz [14,15]_CITE, as well as Grimble et al [2]_CITE used Hamrock and Dowson [16]_CITE equation for an EHL line contact of materials of low moduli: (25)H=4.4U 0.65W -0.21."
Fig_8 shows the predicted conditions plotted in the Greenwood Chart [30]_CITE
"Gohar and Rahnejat [28]_CITE show that this exponent is in the range 0.68 0.7 for hard EHL conjunctions, which is slightly reduced to 0.65 [16]_CITE under iso-viscous elastic conditions"
"Therefore, the more detailed analysis here compared with the empirical approach highlighted by Karaszkiewicz [14,15]_CITE indicates thinner predicted lubricant films under the same operating conditions"
"The analysis carried out corroborates the assumption made based on the predominance of boundary regime of lubrication, as noted by Grimble et al [2]_CITE and Prokopovich et al [18]_CITE"
"Therefore, the work presented indicates thinner predicted lubricant films compared with the empirical approach highlighted by Karaszkiewicz [14,15]_CITE under the same operating conditions."
"Silicone oil is quite sensitive to shear rate, acting rather like a gel; in solid state at low shear and as liquid lubricant while the shear rate is increased [31]_CITE"

"The mathematical formalism which has been developed for incorporating geometric and topological techniques deals with point clouds, ie finite sets of points equipped with proximity or nearness or distance functions [3,4]_CITE"
It then adapts tools from the various branches of geometry and topology for the study of point clouds [5]_CITE
Geometrical and Topological methods are tools for analysing highly complex data [3]_CITE
"The idea of constructing summaries of entire domains of parameter values involves understanding the relationship between geometric objects constructed from data using various parameter values, eg [8]_CITE."
"In many cases, the data to be examined is often based on shapes that are not easy to capture using traditional methods [9]_CITE."
We face a wave of data; the amount of data is so big that a lot of information is never looked at by anybody [18]_CITE
"The next problematic aspect of data is that a big part of it is redundant, eg one video due to many existing video formats, its resolution and subtitles in many languages [19]_CITE takes up lots of space, which is necessary from an informational point of view but generally it does not bring anything new"
"The manner in which data is stored has changed: what was sufficient in 1965, when the US Government decided to found the first data centre to store 175 million sets of fingerprints and 742 million tax returns and store data onto magnetic computer tape [20]_CITE, is nowadays unusable"
"The trend is to replace HDDs with solid-state drives (SSD) as a type of non-volatile memory (NVM) [22,23]_CITE"
These will be integrated as byte/addressable memory on a memory bus or stacked directly on a chip (3D-stacking) [24]_CITE
"All existing storage architectures, such as storage area networks (SAN), network-attached storage (NAS) and direct-attached storage (DAS), were ordinarily used before large-scale distributed systems were required and the aforementioned architectures met their limitations [22,23]_CITE."
"Users do not have time and do not want to maintain data storage and computing hardware, so the easiest way is to send data to the cloud [25]_CITE"
"However, this modern technology also has its limits the volume of communication capacity and security [26,23]_CITE"
"SQL is more reliable, and straightforward and analytic platforms such as Cloudera Impala and SQLstream run on it [23]_CITE"
"Moreover, recently, the Not Only SQL (NoSQL) database approach is often used in order to avoid using the Relation Database Management System (RDBMS) [27]_CITE"
"The most popular management systems using NoSQL databases are Hbase, Apache Cassandra, SimpleDB, Google BigTable, Apache Hadoop, MapReduce, MemchaceDB and Voldemort [23]_CITE."

"Persistent homology for data analysis has been studied by many researchers in mathematics and computer science, eg Carlsson [3]_CITE, Edelsbrunner and Harer [39]_CITE, Ghrist [57]_CITE, Oudot [46]_CITE and Zomorodian [58,37]_CITE."
An essential part of Big Data processing is the need for different types of users to apply visualizations [59 61]_CITE to understand a result of Big Data processing
Developing a theory for very large networks is a significant challenge in Big Data research [62]_CITE
"In mathematical science, homology is a general procedure to associate a sequence of abelian groups or modules to a given topological space and/or manifold [39,63]_CITE"
Persistent homology creates a multiscale representation of topological structures via a scale parameter relevant to topological events [65 68]_CITE
"Persistent homology, by its nature, when compared to traditional computational topology [70 72]_CITE and/or computational homology (which results in truly metric-free or coordinate-free representations), exhibits one additional dimension the filtration parameter"
"For the visualization of topological persistence [73]_CITE, a Barcode representation has been proposed, in which various horizontal line segments or bars are used to interpret the persistence of the topological features."
"Efficient computational algorithms, such as the pairing algorithm [74,75]_CITE, Smith normal form [39,68]_CITE and Morse reduction [65,76,77]_CITE, have been proposed to track topological variations during the filtration process [78,72]_CITE"
"Some of these persistent homology algorithms have been implemented in many software packages, namely Perseus [53]_CITE, JavaPlex [55]_CITE and Dionysus [56]_CITE"
"In the past few years, persistent homology has been applied to image analysis [80]_CITE, image retrieval [81]_CITE, chaotic dynamics verification [64]_CITE, sensor networks [82]_CITE, complex networks [83]_CITE, data analysis [3,84 86]_CITE, computer vision [87,88]_CITE, shape recognition [89]_CITE and computational biology [90]_CITE."
The input is molecular simulation data using the replica-exchange molecular dynamics method [95]_CITE
"In recent years, this area has gained much attention, thanks to the development of nonlinear spectral dimensionality reduction methods, often referred to as manifold learning algorithms, see [99]_CITE."
"Information visualization is a broad research area that aims to aid users in exploring, understanding, and analysing data through progressive, iterative visual exploration [101]_CITE"
"With the boom in Big Data and deep data analytics, visualization is being widely used in a variety of data analysis applications [102,103]_CITE"
The connection between dimensionality reduction techniques and visual Big Data will introduce huge opportunities as well as challenges to the community interested in this area [17]_CITE.
"Dimensionality reduction techniques are based on assignment of high-dimensionality space to lower and, ideally, to low-dimensional space (3D, 2D) to be better able to visualize data ( Fig_6 ) and to solve a fundamental problem in a variety of data analysis tasks to find an appropriate representation for the given data, see [104]_CITE"
"From linear dimensionality reduction techniques this can be named Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Canonical Correlations Analysis (CCA), Maximum Autocorrelation Factors (MAF), Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction (SDR), Locality Preserving Projection (LPP), Under complete Independent Component Analysis (UICA), Probabilistic PCA (PPCA), Factor Analysis (FA), Linear Regression (LR), or Distance Metric Learning (DML) [105 108]_CITE."
A strategic initiative called Industrie 4.0 (Industry 4.0) has been proposed and adopted by the German government as a part of the High-Tech Strategy 2020 Action Plan [114]_CITE
"Similar strategies have also been proposed by other main industrial countries, eg, Industrial Internet [115]_CITE by the USA and Internet+ [116]_CITE by China"
The smart factory is characterized by a self-organized multi-agent system [117]_CITE supported with Big Data based feedback and coordination.
"The Industry 4.0 describes a CPS oriented production system [118 121]_CITE that integrates production facilities, warehousing systems, logistics, and even social requirements to establish the global value creation networks [122]_CITE"
"Big data and cloud computing for Industry 4.0 are viewed as data services that utilize the data generated in Industry 4.0 implementations but are not independent as Industry 4.0 components [123,124]_CITE"
"To resolve these issues, understanding of this massive amount of data, advanced visualization and data exploration techniques are critical [125]_CITE."
"Operator DC has been studied, for example, in [5,14,16,22,23,26,38,42,46]_CITE"
In [29]_CITE Sharma studied the following two operators from Bergman spaces to Bloch type spaces: DM C f(z)= (z)f( (z))+ (z) (z)f ( (z))and DC M f(z)= (z) ( (z))f( (z))+ ( (z)) (z)f ( (z))for z D and f H(D)
"In [53,54]_CITE these operators on weighted Bergman spaces were also studied by Stevi , Sharma and Bhat"
"Quite recently, the present author has considered the product-type operator DW , from weighted Bergman space to weighted Zygmund space in [6]_CITE"
"For some other product-type operators, see, for example, [8,18 21,34 36,40,41,43,45,47,48,50,52,56]_CITE and the references therein"
Next we are ready to introduce the needed spaces and some facts in [27]_CITE
"From Zygmund theorem (see Theorem 5.3 in [4]_CITE), we know that f Z if and only if f is continuous on D and f(ei( +h))+f(ei( -h))-2f(ei )h For a good source of the above three spaces, we refer to [57]_CITE"
"For such spaces on the unit disk, the upper half plane, the unit polydisk, the unit ball and some concrete operators on them also see, eg [13,24,30,33,37]_CITE and the references therein"
"For the first, see Lemma 2.4 in [27]_CITE"
"Since A p is a subspace of A p, by the integral representation for functions in A p, we have that for every f A p and z D (see, eg Theorem 2.2 in [57]_CITE) (1)f(z)= Df(w)(1-w z) +2dA (w)"
"By the fact (see, eg Theorem 1.12 in [57]_CITE) that (3)1(1-|z|2)n D(1-|w|2) |1-w z| +n+2dA(w),there is a positive constant c1 such that (4)c1(1-|z|2)n|1-w z| +n+2dA (w)is a probability measure"
"Since (t)/t is nondecreasing on [0, ), when |g(z)| 1, it follows that (t|g(z)|)t|g(z)| (t)t,which gives I= {z D:|g(z)| 1} -1C1-|w|2 +2|g(z)|pdA (z) {z D:|g(z)| 1} -1C1-|w|2 +2|g(z)|pdA (z) C +2 D(1-|w|2) +pt+2|1-w z|2( +2)+ptdA (z) 1,where we use Theorem 1.12 in [57]_CITE"
"Under this assumption, A p is a complete metric space (see, for example, [27]_CITE)"
"In the proof of Theorem 3.1, we have obtained that Z and J1,J2,J3 By Lemma 2.4, we know that the sequence {fn}n N is uniformly bounded in A p_From the proof of Theorem 3.6 in [27]_CITE, it follows that the sequence {fn}n N uniformly converges to zero on any compact subset of D as n"
"For a good source of the above three spaces, we refer to [57]_CITE"
"By Lemma 2.4, we know that the sequence {fn}n N is uniformly bounded in A p_From the proof of Theorem 3.6 in [27]_CITE, it follows that the sequence {fn}n N uniformly converges to zero on any compact subset of D as n"
"Many companies executed the whole test suite to ensure the quality of their software ( Onoma_et_al.,_1998_CITE)"
"Moreover, each nightly build of many open-source software projects such as MySQL ( MySQL,_2013_CITE) and FireFox ( FireFox,_2013_CITE) always apply the whole test suite to verify the version built."
"If the time spent to complete the execution of a program over an individual test case is non-trivial, the time cost to execute the whole test suite T may be large ( Jiang_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"For instance, profiling an execution trace of a C/C++ program at the memory access level using a pintool may easily incur tens to one hundred fold of slowdown ( Luk_et_al.,_2005_CITE)"
"A vast majority of existing test case prioritization research studies ( Yoo_and_Harman,_2012_CITE) propose to collect data from the executions of a previous version (denoted by Q) of P over a test suite T old to guide the prioritization on T"
"Numerous types of such data (such as the fault history ( Kim_and_Porter,_2002_CITE), the change history ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2004_CITE), and the execution profiles ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002_CITE)) obtained from these executions of Q have been empirically evaluated in diverse contexts with respect to the differences in their effects on regression testing results towards the selected goal G of regression testing techniques"
"A recent trend is to replace the rate of fault detection by the rate of program element coverage ( Li_et_al.,_2007_CITE) or to incorporate the results of change impact analysis ( Li_et_al.,_2013_CITE) in their problem or solution formulations"
Elbaum_et_al._(2002_CITE) described the test case prioritization problem as follows:
"Moreover, a goal g, such as the rate of code coverage ( Li_et_al.,_2007_CITE), can be measurable before the execution of P over the prioritized test suite T"
"There are however other types of goals, such as the rate of fault detection ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002_CITE), which cannot be measured directly before the execution of the test cases"
"Moreover, if either a test case reduction/selection technique ( Do_et_al.,_2008;_Yoo_and_Harman,_2012_CITE) or an impact analysis technique ( Li_et_al.,_2013_CITE) has been applied on T old to construct a proper subset T old of T old and the test cases in T old\ T old have not been executed by Q, we have Q( T old ) Q( T old)"
"For instances, the execution profile data are seldom maintained in the repositories of real-world software development projects such as MySQL ( MySQL,_2013_CITE), Eclipse ( Eclipse,_2013_CITE), and FireFox ( FireFox,_2013_CITE)"
"In many projects, such as numerous Android applications (eg, Foursquared ( Foursquared,_2012_CITE)) available in Google Code ( Google_Code,_2013_CITE), their bug repositories only keep few bug reports."
"Take GNU flex ( Flex,_2013_CITE) as an example"
"Impact analysis ( Lahiri_et_al.,_2010;_Li_et_al.,_2013;_Rovegard_et_al.,_2008_CITE) has a potential to precisely identify the change in between P and Q"
"Such impact analyses may be safe under certain conditions ( Rothermel_and_Harrold,_1997_CITE)"
"In this case, linguistic data from each test case (eg, comment, string literal) in T can be extracted to guide the prioritization process that maximizes the average distance from the already-prioritized test cases ( Thomas_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"The distribution of real world coordinates of points-of-interest in the expected outputs and inputs of test cases in T have been proposed to prioritize test cases in T ( Zhai_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"The Greedy algorithms studied in our experiment include the total statement technique and the additional statement technique ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002_CITE)"
"The 2-Optimal algorithm (2-Opti) ( Lin,_1965_CITE; Skiena,_1998_CITE) is another typical greedy algorithm for test case prioritization"
"We evaluated the steepest ascent hill climbing algorithm (Hill) ( Li_et_al.,_2007_CITE) for test case prioritization"
"Genetic Algorithm (GA) ( Holland,_1975_CITE) is a class of adaptive search techniques based on the processes of natural genetic selection"
"Note that this strategy has not been developed by previous work ( Carlson_et_al.,_2011;_Jiang_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Chen_et_al._(2004_CITE) has shown that this simple strategy only ensures the test cases to be far away from each other, but cannot ensure the input domain to have the same density of test cases."
"Discrepancy in Chen_et_al._(2007)_CITE is defined as follows: given domain D and D 1, D 2, , Dm donate m rectangular sub-domains of D whose location and size are randomly defined; and given E represents the set of all test cases and Ei are the sets of test cases whose input is within domain Di where 1 i m"
"When testing command line applications like sed, we can use the string edit distance ( Gusfield,_1997_CITE) to measure their distance."
"The most closely related work of LBS is the adaptive random test case prioritization (ART) ( Jiang_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"We recall that adaptive random testing ( Chen_et_al.,_2004_CITE) is a test case generation technique that makes use of the input information, spreading test cases as evenly as possible across the input domain"
"If the extra time cost of adaptive random testing for test case generation is neither negligible ( Arcuri_and_Briand,_2011;_Chen_et_al.,_2004_CITE) nor controllable, then RT may be able to reveal the first failure of each fault faster (in terms of the total amount of time spent so far) than adaptive random testing for test case generation ( Chen_et_al.,_2004_CITE)."
"The work of Jiang et al ( Jiang_et_al.,_2011_CITE) contributes to extend adaptive random testing for test case generation to the domain of test case prioritization for regression testing, where the test cases have been generated and the size of a test suite is often limited"
The same implementations for the greedy algorithms have been used to report the findings presented in Jiang_et_al._(2009_CITE).
We did not compare with those black-box input-based test case prioritization techniques such as Ledru_et_al._(2011_CITE) and Thomas_et_al._(2014_CITE) because of two reasons
"We used APFD to measure the rate of fault detection ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002_CITE)"
"Since the theoretical optimal prioritization result reported in ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002_CITE) is around 0.99, the LBS techniques are only 4% away from the optimal prioritization in terms of APFD."
"For example, the Hamming distance evaluated in ( Ledru_et_al.,_2011_CITE) was proposed by Hamming for binary tuples, but was generalized to cover tuples of the form < field 1, field 2, , fieldu> such that the number of possible values in each fieldi is finite"
We note that similar practice is also reported in Thomas_et_al._(2014_CITE).
"Similar to previous work ( Elbaum_et_al.,_2002;_Ledru_et_al.,_2011;_Thomas_et_al.,_2014_CITE), we used APFD to evaluate test case prioritization techniques"
"If readers are interest in the rate of code coverage, readers may examine how fast the code coverage has grown through the metric APSC ( Li_et_al.,_2007_CITE)"
"For test set distance, we choose to maximize the minimum distance between a candidate test case and the set of already selected test cases, because this choice is best among all options ( Jiang_et_al.,_2009_CITE)."
Mei_et_al._(2015a)_CITE collected the interaction messages of a service and used the tag information on these messages to prioritize a regression test suite for the service
Zhai_et_al._(2014)_CITE used the geo-location data in the inputs and the outputs of the test cases to assure location-based services
"Mei_et_al._(2012)_CITE proposed a static approach to prioritizing JUnit test case, which analyzes the static call graphs of JUnit test cases and the program under test to estimate the ability of each test case to achieve code coverage, and then prioritize the test cases based on the estimation"
Hao_et_al._(2013_CITE) proposed a test case prioritization technique that dynamically prioritizes the test cases by consulting the execution output of the already prioritized test cases
"In (2011)_CITE, Ledru et al also proposed a static black-box test case prioritization algorithm to maximize test case diversity"
Jiang_et_al._(2009_CITE) proposed code coverage based adaptive random test case prioritization
"Compared to the result reported in Jiang_et_al._(2009_CITE), the result of our input-based LBS techniques is not different in a statistically meaningful way from their code coverage based techniques"
"Zhou_(2010_CITE) proposed to use coverage information to guide test case selection in ART, his work is similar to Jiang_et_al._(2009_CITE) except that it uses the Manhattan distance to measure the distance between test cases."
Wong_et_al._(1997_CITE) combined test suite minimization and prioritization techniques to select cases based on the cost per additional coverage
Walcott_et_al._(2006_CITE) used GAs to reorder test cases under time constraints such that their techniques can be time-aware
"Zhang_et_al._(2009_CITE) used the integer linear programming technique to find an optimal coverage solution, which can lead to effective test case prioritization results"
Srivastava_and_Thiagarajan_(2002_CITE) proposed a binary matching technique to compute the changes between program versions at the basic block level and prioritize test cases to cover greedily the affected program changes
Kim_and_Porter_(2002_CITE) proposed a history-based test case prioritization technique for regression testing in resource constrained environments
Li_et_al._(2007)_CITE empirically evaluated various search-based algorithms for test case prioritization in a systematic way
You_et_al._(2011)_CITE evaluated time-aware test case prioritization on the Siemens suite and the program space
Qu_et_al._(2007)_CITE proposed to group test cases according to their failure-exposing history and to adjust their priority dynamically during executions
"We also conjecture that the limitations of ART mentioning in Arcuri_and_Briand_(2011)_CITE are no longer applicable in Arcuri_et_al._(2012)_CITE because unlike the former work, the latter work is no longer referencing ART ( Chen_et_al.,_2004_CITE)"
Some variants of MLLR have been used to cope with the large amount of adaptation data required to estimate the transformation matrices [7]_CITE
"However, since it does not take into account actual noise corruption process, its performance is generally lower than the model adaptation methods such as parallel model combination (PMC) and VTS adaptation [3,4]_CITE that consider explicitly the relationship between clean and noisy speech signal."
Joint uncertainty decoding (JUD) adapts HMM parameters by explicitly modeling the joint probability density function (PDF) of noisy and clean speech signal [8]_CITE
"As a different point of view from the model adaptation approaches for noise robust speech recognition, training HMMs directly with noisy speech has been proposed to show very promising results in noisy speech recognition [9 11]_CITE"
"For example, in the multi-condition training (MTR) method, noisy speech signals under various noise conditions are collected to train one set of HMMs [9]_CITE"
"Also, multiple HMM sets corresponding to various noise types and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values are constructed during training in a multiple-model based speech recognition (MMSR) framework [10]_CITE"
"In our previous study, the nonlinear relation between the test and training noisy speech in the log-spectrum domain was used to re-estimate the test noisy speech feature vector to make it match better with the noisy speech trained HMM [14]_CITE"
"In recent studies, VTS and JUD based approaches have been popularly used in the feature and model compensation for the noisy speech trained HMM [15 17]_CITE"
"For example, in [15]_CITE, an MTR trained HMM is transformed into a pseudo-clean HMM during training by using VTS"
"Compared with the recent model adaptation methods which adapt the pseudo clean speech HMM, the proposed algorithm is relatively simple in its implementation since it does not require estimate the parameters of the pseudo clean speech HMM [15]_CITE"
"(4) is expanded using a first-order VTS [18]_CITE around the initial value { yTr,0, n,0,h0} of { y Tr, n, h} as follows: (6)y yTr,0+h0+g( yTr,0, n,0,h0,nTr)+GyTr(yTr yTr,0)+Gn(n n,0)+Gh(h h0)where GyTr, G h and G n are the Jacobians of ( 4) with respect to y Tr, h and n, respectively, which will be explained in more detail in the following."
"The first is entitled FE, which consists of 13th order Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) with the 0th cepstral coefficient along with their delta and acceleration coefficients to construct a 39-dimensional feature vector for each frame [20]_CITE"
"The second feature set is a noise robust version of the FE, which is generally called AFE (Advanced Front-End) in the literature and known to significantly reduce word error rates in noisy conditions [21]_CITE"
"The acoustic models were trained using both the Complex Back End (CBE) and Simple Back End (SBE) scripts [10]_CITE, which are each separately defined for the Aurora 2 database"
"When the joint conditional PDF in JUD is estimated using VTS for each Gaussian mixture component of the HMM rather than for the regression classes, it is thought that JAT will produce the same adapted HMM parameter as in NAT [15]_CITE"
"For example, the Jacobian Adaptation (JA) of noisy speech HMMs has shown better performance than the mathematical model based adaptation methods like PMC, especially when the amount of noise samples available is small [12]_CITE"
Molodtsov [1]_CITE proposed an uncertainty-soft set theory that is completely new approach for modeling vagueness
"Soft set has been extensively and successfully applied in decision making [2 19]_CITE, data analysis [20 22]_CITE, forecasting [23]_CITE, simulation [24]_CITE, evaluation of sound quality [25]_CITE, rule mining [26]_CITE, and so on."
"Combining soft sets with others mathematical theories, such as fuzzy sets [15,27 31]_CITE, rough set [28,31 33]_CITE, vague sets [34]_CITE, interval-valued fuzzy sets [10,12,35]_CITE, interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy soft set [36]_CITE, intuitionistic fuzzy soft set [35,37 39]_CITE, and so on, has come forth rapidly to meet various demands in practical situations."
Maji et al considered the initial level reduction soft set with the help of rough set approach [2]_CITE
Muhanmmad Irfan Ali discussed another view on reduction of parameters in soft sets [41]_CITE
"Attack campaigns targeting websites, eg, Beladen, Gumblar, and Nine-ball, successfully affected tens of thousands of websites in 2009 ( Websense_Security_Labs,_2009_CITE)"
"In addition to this mass compromising, we faced serious server-side vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed, ShellShock, and Poodle in 2014 ( Durumeric_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Guided approaches for efficiently discovering unknown malicious websites in web space have been proposed ( Invernizzi_et al.,_2012;_Zhang_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"Additionally, a decoy system using honeypots to attract attackers has been proposed ( Canali_and_Balzarotti,_2013_CITE)"
"We previously presented a prototype of our measurement system ( Akiyama_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"The key method is purposely leaking the bait credentials, called honeytokens ( Spitzner,_2003_CITE), of our web content management system (Web CMS), which is also a honeypot, to attackers to incur masquerade attacks"
"To detect known vulnerabilities, the detection modules, called HoneyPatches ( Akiyama_et al.,_2010_CITE), are applied to vulnerable functions on our honeyclient like a patch"
"To detect unknown vulnerabilities, our honeyclient also performs integrity checking of the file system, registry, and process, which are also implemented in Capture-HPC ( Honeynet_Project,_2008_CITE)."
"An attacker formerly requires recruiting a large amount of malware-infected hosts, eg, DNSChanger, Koobface, and ZeroAccess, to accomplish click-fraud monetization ( Blizard_and_Livic,_2013_CITE)"
"The use of DGAs has become popular since 2008 due to the emergence of Conficker ( Leder_and_Werner,_2009_CITE)"
"Countermeasures against DGAs, such as detecting and extracting AGDs and sinkholing, have already been implemented and contributed to disrupting C&C ( Conficker_Working_Group,_2011;_Shadowserver,_2014_CITE)"
"One ( in.cgi) is called Sutra-TDS in a previous paper ( Symantec_Security_Response_Blog,_2011_CITE), which is a toolkit for building a traffic distribution system (TDS)."
The report published by RiskAnalytics_(2016)_CITE mentioned that their originally observed IP addresses of an FFSN are also located at the same ASes we observed so that we recognized the commonly used bot-infected PCs for FFSNs
"It is said that BPR is typically used for an FFSN ( Honeynet_Project,_2007_CITE), which works as a reverse proxy to transparently send received HTTP requests to a backend server directly controlled by an attacker"
"The most popular cloaking technique is IP cloaking, which identifies client IP addresses, eg, detected repeated accesses or blacklisted IP addresses, and flexibly responds ( Rajab_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"It has been reported that almost all exploit kits have IP cloaking functionalities ( Eshete_and_Venkatakrishnan,_2014_CITE)"
"In addition, a security vendor's report mentioned that TDSs also conduct cloaking ( TrendMicro,_2011_CITE)"
"A domain takeover can observe the accesses from malware-infected hosts to a sinkholed domain of a C&C server and harvest theft sensitive information ( Stone-Gross_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"( MALICIA_Project,_2013;_Nappa_et al.,_2015_CITE) and malware-traffic-analysis.net ( HYPERLINK) are known to provide datasets of web-based attacks"
"Related work, eg, crawling benign websites ( Lee_and_Kim,_2012;_Li_et al.,_2012_CITE) or monitoring merged HTTP traffic of end users ( Stringhini_et al.,_2013_CITE), had the difficulty of finding malicious entities from a large amount of data that mainly contain benign entities"

"But it is more than that it is an experience marked by an interruption or discontinuity triggered by ideas, information, or phenomena that stops us in our tracks and prompts us to make connections that may have personal, organizational, community, or global outcomes ( McCay-Peet_&_Toms,_in_press_CITE)"
"While Jackson suggested that basic research facilitates serendipity, companies such as Google design buildings and rearrange furniture to maximise the potential for serendipitous encounters among co-workers ( Lindsay,_2013_CITE), and developers create mechanisms such as recommender systems to support serendipity for users in digital environments ( Shani_&_Gunawardana,_2011_CITE)"
"But despite a push to support serendipity and understand how it may be influenced (see for example, Makri,_Blandford,_Woods,_Sharples,_&_Maxwell,_2014_CITE), we know very little about how the complex relationships among the traits and abilities of individuals and the environments in which they are immersed may lead to serendipity"
"People have different notions of what serendipity means and what experiences they would describe as serendipitous ( McCay-Peet_&_Toms,_in_press_CITE)"
"Driving this process are the internal and external factors that are hypothesised to influence both the process and perception of serendipity ( McCay-Peet_&_Toms,_in_press_CITE)"
"Our definition of serendipity and its complementary model ( McCay-Peet_&_Toms,_in_press_CITE) share many of the features of previous definitions and discussions of serendipity in its emphasis on the unexpected and positive aspects of the phenomenon as well as the interaction that takes place between the individual and the environment that drives the experience"
"Merton, for example, postulated chance favours those at work in microenvironments that make for unanticipated sociocognitive interactions between those [with] prepared minds; what he referred to as the serendipitous sociocognitive microenvironment ( Merton_&_Barber,_2004,_pp._259 260_CITE)"
"The main elements of serendipity have similarly been described as a mix of unexpectedness and insight [that lead] to a valuable, unanticipated outcome ( Makri_&_Blandford,_2012,_p._684_CITE)"
"McBirnie_and_Urquhart_(2011)_CITE noted that their accepted understanding of the phenomenon requires the internal (eg, the prepared mind) and the external (eg, outside context and events) to come together in the right way, with neither on its own considered enough for the classification of an experience as serendipity (np)"
"While we know of no research that has tested whether the type of environment, digital or physical, influences the likelihood of experiencing serendipity, research does suggest that some environments are more likely to support serendipity than others (eg, Bj rneborn,_2008;_Toms,_1997_CITE)"
"Settings more conducive to serendipity include those designed to deliver information such as libraries, lecture rooms, as well as unfamiliar environments where new information can be found ( Sun_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
Toms_(1997)_CITE found in her experimental study of 47 adults that navigational mechanisms in a digital newspaper to support browsing also supported serendipity by exposing users to useful news stories they did not intend to find
Bj rneborn_(2008)_CITE examined the characteristics of the physical library space that lead to divergent behaviour
"Based on an investigative study of serendipity involving semi-structured interviews with twelve scholars and working professionals who shared specific experiences of work-related serendipity as well as prior research (eg, Bj rneborn,_2008_CITE), McCay-Peet_and_Toms_(in_press)_CITE identified four main external or environmental factors that may facilitate the process of serendipity an environment that is trigger-rich, highlights triggers, enables connections, and enables capturing"
"McCay-Peet,_Toms,_and_Kelloway_(2014)_CITE reexamined these four facets through a digital lens, proposed five facets of a potentially serendipitous digital environment, and developed a self-report questionnaire to measure how well a digital environment supports serendipity"
"The five facets are defined below: enables exploration, trigger-rich, highlights triggers, enables connections, and leads to the unexpected ( McCay-Peet_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Digital environments that enable exploration provide individuals with opportunities to bump into information and ideas they may not have otherwise found through mechanisms that, for example, allow users to browse content ( Toms,_1997_CITE)"
"The digital environment that enables exploration supports unimpeded and direct access, stopability, explorability, and multi-reachability ( Bj rneborn,_2008_CITE)"
"Trigger is one of the main elements of the process of serendipity ( McCay-Peet_&_Toms,_in_press_CITE)"
"Just as browsing depends on the ability of a piece of text to be recognised and examined ( Toms,_2000,_p._424_CITE), its textual affordances perceived, serendipity is reliant on an individuals interaction with text that can act as triggers of serendipity due to relationships to their own interests or needs, or what have been referred to as a person interest space or problem ( Bj rneborn,_2008;_Sun_et_al.,_2011;_Toms,_1997_CITE)"
"Face-to-face communication, visual saliency, noise, and emotion highlight triggers, bringing our focus of attention to information, ideas, or phenomenon we may not have otherwise noticed ( McCay-Peet_&_Toms,_in_press_CITE)"
"Our visual attention, for example, is known to be guided by size, colour, motion, and orientation ( Wolfe_&_Horowitz,_2004_CITE); therefore, applying these attributes to potential serendipitous triggers may help ensure they are noticed"
"Highlighting triggers through curiosity-invoking displays, striking contrasts, and pointers ( Bj rneborn,_2008_CITE) has been found to prompt divergent behaviour in physical libraries and thus may also prompt serendipity"
"With this rationale, Max, a web-based system that emails users links to websites with unexpected and interesting information ( Campos_&_Figueiredo,_2002_CITE), and Mitsikeru, an ambient intelligence system that calls attention to interesting or surprising content (webpage links) relative to the user through visual cues ( Beale,_2007_CITE), were both developed to support serendipity"
"Connections is another main element of the process of serendipity; the recognition of a relationship between the trigger and the individual knowledge and experience ( McCay-Peet_&_Toms,_in_press_CITE)"
"A serendipitous digital environment enables connections, something that may be possible through visualisation tools (eg, Thudt,_Hinrichs,_&_Carpendale,_2012_CITE) or social media sites that connect people to other people with interesting ideas and information"
"Unexpected thread is an important element of the process of serendipity; the unexpected, chance, accidental, or surprising element that is evident in one or more of the trigger, connection, follow-up, or valuable outcome elements of the serendipitous experience ( McCay-Peet_&_Toms,_in_press_CITE)"
"In physical environments, this may take the form of imperfections such as misshelved books in libraries ( Bj rneborn,_2008_CITE)"
"Creativity, like serendipity, has been linked to environmental conditions ( Mayfield_&_Mayfield,_2008_CITE)"
"For example, one broad definition of creativity includes the environment: creativity is a combination of interacting individual and environmental resources leading to the production of valuable solutions ( Mouchiroud_&_Bernoussi,_2008_CITE)"
"The theme of flexibility in the creative environment research (eg, Mayfield_&_Mayfield,_2008;_Mouchiroud_&_Bernoussi,_2008_CITE) finds a conceptual parallel with divergence in the serendipity research (eg, Bj rneborn,_2008;_Heinstr m,_2006_CITE)"
"With the right environmental conditions, an individual creative output may be enhanced leading to the creation of new products and ideas ( Oldham_&_Cummings,_1996_CITE) or creative solutions to social problems ( Mouchiroud_&_Bernoussi,_2008_CITE)"
"At face value, openness to experience and extraversion, two of the Big Five personality traits ( McCrae_&_John,_1992_CITE), appear central to serendipity"
"Lexical studies of personality structure commonly describe those open to experience as intellectual, creative, unconventional, innovative, [and] ironic while extraversion is associated with people who are outgoing, lively, extraverted, sociable, talkative, cheerful, [and] active ( Ashton_&_Lee,_2007,_p._154_CITE)"
"For example, Dantonio,_Makri,_and_Blandford_(2012)_CITE found in interviews with 15 postgraduates that spending both time and energy creating, sharing, and exploring social media content and making an effort to engage in conversations on social media sites had the potential to lead to more opportunity for serendipity"
"As noted earlier, the creative environment may play a key role in serendipity, but it has also been posited that creative imagination is a necessary component of serendipity in science; scientists must not only draw upon their knowledge and experience (prepared mind) but also their ingenuity and creativity to provide an explanation for unexpected observations ( Barber_&_Fox,_1958_CITE)."
"In research on students incidental information acquisition (IIA) ( Heinstr m,_2006_CITE), two studies ( N= 305 masters students; N= 27 library and information science students) in which the NEO Personality Inventory ( Costa_&_McCrae,_1992_CITE) was administered found a significant relationship between extraversion and incidental information acquisition (IIA) acquiring (useful or interesting) information while not consciously looking for it ( Heinstr m,_2006,_p._580_CITE), but not between openness to experience and IIA"
"McCrae_(1987)_CITE, for example, was careful to point out that while research indicates a relationship between openness to experience and divergent thinking, practice over time or incentives may lead those with relatively low openness scores to do equally well on divergent thinking tasks as open individuals"
"Serendipity is tightly associated with accident, luck, chance ( Fine_&_Deegan,_1996_CITE) and its perception tied to a lack of control ( Rubin,_Burkell,_&_Quan-Haase,_2011_CITE)"
"Consequently, the notion of trying to exert control over serendipity or facilitate it through the development of strategies ( Makri_et_al.,_2014_CITE) or the design of digital environments ( Andr , Teevan, & Dumais, 2009) is somewhat paradoxical (see McBirnie,_2008_CITE)"
"But some individuals appear able to reconcile control and lack of control in the context of serendipity, attributing their serendipitous experiences to both luck and choice or chance and preparation, for example ( McCay-Peet_&_Toms,_in_press_CITE)"
"However, locus of control exists on a continuum between internal and external and is defined as the degree to which an individual sees himself in control of his life and the events that influence it ( Locus_of_control,_n.d._CITE)"
"This challenge is evident in conflicting research findings in which individuals with an internal locus of control perceived their career paths were less influenced by chance events than those with an external locus of control in one study ( Bright,_Pryor,_&_Harpham,_2005_CITE) while a later study ( Bright,_Pryor,_Chan,_&_Rijanto,_2009_CITE) found no such relationship."

"The serendipitous digital environment scale ( McCay-Peet_et_al.,_2014_CITE), which was in the process of development and refined through research reported here, was used to both help further its development (see Section 7) and test relationships among serendipity, the environment, and individual differences"
"Moreover, the perception of serendipity scale gave us the tool needed to test the construct validity of the serendipitous digital environment scale ( McCay-Peet_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Prior research has designed direct measures of serendipity-related constructs to assess participants experience with information encountering ( Erdelez,_1995;_P lsd ttir,_2010_CITE), incidental information acquisition (IIA) ( Heinstr m,_2006_CITE), and incidental online news exposure ( Tewksbury,_Weaver,_&_Maddex,_2001_CITE)"
"Digital environments are pitted against environments in general (eg, digital libraries versus physical libraries) and comparisons are made between specific digital environments such as Twitter and Google, with one held up as superior to another (see, for example, Andrew,_2014_CITE)."
"While two of the statements in each of the sub-scales outlined in Table 2 use the word serendipity, one refers to serendipity in everyday life and the other to work-related serendipity because boundaries between the two appear to be blurred ( McCay-Peet_&_Toms,_in_press_CITE)"
One mirrors Erdelez s_(2005)_CITE definition of information encountering: an instance of accidental discovery of information during an active search for some other information (p
"The other was derived from Makri_and_Blandford s_(2012)_CITE main elements of serendipity identified a mix of unexpectedness and insight [that lead] to a valuable, unanticipated outcome (p"
"Variables measuring the serendipitous digital environment were derived from a scale comprised of five facets developed in prior research ( McCay-Peet_et_al.,_2014_CITE): enables exploration, enables connections, highlights triggers, trigger-rich, and leads to the unexpected (See Table 1, Row B)"
"The Creative Environment Perceptions variable was derived from the creative environment perceptions scale ( Mayfield_&_Mayfield,_2010_CITE)"
"Locus of Control of Behaviour: The locus of control of behaviour questionnaire ( Craig_et_al.,_1984_CITE) asks individuals to reflect on the extent to which they perceive that events are influenced by their own behaviour or, conversely, by something external to them through seventeen questionnaire items including as A great deal of what happens to me is probably just a matter of chance and Everyone knows that luck or chance determine one future"
"Openness to Experience: Lee_and_Ashton s_(2004)_CITE openness to experience questionnaire asks individuals how much they agree with sixteen statements relating to a person perceptions of their aesthetic appreciation, inquisitiveness, creativity, and unconventionality such as I enjoy looking at maps of different places and I would like a job that requires following a routine rather than being creative"
"Extraversion: The extraversion questionnaire ( Lee_&_Ashton,_2004_CITE) asks individuals how much they agree with sixteen questionnaire items relating to interpersonal behaviours that characterise their expressiveness, social boldness, sociability, and liveliness such as In social situations, I m usually the one who makes the first move and Most people are more upbeat and dynamic than I generally am"
"Creative environment perceptions ( Mayfield_&_Mayfield,_2010_CITE): nine items on a five-point agreement scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree; not applicable) that measures individuals perceptions of the level of creativity in their working environment."
"Openness to experience ( Lee_&_Ashton,_2004_CITE): 16 items on a five-point scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) that measures individuals perceptions of their own aesthetic appreciation, inquisitiveness, creativity, and unconventionality."
"Extraversion ( Lee_&_Ashton,_2004_CITE): 16 items on a five-point scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) that measures individuals interpersonal behaviours that characterise their expressiveness, social boldness, sociability, and liveliness."
"Locus of control of behaviour ( Craig_et_al.,_1984_CITE): 17 items on a six-point scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) that measures individuals sense of control on a range between internal and external."
"Recognising that serendipity is not limited to big-impact serendipity but encompasses a spectrum inclusive of micro-serendipity or unplanned everyday incidents ( Bogers_&_Bj rneborn,_2013,_p._205_CITE), we used the phrase, had not planned to find, to help cover the range of serendipitous experiences."
"For factor analysis, Meyers,_Gamst,_and_Guarino_(2006)_CITE recommend a sample size to variables ratio of ten to one, though not below N= 200"
"Comrey and Lee (1992, in Tabachnick_&_Fidell,_2013_CITE) consider factor loadings greater than .71 excellent, .63 very good, .55 good, .45 fair, and .32 poor"
"A solution is considered robust if it accounts for at least 50% of the total variance ( Tabachnick_&_Fidell,_2013_CITE)"
Subscale reliability or internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach alpha and DeVellis _(2003)_CITE guideline for interpreting alpha
"Effect sizes of partial 2 were interpreted as small (.01), medium (.09), and large (.25) ( Cohen,_1988_CITE)."
"However, this result makes sense relative to prior research indicating people more open to experience are more likely to use social media ( Amichai-Hamburger_&_Vinitzky,_2010_CITE) and thus perhaps more likely to select a social media site to assess for this study."
"Effect sizes of R 2 were interpreted as small (.02), medium (.13), and large (.26) ( Cohen,_1988_CITE)."
"Maybe it is enough for digital environments to be trigger-rich; users will notice what is most salient to them, what catches their interest, not just what is most visually salient ( McCay-Peet,_Lalmas,_&_Navalpakkam,_2012_CITE)"
"Or perhaps there is no relationship because a digital environment that highlights triggers prompts divergent behaviour, but not the more complex phenomenon of serendipity, the process of which involves five main elements: trigger, connection, follow-up, valuable outcomes, and an unexpected thread that runs through one or more of the elements ( McCay-Peet_&_Toms,_in_press_CITE)"
"While the environment may help shape people experience with serendipity (eg, Sun_et_al.,_2011_CITE), how creative their work environment is did not emerge as an important factor despite the apparent overlap between serendipity and creativity"
"But this was not the case despite the fact that control is often identified as an important theme in both general discussions of serendipity and efforts to support serendipity (eg, Rubin_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"However the concept of control in relation to the phenomenon of serendipity has elements of both personal agency (eg, prepared mind) and external influence (eg, chance events) and this push and pull may lead people to attribute their experiences to both internal and external factors ( McCay-Peet_&_Toms,_in_press_CITE)"
"While this research supports prior research that found people who are open to experience may use social media more than those closed to experience ( Amichai-Hamburger_&_Vinitzky,_2010_CITE), those who are closed to experience are just as likely to have serendipitous experiences within social media sites as their more open counterparts"
Extraversion weak relationship to serendipity buoys McBirnie_and_Urquhart s_(2011)_CITE caution that social interaction is not a necessary precursor of serendipity
"Research, for example, suggests that Twitter may be described as an information network rather than a social network due to the lack of reciprocal ties ( Kwak,_Lee,_Park,_and_Moon_(2010)_CITE."
"The three factors of the serendipitous digital environment scale that share a relationship with serendipity trigger-rich, enables connections, and leads to the unexpected help confirm the model of process of serendipity ( McCay-Peet_&_Toms,_in_press_CITE) that contains the corresponding elements of trigger, connection, and unexpected thread."

"Gause_and_Weinberg_(1990)_CITE Upon a close inspection, we can derive two different meanings for this statement: (1) Our customers deserve so much that nothing in the world can actually meet this requirement , or (2) Our customers are so undeserving that giving them nothing would be giving them too much"
"Another example Cooper_et al._(2007)_CITE is when a user asks the computer to Find restaurants in Virginia and Georgia, the user wants (restaurants in Virginia) AND (restaurants in Georgia)"

"Furthermore, the supported conditions is of limited expressiveness, since they do not include context-based policy specification using event-based context situations, nor trust-based policies, but only simple context information attributes are supported ( Conti_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"These abstract policies are specified in a more concise way that is more meaningful in contrast to the policies used in other approaches (eg Rasthofer_et al.,_2014_CITE), and are easier to understand without the need to consider many low-level technical details of the Android system"
"Many papers in the literature ( Enck_et al.,_2010;_Gibler_et al.,_2012;_Stirparo_and_Kounelis,_2012;_Zhou_and_Jiang,_2013_CITE) have shown apps with high invasion and manipulation on users' personal data"
"This exploitation is enabled by Android design vulnerabilities ( Shabtai_et al.,_2010_CITE), and is triggered by the increasing value of users' personal information in digital businesses."
"In this context, various solutions have been proposed to identify possible malicious apps and behaviours ( Aafer_et al.,_2013;_Arp_et al.,_2014;_Google,_2012;_Wu_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"Furthermore, it is almost impossible to guarantee the fairness of any given app, as it has been showed that centralised security checks ( eg, Google Bouncer, 2012_CITE) can be bypassed ( Ducklin,_2012;_Miller_and_Oberheide,_2012_CITE), while legitimate overprivileged apps ( Geneiatakis_et al.,_2015_CITE) can be manipulated in order to provide access to personal data as shown in Xing_et al._(2014)_CITE"
"More knowledgeable users might try to evaluate the list of requested permissions, but even for experts it is unclear how permissions are used ( Felt_et al.,_2012_CITE)."
"Indeed, their granularity is quite coarse, and, considering the 197 permissions of Android SDK version 17 associated to the 1259 methods with permission checks published in ( Felt_et al.,_2011_CITE), on average a permission is associated to 7 API methods"
"These apps are usually labelled as over-privileged ( Geneiatakis_et al.,_2015_CITE), and could lead to privilege escalation problems in terms of sensitive resources they can access after an update ( Xing_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Privilege escalation may also lead to confused deputy attacks, when an app that has been granted a specific permission is exploited by other apps that do not have this permission in order to perform sensitive tasks ( Felt_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"In this direction, TaintDroid ( Enck_et al.,_2010_CITE) as well as other research works ( Gibler_et al.,_2012;_Stirparo_and_Kounelis,_2012;_Zhou_and_Jiang,_2013_CITE) demonstrate the type of end-users' personal data manipulation performed by mobile apps"
"extracting static features ( ie, permissions and respective invoked methods of the Android API) from apps using the Dexpler ( Bartel_et al.,_2012_CITE) and Soot framework ( Vallee-Rai_et al.,_1999_CITE);"
identifying the sensitive method invocations incorporated in a given application using the permission map published in Felt_et al._(2011)_CITE.
Other orthogonal approaches such as Nan_et al._(2015)_CITE and Zhou_et al._(2013)_CITE reveal that runtime information gathering could disclose users' different states (inside/outside of their house) and impose a real threat even for their safety.
"Consequently, similar to pure Java applications, Android apps can be reverse-engineered using the appropriate tools, ie, smali/baksmali ( Gruver,_2009_CITE), ApkTool ( Tumbleson_and_Winiewski,_2010_CITE), Androguard ( Desnos,_2012_CITE), Dexpler ( Bartel_et al.,_2012_CITE) and Dex2Jar ( Pan,_2012_CITE)."
"We have performed a complete isolated evaluation of the policy evaluation delay and scalability issues in a previous publication by some of the co-authors ( Neisse_et al.,_2015_CITE)."
"According to Callaham_(2014)_CITE users have an average of 95 apps installed in their Android phones, and according to Au_et al._(2012)_CITE there are around 750 API methods associated with the available permissions in Android version 4.3.1"
"This average number of apps and possible API methods would be equivalent to around 71 thousand policies, which according to the PDP evaluation results published in Neisse_et al._(2015)_CITE would correspond to a response time of around 100 ms"
Approaches like Damopoulos_et al._(2014)_CITE and Grace_et al._(2012)_CITE that focus specifically on malware detection is out of the scope of this paper
"Kirin, proposed by Enck_et al._(2009)_CITE, is a security service running on the phone which analyses the requested permissions of an app and detects potential security flaws"
Ongtang_et_al._(2009)_CITE propose Saint as an extension of Kirin
"Also Apex, introduced by Nauman_et al._(2010)_CITE, focuses on policy enforcement for regulating ICC flows"
"Orthogonally to our proposal, Dietz_et al.,_2011_CITE) propose QUIRE as a solution to protect android apps manipulation by other malicious apps or services"
"In the same direction, Porscha, proposed by Ongtang_et al._(2010)_CITE, introduces a Digital Rights Management (DRM) framework for Android phones that mediates the access to protected content between different Android components"
"CRePE, introduced by Conti_et al._(2011)_CITE ., is also a customised Android OS system able to enforce fine-grained security policies considering time and location features"
"Bai_et al._(2010)_CITE propose a context-aware usage control that focus on a user basis mechanism for granting and revoking permissions, similar to the approach introduced in the latest android OS version"
"In a similar direction, Sun_et al._(2012)_CITE introduce a design that requires the modification of Android sandbox as well, in order to monitor access to sensitive information"
"On the contrary, SecureDroid ( Arena_et al.,_2013_CITE) extends Android OS security manager service to control access also for user defined sensitive URIs."
"Batyuk_et al._(2011)_CITE introduced Androlyzer, a server based solution that focuses mainly on informing users about apps potential security and privacy risks"
Papamartzivanos_et al._(2014)_CITE propose a cloud-based crowd-sourcing architecture where users share any locally logged information about the app of interest
"TISSA, proposed by Zhou_et al._(2011)_CITE, introduces a privacy mode functionality in Android with coarse-grained control over the behaviour of an app"
"Complementary, AppFence proposed by Hornyack_et al._(2011)_CITE ., also implemented as a modified OS on the basis of TaintDroid, shadows and ex-filtrates users' private data according to their preferences."
Feth_and_Pretschner_(2012)_CITE employ information flow tracking as well
Jung_et al._(2013)_CITE extend the work of Feth and Pretschner with context-aware policy rules
"In this direction, Andriatsimandefitra_et al._(2012)_CITE introduce an approach for determining data flows, which is an important aspect for realising a policy enforcement tool"
"In an alternative approach, Xu_et al._(2012)_CITE introduce an additional sandbox security service for protecting users' against apps malicious behaviour, namely Aurasium"
"Constroid, introduced by Schreckling_et al._(2012)_CITE, also defines a management framework for employing data-centric security policies of fine granularity"
Zefferer_and_Teufl_(2013)_CITE propose a solution for device security assessment based on user defined preferences
"SEDalvik, introduced by Bousquet_et al._(2013)_CITE, proposes a MAC mechanism to regulate information flows between apps objects building on the advantages of Dalvik internal debugger"
"Schreckling_et al._(2013)_CITE introduce Kynoid, a solution that extends Taintdroid with security policies at the variable level"
"AppGuard, introduced by Backes_et al._(2013)_CITE, is an app instrumentation framework that runs directly in users' device and allows user-centric security policies customisations"
The solution presented by Bartel_et al._(2012)_CITE follows the same direction
"Zhauniarovich_et al._(2014)_CITE propose MOSES, which enforces context-based policy specification at the kernel level, meaning that MOSES requires a modification to the underlying OS"
"IdentiDroid, proposed by Shebaro_et al._(2014)_CITE, is a customised version of Android which gives to the user the possibility to switch in an anonymous modality that shadows sensitive data and block permissions at runtime"
DroidForce proposed by Rasthofer_et al._(2014)_CITE relies on the Soot framework for analysing and instrumenting an app to enforce a security policy
"Complementary, Jing_et al._(2015)_CITE propose DeepDroid, which in contrast to DroidForce performs instrumentation at the native level with the possibility of intercepting system calls in addition to methods invocation to regulate the access to sensitive resources"
Bagheri_et al._(2015)_CITE in DroidGuard introduce a framework for modelling inter-app vulnerabilities and employing the appropriate protection mechanism to enhance user's privacy and security
"We also plan to launch a community-based release of our tool where users can contribute with abstract policies and refinement models of privacy sensitive activities, for example, integrating the results of other Android security approaches (eg Rasthofer_et al.,_2014_CITE) that cannot be easily reused at the moment."
"A temporal expression, also called timex, refers to any natural language phrase denoting a temporal entity such as an interval or a time point [1]_CITE"
"Temporal expressions can be of three different types [2]_CITE: fully-qualified, deictic and anaphoric"
"Early attempts of automatically annotating temporal expressions in texts started in late 1990s [6]_CITE, and aroused an increasing interest with the proposal of a temporal annotation scheme [7]_CITE, mainly aiming at enhancing performance of question answering systems"
"Following the work of Ahn et al [2]_CITE, the temporal expression extraction task is now conventionally divided into two main steps: identification and normalisation"
"In the normalisation step, the aim is to interpret and represent the temporal meaning of each pre-identified expression often using the TimeML format [8]_CITE"
"The normalisation task is usually focussed on predicting the two main temporal expressions attributes: type of the temporal expression (eg SET, DURATION, DATE or TIME) and its full value according to the ISO-8601 format [9]_CITE."
"Llorens et al [14,15]_CITE successively added semantic features using a similar architecture"
"Poveda et al [16]_CITE introduced a sophisticated semi-supervised approach which particularly helped to improve the recall, while Mani et al [7]_CITE used rules learned by a decision tree classifier"
Ling and Weld [17]_CITE tried Markov Logic Network in order to extract temporal relations
"Recently, the results from the last temporal information extraction challenge, TempEval-3 [5]_CITE, show the identification performance ranges from 0.81 to 0.90 in terms of lenient F =1 measure (from 0.70 to 0.83 for strict matching)."
"Grover et al [18]_CITE, for example, used regular expression-based rules on top of a pre-existing identification system"
"UzZaman and Allen [19]_CITE developed TRIOS, an open-source rule-based normaliser, focussing on type and value attributes prediction"
Llorens et al [20]_CITE extended this architecture making it community-driven: Internet users are allowed to candidate new rules to be integrated in a central rule repository
Angeli et al [21]_CITE proposed a method to learn interpreting temporal representations through the use of a compositional grammar for temporal expressions
Recent TempEval-3 normalisation accuracies ranged from 0.68 to 0.86 (for value) and 0.86 to 0.94 (for type attribute) [5]_CITE.
"More recently, NavyTime [24]_CITE and HeidelTime [25]_CITE proposed a set of hand-crafted rules combined with an ad-hoc rule selection algorithm, whereas SUTime [26]_CITE used a deterministic rule-based system built on top of the Stanford Core NLP pipeline."
"Recently, temporal information extraction aroused increasing interest in the medical domain [27 30]_CITE, where temporal information can be used to automatically extract patient clinical histories or temporal cause effect relations with respect to particular treatments"
"More specifically, the results from i2b2 2012 [28]_CITE show that the identification accuracies range from 0.84 to 0.90, whereas normalisation accuracies rage from 0.54 to 0.73 (for value) and 0.72 to 0.89 for (for type attribute)."
"The approach proposed in this paper adopts the dichotomy between identification and normalisation [2]_CITE, and therefore it consists of two components"
"Because of this trade-off, we developed a post-processing pipeline on top of the CRFs sequence labeller to boost the identification performance, similarly to the approach proposed by Adafre and de Rijke [31]_CITE."
For lemma and POS tags we use TreeTagger [32]_CITE
"We note that this group of features constitutes an extension of those previously used in the field [33,34]_CITE"
") are known in linguistics to be characterised by having antonyms, whereas the rest of temporal expression words typically do not [35]_CITE"
"The set of WordNet-based features negatively affects the overall classification performance, as already noticed in the literature [38]_CITE"
The normalisation phase aims to interpret and represent the temporal meaning of each pre-identified expression using the TimeML format [8]_CITE
"Consequently, the overall score for temporal information extraction is computed using the following formula (also used at TempEval-3): (8)Score=F =1*valueaccuracywhere F =1 denotes the lenient matching measure [5]_CITE."
Our other future work will focus on the investigation of local semantics representation for temporal expressions [40]_CITE
"In more detail, we work with schemas that partly correspond to OWL Lite [1]_CITE and support the equivalent of named classes, datatype and object properties, minCardinalities and maxCardinalities, InverseFunctionalProperties, subset constraints, and disjointness constraints"
"of two theories induced by two sets of constraints are based on the satisfiability algorithm for Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form with at most two literals per clause, described in [2]_CITE"
Euzenat and Shvaiko [3]_CITE present a comprehensive survey of ontology matching
"Rahm and Bernstein [4]_CITE survey schema matching, and Bernstein and Melnik [5]_CITE list the requirements for model management systems that support the matching process"
K pcke and Rahm [6]_CITE comparatively analyze eleven frameworks for entity matching.
"For example, Melnik et al [7]_CITE and Madhavan et al [8]_CITE describe syntactic techniques based on modeling the schemas as graphs"
Bilke and Naumann [9]_CITE propose a semantic technique based on an analysis of duplicated instances
Brauner et al [10]_CITE adopt this strategy to align thesauri
Wang et al [11]_CITE describe a semantic technique based on probing the databases.
"Departing from this classification, Qi and Ling [12]_CITE present algorithms to resolve schematic discrepancies by transforming metadata into the attribute values of entity types, keeping the information and constraints of original schemas"
Zhao and Ram [13]_CITE propose an iterative procedure for detecting both schema-level and instance-level matchings from heterogeneous data sources.
"The use of templates to help exchange schemas, as proposed in Papott and Torlone [16]_CITE, is a similar strategy that may also be used to circumvent interoperability problems."
"As for the mappings between the external schema and the mediated schema, two basic approaches have been used [17]_CITE"
"Several projects, such as TSIMMIS [18]_CITE, IBIS [19]_CITE and INFOMIX [20]_CITE adopt the GAV approach."
The data sources are in turn defined as views over the mediated schema [21]_CITE
This approach improves maintainability and extensibility of the systems [9]_CITE
Picsel [22]_CITE is an example of a LAV system.
"Mappings may also be classified according to their accuracy into sound, complete and exact [17,23]_CITE"
"Finally, V is exact, when all data provided by V satisfies E, and all data satisfying E is provided by V [23]_CITE."
Rull et al [24]_CITE present an approach for validating schema mappings that allows the mapping designer to ask whether they have certain desirable properties.
"Yet, we consider that constraints should be included in the mediated schema to capture the common semantics of the data sources, unlike most proposals based on the concept of exact views, which assume that the mediated schema has no constraints, as observed in [17]_CITE."
Cal et al [23]_CITE argue that the constraints of a mediated schema should be taken into account during query processing and that the schema definition language should incorporate flexible and powerful representation mechanisms for integrity constraints
"Calvanese et al [25]_CITE introduce a Description Logics framework, similar to that in Section 3.1, to address schema integration and query answering"
"Atzeni et al [26]_CITE cover the problem of rewriting a schema from one model to another, but they do not touch on the more complex problem of generating a new set of constraints that generalizes a pair of sets of constraints from different schemas, which we address in Section 4"
"Hick and Hainaut [27]_CITE show how requirements changes are propagated to database schemas, to data and to programs through a general strategy"
Hartmann et al [28]_CITE apply techniques from Propositional Logic to offer decision support for specifying Boolean and multivalued dependencies.
"When compared with the DL-Lite family, as aptly condensed in [1]_CITE, the schemas we consider treat maxCardinality as a negated form of minCardinality and formulate concept inclusions and disjunctions in such a way that negated descriptions occur only on the right-hand side of inclusions"
"This and other limitations are formulated as restrictions on the schema constraints themselves, and not on the descriptions that occur in the constraints, as in [1]_CITE"
"The subsumption problem is decidable for expressive dialects of DL, but typically belongs to hard complexity classes [29]_CITE, especially in the presence of axioms (or constraints) [30]_CITE"
"For certain dialects of DL, there are polynomial time decision procedures for the subsumption problem that explore the structure of the concept descriptions and that are, for this reason, called structural subsumption procedures [31,32]_CITE"
"Furthermore, the reductions suggested to encode the axioms lead us back to dialects for which the subsumption problem is hard [30]_CITE."
"of the theories induced by two sets of constraints, we depart from the tradition of Description Logics deduction services, which are mostly based on tableaux techniques [29]_CITE"
"The decision procedure described in Section 4.2 is based on the satisfiability algorithm for Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form with at most two literals per clause, described in [2]_CITE"
We adopt a family of attributive languages [33]_CITE defined as follows
We will work with extralite schemas that partly correspond to OWL Lite [1]_CITE
"Steps 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 2.1 may be carried out by the automated matching process we discussed in [35 37]_CITE"
"As for future work, we plan to extend the schema matching framework described in [39]_CITE to a full-fledged tool that helps create mediation environments, by including the strategy described in this article"
"Synthesis, also known as Church solvability problem [5]_CITE, is the problem of defining a circuit that continually reacts on an infinite input stream by producing one output letter after receiving one input letter"
"Pnueli and Rosner extended the question to a setting, where the processes have access to incomplete information [12,10,9,7,1]_CITE"
"Pnueli and Rosner have shown that the synthesis problem is undecidable for the architecture shown in Fig_1 [12]_CITE and hence in general, and Finkbeiner and Schewe [7]_CITE have identified the class of architectures, in which synthesis is decidable."
"In this article, we show that distributed synthesis is undecidable even for the syntactic safety and reachability fragments of LTL [11,6]_CITE, of ACTL [6]_CITE, and of their semantic intersection"
"We assume that the reader is familiar with temporal logics [11,6]_CITE and the distributed synthesis question [12,10,9,7]_CITE"
"For architectures [12,9,10,7]_CITE, it is enough to know that they are directed graphs, whose vertices are processes that operate synchronously on a joint system clock"
"The processes consist of an environment, which cannot be controlled, and provides an unconstrained behaviour, and processes for which we want to construct a control strategy (the circuit in Church [5]_CITE terms)"
"For example, in emerging applications [22]_CITE such as mobile domestic robots, merely knowing where a robot is not enough: a robot often needs some information about its immediate environment in order to take appropriate decisions"
"In the case of feature-based SLAM [9]_CITE, for example, a lack of features, or a highly occluded environment, can reduce accuracy."
We addressed the first of these questions in previous work [30]_CITE.
"Finally, in contrast to signal-based methods of location landmarks [37]_CITE, the debugging of this type of navigation data ie images, or patches within images is uniquely human-readable: it can be done simply through human observation of what might have visibly changed along the path"
"Nevertheless, recent progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) [24]_CITE and parallel tracking and mapping (PTAM) [19]_CITE have yielded stunning results in producing geometric models of a physical, recovering geometry and camera pose simultaneously from hand-held devices."
"At the same time, being able to recognize certain objects while performing SLAM could improve accuracy, reducing the need for loop closure and allowing better more reliable self-calibration [32]_CITE"
"Appearance-based navigation, closely related to navigation, has been reported as one of many mechanisms used in biology, and has been explored by various groups in different animals (see, for example, [6,10,13]_CITE)"
"Localization systems often rely on motion models embedded into tracking algorithms, such as Kalman, extended Kalman [9]_CITE filtering, or particle-filtering [27]_CITE, to infer position"
"More recently, general purpose graphics processing units (GP-GPUs) have enabled camera position to be quickly and accurately inferred relative to a point cloud by registering whole images with dense textured models [24]_CITE."
Research into the mechanisms employed by humans during pedestrian navigation suggests that multisensory integration plays a key role [25]_CITE
"Indeed, studies into human spatial memory using virtual reality and functional neuroimaging [3,4]_CITE suggest that the human brain uses a combination of representations to self-localize that might be termed as allocentric and egocentric"
"For example, in the hippocampus, there are at least four classes [14]_CITE of encoding associated with position and heading"
Hippocampal place cells display elevated firing when the animal is in a particular location [11]_CITE
"Grid cells, on the other hand, show increased firing rates when the animal is present at a number of locations on a spatial grid; this suggests that some form of joint neuronal encoding is at work, and, indeed, there is some evidence that place cell responses arise through a combination of grid cells of different spacing [23]_CITE"
The dataset is publicly available for download at HYPERLINK [29]_CITE.
Based on the use of optical flow in motion estimation [39]_CITE and space-time descriptors in action recognition [38]_CITE we estimated in-plane motion vectors using a simple approach
"The spatial patch descriptors consist of the Dense-SIFT descriptor [20,21,34]_CITE and a tuned, odd-symmetric Gabor-based descriptor"
We compared these with another single-frame technique devised in our lab: we used filters that we previously tuned on PASCAL VOC data [12]_CITE for image categorization
"The three methods are (i) HOG 3D, introduced by Kl ser et al [18]_CITE; (ii) our space-time, antisymmetric Gabor filtering process (ST_GABOR); and (iii) our spatial derivative, temporal Gaussian (ST_GAUSS) filter"
"This allows three-dimensional gradient estimation across multiple scales using the integral video representation, a direct extension of the integral image idea [36]_CITE"
"We used the dense HOG 3D option from the implementation of the authors [18]_CITE, and the settings yielded approximately 2000 descriptors per frame of video."
"Space-time Gabor (ST_GABOR) functions have been used in activity recognition, structure from motion and other applications [2]_CITE"
"Thus, we applied vector quantization (VQ) to the descriptors, then used histograms of VQ descriptors, effectively representing each frame as a histogram of words [7]_CITE"
"Two different approaches to the VQ of descriptors were taken, one based on standard k-means, using a Euclidean distance measure (hard assignment, HA ), and one corresponding to the Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) [16]_CITE"
"Further advances to the basic VLAD, which include different normalizations and multiscale approaches, are given by [1]_CITE"
"To compare encodings, either 2 or Hellinger distance metrics [35]_CITE were used to retrieve results for HA and VLAD encoding approaches respectively"
"We chose the EKF Mono SLAM [5]_CITE, which uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) with 1-point RANSAC"
"We chose this implementation for three reasons: (a) it is a monocular SLAM technique, so comparison with the single-camera approach is fairer; (b) the authors of this package report error estimates in the form of error distributions; and (c) the errors from video with similar resolutions (240 320) to ours were reported as being below 2 m for some sequences [5]_CITE in their dataset."
"The feature detector, a FAST corner detector [31]_CITE, produced a small number of features in its original configuration"
The best performance compares very favorably with reported errors in positioning from multi-point WiFi signal strength measurements using landmark-based recognition that employs multiple (non-visual) sensing [33]_CITE
"Motivated by this consideration, a general framework Population-based Algorithm Portfolios (PAP) has been proposed [17]_CITE."
"Despite the promising preliminary results, both empirical and theoretical analysis revealed that the performance of PAP is sensitive to its constituent EAs [17]_CITE"
"This idea has been explored for more than ten years, and early investigations are mainly dedicated to combinatorial problems [10,11]_CITE"
"Recently, PAP was proposed to generalize this idea to numerical optimization, with a focus on EAs [17]_CITE"
"This concept has been intensively investigated in the evolutionary computation community since 1990s, but most early research focused on integrating multiple search operators (eg, different mutation operators) into an EA, eg, [1,13,14,18]_CITE"
"For example, Vrugt et al [25]_CITE proposed a multi-algorithm genetically adaptive method (AMALGAM), which combines multiple EAs together"
"Besides, the emerging research on Ensemble of Evolutionary Algorithms (EEAs) also employs the idea of combining multiple search techniques [16,30]_CITE"
"The objective of PAP is more realistic than seeking an approach that performs the best for all problem instances, since such an approach may not even exists because of the no-free-lunch theorem [26]_CITE."
"Although the accuracy of such an estimate is by no means guaranteed, it has been commonly employed in many other scenarios, eg, fine-tuning the parameters of an EA [4]_CITE, where the performance of an EA needs to be estimated."
"In case that the number of candidate EAs is huge and direct enumeration becomes prohibitive, Eq (4) can still be integrated with some existing search method, say forward selection [12]_CITE, to yield at least a sub-optimal set of constituent algorithms within an acceptable time period."
"For example, statistical racing [4,29]_CITE is a general-purpose tool to find an algorithm that performs as well as possible on a problem class"
"Some recently developed approaches, such as Meta-Learning techniques [9,24]_CITE, Mapping method introduced in [23]_CITE and Empirical Hardness Models [15]_CITE, also utilize a set of problem instances for training"
"A representative method in this category is the so-called racing multiple algorithms on a single problem approach proposed by Yuan and Gallagher [29]_CITE, which is an extension of statistical racing"
"AMALGAM [25]_CITE and EEAs [16,30]_CITE also adopted a similar adaptation strategy as intra-AOTA"
"According to [19]_CITE, a linearly decreasing inertia weight over the course of the search is employed in wPSO"
"As suggested in [19]_CITE, the variant that employs the best individual in the population as the main parent for generating offspring was used"
The reason is that a PAP instantiation will behave similarly to its best constituent algorithm when it only consists of 2 constituent algorithms [17]_CITE
"In the context of ensemble learning, the term different is referred to as diversity and a lot of studies have been carried out to investigate how diversity can be quantitatively defined and be utilized to construct good ensembles [22]_CITE"
It is stated in Henley_and_Hand_(1997)_CITE that companies could make significant future savings if an improvement of only a fraction of a percent could be made in the accuracy of the credit scoring techniques implemented
"Typical examples of low default portfolios include high-quality corporate borrowers, banks, sovereigns and some categories of specialised lending ( Van_Der_Burgt,_2007_CITE) but in some countries even certain retail lending portfolios could turn out to have very low numbers of defaults compared to the majority class"
"In a recent FSA publication regarding conservative estimation of low default portfolios, regulatory concerns were raised about whether firms can adequately asses the risk of LDPs ( Benjamin,_Cathcart,_&_Ryan,_2006_CITE)."
"This is a measure of the discrimination power of a classifier without regard to class distribution or misclassification cost ( Baesens_et_al.,_2003_CITE)."
"The recommendations given were for a set of simple robust non-parametric tests for the statistical comparison of the classifiers ( Dem ar,_2006_CITE)"
"For example, in Baesens_et_al._(2003)_CITE seventeen techniques including both well-known techniques such as logistic regression and discriminant analysis and more advanced techniques such as least square support vector machines were compared on eight real-life credit scoring data sets"
"For example, in Yobas,_Crook,_and_Ross_(2000)_CITE, the authors found that linear discriminant analysis (LDA) outperformed neural networks in the prediction of loan default, whereas in Desai,_Crook,_and_Overstreet_(1996)_CITE, neural networks were reported to actually perform significantly better than LDA"
"Hence, the issue of which classification technique to use for credit scoring, particularly with a small number of bad observations, remains a challenging problem ( Baesens_et_al.,_2003_CITE)."
"In Weiss_and_Provost_(2003)_CITE it was found that the naturally occurring class distributions in the 25 data sets looked at, often did not produce the best-performing classifiers"
"Alternatively, a progressive adaptive sampling strategy for selecting the optimal class distribution is proposed in Provost,_Jensen,_and_Oates_(1999)_CITE"
"Chawla,_Bowyer,_Hall,_and_Kegelmeyer_(2002)_CITE proposed a synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) which was applied to example data sets in fraud, telecommunications management, and detection of oil spills in satellite images"
"In Japkowicz_(2000)_CITE, over-sampling and downsizing were compared to the author own method of learning by recognition in order to determine the most effective technique"
"Subsequently, Batista_(2004)_CITE identified ten alternative techniques in dealing with class imbalances and trialed them on thirteen data sets"
"Also, a combination of either SMOTE ( Chawla_et_al.,_2002_CITE) and Tomek links or SMOTE and ENN (a nearest-neighbour cleaning rule), were proposed."
"The logistic regression model then takes the form: (1)logit( ) log 1- = + Tx,where is the intercept parameter and T contains the variable coefficients ( Hosmer_&_Stanley,_2000_CITE)."
"Neural networks (NN) are mathematical representations modelled on the functionality of the human brain ( Bishop,_1995_CITE)"
"The least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) proposed by Suykens,_Van_Gestel,_De_Brabanter,_De_Moor,_and_Vandewalle_(2002)_CITE is a further adaptation of Vapnik original SVM formulation which leads to solving linear KKT (Karush Kuhn Tucker) systems (rather than a more complex quadratic programing problem)"
"The optimisation problem for the LS-SVM is defined as: (6)minw,b,eJ(w,b,e)=12wTw+ 12 i=1Nei2,subject to the following equality constraints: (7)yiwT (xi)+b=1-ei,i=1, ,N,Where w is the weight vector in primal space, is the regularisation parameter, and yi = +1 or 1 for good (bad) payers, respectively ( Suykens_et_al.,_2002_CITE)"
"The k-nearest neighbours algorithm ( k-NN) classifies a data point by taking a majority vote of its k most similar data points ( Hastie,_Tibshirani,_&_Friedman,_2001_CITE)"
"A range of [10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000] trees has been assessed, as well as three different settings for the number of randomly selected attributes per tree ([0.5,1,2].M), whereby M denotes the number of attributes within the respective data set ( Breiman,_2001_CITE)"
"The number of iterations was varied in the range [10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000], with a maximum branch size of two selected for the splitting rule ( Friedman,_2001_CITE)"
"The Nemenyi post hoc test states that the performances of two or more classifiers are significantly different if their average ranks differ by at least the critical difference (CD), given by (12)CD=q , ,KK(K+1)12D.In this formula, the value q , , K is based on the studentised range statistic ( Nemenyi,_1963_CITE)"
"Note that, even though the differences between the classifiers are small, it is important to note that in a credit scoring context, an increase in the discrimination ability of even a fraction of a percent may translate into significant future savings ( Henley_&_Hand,_1997_CITE)."
"The analysis of texture images has played a fundamental role in computer vision and pattern recognition during the last decades and the importance of this area of study is illustrated by the number of applications appearing in diverse areas such as Engineering [12]_CITE, Medicine [1]_CITE and Physics [6]_CITE."
"Examples are the theory of textons [17]_CITE, local patterns [14]_CITE, local affine regions [11]_CITE, invariants of scattering transforms [15]_CITE, Fast Features Invariant to Rotation and Scale of Texture [16]_CITE and others [3]_CITE"
"Many of these efforts consider fixed sized neighbourhoods to extract basic parameters such as moments [8]_CITE and histograms [14,17]_CITE"
"In simple terms, it is a generalisation to the three-dimensional Euclidean space of the local connected fractal dimension of binary images previously reported in [10,18]_CITE."
In [10]_CITE a connectivity measurement is associated to each pixel p of the object (foreground) by counting the number of foreground pixels connected to p within a neighbourhood with radius r
The ability of the connected fractal dimension to differentiate between images of normal and abnormal retinal vessels in [10]_CITE suggests that concept of connectivity might also be useful in other applications where the local regularity of the binary image needs to be assessed
"To extend the notion of connectivity to grey-level images, a strategy was proposed in [5]_CITE based on a pseudo-three-dimensional representation of grey-level images"
"While in [5]_CITE a cube centred at p was used, here we use a ball or sphere to preserve the geometrical symmetry in the local neighbourhood"
"2 illustrates the local connectivity for four images from the UIUC database [9]_CITE, belonging to two different classes"
"Such example illustrates that whereas the connectivity index shows its importance in a multifractal context in [5]_CITE, it also could be a useful local descriptor on its own"
The logarithm can be justified in a similar way: the connectivity index scales exponentially as described in [5]_CITE and the logarithm attenuates the wide range of scales in the feature space
The version of Outex database used here is the suite Outex_TC_00013 in [13]_CITE and contains 1360 colour images (here converted to a grey-scale) captured under controlled conditions of illumination and imaging geometry
The classification of the databases according to the compared descriptors was carried out using a linear discriminant classifier (LDA) [4]_CITE after a principal component analysis (PCA) [4]_CITE to reduce the correlation among features in all compared approaches
The parameter rmax was set to 5 in all tests based on the observation in [5]_CITE that larger radii severely increase the computational cost and number of descriptors without a significant gain in the classification performance
"The research has been mostly organized around the following three key areas [19]_CITE: (1) application of classification methods to fMRI data (eg [1,8 11,23 26]_CITE), including combinations of classifiers also known as ensemble models (eg [17,28,29]_CITE), (2) dimensionality reduction techniques (eg [2,3,10,21,23,30]_CITE) and (3) spatio-temporal filtering (eg [18]_CITE)"
"According to data mining practitioners [20]_CITE, data preparation 1 1In this context data preparation is a term encompassing integration of data from multiple sources, sampling, labelling and standard preprocessing (eg data transformation, editing/imputation, attribute selection)"
"In modelling of the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal, this effect is additionally magnified by the haemodynamic response delay [13]_CITE and relatively low resolution of the images [27]_CITE"
"The alignment issue is however often ignored and all snapshots taken while a certain stimulus is active are routinely averaged [27]_CITE (in some cases trimming 1 2 initial snapshots), or labelled with this particular stimulus [17]_CITE"
In this paper we use the data collected by Haxby within his seminal study Distributed and Overlapping Representations of Faces and Objects in Ventral Temporal Cortex [14]_CITE
"Following [17]_CITE, we have first selected a subset of voxels by cross-training 6 6In k-fold cross-training each of the k base models is trained on the union of k 1 folds, every time leaving a different fold aside"
"The intersection of the 10 sets obtained in this way resulted in 92 voxels common for all sessions ( Fig_6 ), which is a slightly different result when compared to [17]_CITE, where the authors have reported the intersection to contain 93 voxels"
"As it can be seen, a simple linear classifier ( ldc) was able to achieve an average accuracy of 74.2%, not only vastly outperforming other tested classifiers, but also outperforming the Random Forest ensemble from [17]_CITE at the fraction of computations, yet still leaving room for improvement"
"This can be caused by natural variability in the onset of the haemodynamic response function or the initial dip in the BOLD response reported in some studies (for example [31]_CITE and references therein), resulting in a rather noisy pattern at the output of the fMRI device"
"On the other hand, the third and fourth TRs (between 5 and 10 s) appear to be the easiest to classify on average, which is also more or less consistent with the effect of the haemodynamic lag causing the blood oxygenation level to peak around 5 after stimulus presentation [13]_CITE."
"This is a measure inspired by clustering algorithms [4]_CITE, designed to encourage formation of groups of samples, which are similar to each other while dissimilar to the samples in other groups"
"Although beyond the scope of this study, it might be instructive to closely examine the setup of the fMRI experiment in [14]_CITE looking for an explanation of this phenomenon."
An important issue is therefore that robots should be able to create their own internal representations [31]_CITE
"In the field of developmental robotics, it is assumed that a robot system is not programmed for specific and fixed tasks, but rather programmed to develop and learn new behavioural and cognitive competence and skills autonomously [2]_CITE."
"For example, Marjanovic et al [32]_CITE introduced a robotic system, through the use of a RBF neural network, which learns to point towards visual targets"
Hafner and Kaplan [14]_CITE applied a multi-layer-perceptron network to train a robot to interpret the pointing gestures of another robot
"Doniec et al emphasised that the task of pointing accelerates the learning of robotic joint attention, and created Jacobian matrices to deal with the pointing gestures [11]_CITE"
"Shademan et al [39]_CITE made use of a locally least squares algorithm, based on a Jacobian estimation method, to build a robotic visual-motor learning system"
Sheldon and Lee [40]_CITE described a developmental approach for implementing a pointing learning framework by creating a schema mechanism
Liu [28]_CITE and Liu et al [29]_CITE proposed a fuzzy qualitative framework to describe the robotic arm sensory-motor problem
"Also, Lemme et al defined two types of robotic pointing pattern using different learning machines to imitate how to point [26]_CITE"
"In their research, Jamone et al created an interactive learning strategy to build a reachable map that can handle reaching rather than pointing movements [18,19]_CITE"
"Compared with the Deep Learning as described in [13]_CITE, the developmental approach exhibits staged incremental learning ability, which helps reduce the robot learning complexity"
"In particular, if a robot end-effectors block the object within the robot view, the gesture is generally regarded as a pointing gesture [26,40]_CITE"
"Also, the pointing gesture may be defined as the robot end-effector in the closest position to the object [7]_CITE"
"Other work only indicates that a robot gaze is linked to an arm gesture, called a pointing gesture [37]_CITE"
"When an artificial neural network is used for implementation, its generalisation property can help to produce the reaching gestures, which may point at the object [7]_CITE"
The visual servo repeatedly works until the end-effector covers the object [26]_CITE
Developmental psychological findings indicate that pointing emergence has been recognised as the first step of a human infant social cognitive development and the foundation of an infant early linguistic skills [44]_CITE
Vygotsky pointed out that pointing motions develop out of unsuccessful capture behaviours in which the infant attempts to reach for a certain object which is beyond his/her hand reach range [46]_CITE
"Developmental psychology presents evidence that lifting constraints can lead infants to progressing from a certain competence level to a new, even more complicated competence level [35]_CITE"
"Thus, developmental constraints reduce the learning complexity [2,31]_CITE"
"Based on this finding, our previous research [25]_CITE has led to a type of (implemented) driving mechanism that has been referred to as the Lifting Constraints, Act and Saturate (LCAS) algorithm"
"If the P and R are predefined, the optimal control policy for the agent can be determined efficiently using techniques such as value iteration [12]_CITE"
The Boltzmann exploration [43]_CITE is applied to the Q-learning algorithm
The robotic reaching is also an important topic in developmental robotics [24]_CITE
"The learning algorithm of reaching has been implemented in our previous work, please refer to [8]_CITE for details"
These features fit the findings and the theories from the area of developmental psychology [34]_CITE.
"A typical MRAN network [30]_CITE is expressed as: (4)f(x)= 0+ k=1N k k(x) (5) k(x)=exp(-1 k2 x- k 2)where f(x)=(f1(x),f2(x), ,fNO(x),)T is the network output vector; x is the network input; k is the weight vector from the hidden unit k(x);NO is the number of radial basis function units, and k and k are the kth hidden unit centre and width, respectively"
"However, the robot cannot reach or point at the object yet because the MRAN network has not sufficiently developed its generalisation ability [36]_CITE"
This property fits well with a number of important psychological theories on cognition [42]_CITE
"Regarding the human infant aspect, conventional approaches tend to focusing on building the pointing ability directly, few methods exploit the inspirations from the infant development [40]_CITE"
Current emphasis is on increasing the level of autonomy from pre-programmed path following to autonomous path re-planning to account for unforeseen events [6]_CITE
"There has been much discussion regarding the interpretability of fuzzy systems [9,10]_CITE, although there remains no agreed definition [11]_CITE and consequently it remains a controversial topic [12 14]_CITE"
"Interpretability can be considered as the property that indicates how easily an expert can comprehend the output of the system [13,16]_CITE"
"Unfortunately, it is generally accepted that there is a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability [12,13]_CITE although to further complicate the issue, in some instances over-fitting can lead to rules that are both less interpretable and with lower performance"
"Path planning with obstacle avoidance is intrinsically NP hard [17,18]_CITE"
"Many solution methods have been studied including optimal control [19,20]_CITE, potential fields [21,22]_CITE, graph search [23 25]_CITE, evolutionary algorithms [4,26]_CITE and even manually tuned fuzzy logic controllers [27]_CITE."
"The MILP planner is implemented within Model Predictive Control (MPC) [29 31]_CITE in which the planning problem is repeatedly solved on-line, and only the initial portion of each plan is implemented"
"This approach introduces feedback, to compensate for uncertainty, and can be proven to be stabilising [32]_CITE and to satisfy constraints"
The result is a feedback guidance law for the UAV that ensures obstacle avoidance and offers high performance [5]_CITE
The C4.5 algorithm [37]_CITE extended the range of problems decision trees could solve by proposing a crisp partitioning of continuous attributes
Several fuzzy decision tree methods were proposed [38 41]_CITE to overcome the problems associated with crisp sets but these methods are still limited to classification problems
Breiman et al proposed the CART algorithm [42]_CITE to allow decision trees to be applied to regression problems
Another approach to regression problems was proposed by Lawry et al which combined Quinlan's ID3 algorithm [36]_CITE with label semantics [43]_CITE
"The resulting algorithm, LID3 [44,45]_CITE, has been used to tackle regression problems such as flood and storm surge prediction [46,47]_CITE."
The interpretability of decision tree algorithms has previously been assessed as high [16]_CITE based on properties such as having a consistent rule base with simple and easily comprehensible rules; the rules typically include only a subset of the input variables; the associated membership functions are intuitive to the user (as they must be predefined and are not modified by the learning process)
It offers an inherent model of uncertainty [35]_CITE;
"The model offers good performance, robustness and generalisation [34]_CITE; comparable to other regression algorithms such as Naive-Bayes [48]_CITE, Neural Networks [49]_CITE and Support Vector Machines [44,50]_CITE;"
"The branches of the tree can be interpreted as a set of linguistic rules based on label semantics, thereby improving the interpretability of the tree [16]_CITE;"
"Proposed by Lawry [43]_CITE, Label Semantics is a framework for modelling with linguistic expressions based on labels such as left, ahead, right or very close, close, distant, very distant"
"The result of evaluating the probability of a particular subset of labels, S, for Dx across the population is a distribution on Dx referred to as a mass assignment (see [58]_CITE for details of Mass Assignment theory)"
"Dx can be viewed as a description of x in terms of the labels in LA [44]_CITE, or formally:"
The resulting membership functions can be considered as a strong fuzzy partition [59]_CITE
This section reviews the method proposed by Qin and Lawry [44]_CITE for learning an LDT from data.
An information based heuristic guides attribute selection at each node as in ID3 [36]_CITE but the information measurements are adjusted in accordance with label semantics
"According to Jeffrey's rule [17]_CITE, for a decision tree consisting of branches: (25)P(Ftj|x)= v=1sP(Ftj|Bv)P(Bv|x) and: (26)E(Xt|Ftj)= txtp(xt|Ftj)dxt (27)E(Xt|Ftj)= txtmxt(Ftj)dxt tmxt(Ftj)dxt"
"The problem is explored using a simulation provided by the Group for Aeronautical Research and Technology in Europe, Flight Mechanics Action Group 14 (GARTEUR, FM AG14) [60]_CITE"
This section reviews the method from [5]_CITE for UAV guidance using online MILP.
"The two-norm constraint of (37) is implemented by approximating it with one of a choice of linear constraints, and using binary variables to selectively relax all but one of these as proposed in [28]_CITE and [5]_CITE: (39) {1, ,No}, i {1, ,Nc}, k {1, ,Nk}diT(r(k) rn(k)) Ro c(k,s) Mb(s,i,k) (40) {1, ,No}, k {1, ,Nk} i=1Ncb(s,i,k) Nc 1 where Nc is the number of constraints that the circle is approximated by; M is a positive number that is much larger than any other term in the constraint; b is a set of binary decision variables (0 or 1); and: (41)di=[cos 2 iNcsin 2 iNc]"
"In practice this is limited by the available sensors, however, the MPC MILP approach can be made robust to these limitations by the addition of some simple terminal constraints [66]_CITE"
"Similarly, moving obstacles have previously been addressed in MILP [67]_CITE and could be cloned in the same manner presented here, given appropriate attributes"
The standard LID3 algorithm [44]_CITE (summarised in Section 2.2.2) is based on assumptions about the nature of the data that do not hold given the current problem framework
The linguistic interpretation of each focal element is best expressed in terms clock position [68]_CITE (also indicated on the figure) such that an object directly behind the UAV could be described as being at 6 o'clock
"The number of discontinuities increases as the number of disconnected classes [18]_CITE increases from two in the single obstacle case, left or right of the obstacle, to three in the two obstacle case, left, right or between ( Fig_12 )"
It is well established that extending the tree to near the maximum depth can result in over-fitting the training data leading to poor generalisation [72]_CITE
Fuzzy systems can be considered inherently transparent [9]_CITE as their behaviour can be explained in terms of their components and their relations
"However, the focus on improving accuracy [11,73]_CITE through techniques such as neuro-fuzzy [74]_CITE tended towards models that were unintelligible, ie they could not be understood by a user and lacked interpretability."
Given that there is not even an agreed definition of interpretability [9]_CITE measuring it is even harder [75]_CITE
"This section demonstrates, through the use of examples, that the decision tree controller offers a high degree of interpretability which enables the reasoning behind the controller's decision making to be understood before providing some interpretability measures [76]_CITE typical of the LDTs used in this paper."
"Many taxonomies to compare the interpretability of different algorithms have been proposed [9,10,12,76]_CITE"
"The proposed model makes predictions based on only the range and bearing to the target and two nearest obstacles, ie there are six features in the model which is within the recognized 7 2 distinct conceptual entities most humans can handle [77]_CITE"
"A task is an atomic and well-defined work assignment for an individual or a team ( Bruegge_and_Dutoit,_2009;_Kersten_and_Murphy,_2006_CITE)"
"Tasks can be defined, eg, in issue trackers, in project backlogs, or in to-do lists but can also be informal and loosely defined in emails, personal notes, or in the minds of people ( Maalej, 2009_CITE)."
"For instance, previous studies have shown that task switches are frequent ( Mark_et al.,_2005;_Ko_et al.,_2007;_Maalej,_2009_CITE) and expensive ( Parnin_and_Gorg,_2006;_Iqbal_and_Horvitz,_2007_CITE), as developers get blocked, interrupted, or simply must handle multiple tasks at once"
"With every task switch, developers have to adjust their mindset to the new task ( Mark et al,_2005_CITE) and locate relevant artifacts to work on ( Kersten_and_Murphy_2006_CITE)"
"Predicting related tasks would thus help identify with whom developers should synchronize to handle dependencies, avoid conflicts, and share knowledge ( Blincoe et al,_2013_CITE)."
"A task context consists of all interactions and the concerned artifacts a developer performs to work on a particular task ( Maalej et al,_2014a_CITE)."
"Maalej et al_(2014a_CITE) defines interactions as: the actions (ie the interaction events) taken by a developer, such as the clicks of a specific buttons, the changes to code entities, or views of documentation pages"
"This is typically done by a background process that collects data from various sensors while each sensor captures specific interaction events of the developer with the system ( Maalej_and_Happel,_2008;_Maalej_et al.,_2014a_CITE)"
"The more relevant an artifact is, the better it describes the context and the more likely it contributes to accomplish the task (inspired by Hjorland_and_Sejer Christensen, 2002_CITE)."
"The older our interactions with these objects are, the less important they become for our context ( Maalej, 2010_CITE)"
"A similar concepts called edit wear and read wear was introduced first by Hill et al (1992)_CITE, including the use of time spent on particular lines in a text editor"
The idea of wear was applied to software development by DeLine et al (2005)_CITE to facilitate the understanding of programs through wear-based filtering.
Maalej et al_(2014a_CITE) discuss common interaction types used in recommendation systems and how they can be monitored or processed.
Kersten and_Murphy (2006)_CITE introduced a model called degree-of-interest (DOI) for calculating the relevance of each artifact used in a task
"The decay is proportional to the position in the event stream of the first interaction with the artifact ( Kersten and_Murphy, 2006_CITE)"
"Each selection also leads to decaying the interest values of other artifacts ( Kersten and_Murphy, 2005_CITE)"
"At any point in time, the interest values of the artifacts reflect their relevance ranking to a particular task ( Kersten and_Murphy, 2006_CITE)."
"This ensures that artifacts which have decayed to a negative interest get positive interest values when a developer interacts with them again ( Kersten and_Murphy, 2006_CITE)."
"Kersten and Murphy used the DOI model to filter artifacts irrelevant to the current task ( Kersten and_Murphy, 2006_CITE)"
"Mylyn, a tool which implements this approach for the Eclipse IDE is a standard plugin within the Eclipse community ( The_Eclipse_Foundation,_2011;_BZ_Media_LLC.,_2008_CITE)."
"In contrast, Kersten and_Murphy (2006)_CITE define recency by a decay as mentioned before"
"There are established measures for comparing the similarity of sets and vectors ( Pang-Ning_et_al.,_2006_CITE), which we discuss in the following."
"Mylyn is a task management tool that implements the degree-of-interest (DOI) model ( Kersten and_Murphy, 2006_CITE) for the Eclipse development environment"
"For this we choose 300 because this is often recommended as best-practice for mid-sized documents ( Bradford,_2008;_ eh ek_and_Sojka,_2010_CITE)."
"The study consisted of a series of simulations ( Walker and_Holmes, 2014_CITE) with task data collected from the Bugzilla repository of the Eclipse community"
"We report on the hit ratio, normalized distance performance measure, and mean absolute error, often used to evaluate prediction accuracy ( Shani and_Gunawardana, 2011_CITE)."
"Hit ratios are useful for evaluating recommendation models in particular if the recommendation items are ranked in a given order ( Dumitru et al,_2011_CITE)"
"The hit ratio curves plot the accumulated percentage of correctly retrieved results against the number of recommendations made ( Dumitru_et al.,_2011;_Hariri_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"This finding is consistent with previous studies which showed that developers often encounter difficulties to write a meaningful description for their tasks ( Maalej,_2009;_Maalej_and_Happel,_2010_CITE)"
"Many of the tasks (about half of developers work) are informal and do not have a meaningful text description ( Maalej, 2009_CITE)."
"Additional types of relationships (eg subtask or incorporates) ( Thompson et al,_2016_CITE) should be studied separately"
"Nevertheless, as developers work is often fragmented ( Sanchez et al,_2015_CITE) there is a plenty of ongoing parallel tasks: some defined as tasks with descriptions, some only informal or with quick references"
"LaToza et al (2006)_CITE surveyed Microsoft developers and found that 62% agreed that they have to switch tasks often because of requests from my teammates or manager , more frequently than switching work because the task is blocked"
"Several previous studies (eg Maalej, 2009_CITE and Bachmann et al,_2010_CITE) showed that a large portion of developers work ( 50%) is rather informal and neither strictly defined as task nor assigned in issue trackers and task lists"
"For instance, Bachmann et al (2010)_CITE hired a very experienced Apache developer to analyze committed Apache source code and trace it to bugs/tasks in the project issue tracker"
Maalej (2009)_CITE surveyed 782 professional developers and found very similar results
"These dimensions partly represent the developers mental models ( Singer et al,_1997_CITE)"
"Development work is frequently interrupted requiring developers to switch between tasks back and forth ( Parnin_and_Rugaber,_2011;_Maalej,_2009_CITE)"
"If one would apply the principles of Getting Things Done ( Allen, 2001_CITE) to the domain of software engineering by comparing the contexts of the tasks and recommending the tasks with most similar contexts, this would probably reduce context switches, save time, and increase productivity"
"From a related task, a developer can eg, learn from the discussion what is important to note, where to find additional reference information, or simply whom to ask if one has a questions ( Maalej et al,_2014b_CITE)"
"Predicting related tasks would help identify with whom developers should synchronize to handle dependencies, avoid conflicts, and share knowledge ( Blincoe et al,_2013_CITE)"
"Dragunov et al proposed TaskTracer, a tool that helps multitasking knowledge workers to rapidly resume past activities and restore contexts ( Dragunov et al,_2005_CITE)"
"Similarly, Shen et al introduced a similar tool called TaskPredictor ( Shen et al,_2006_CITE), and later TaskPredictor2 ( Shen et al,_2009_CITE), which both use machine learning approaches to detect task switches and to predict the user current task"
Rattenbury and_Canny (2007)_CITE proposed a task representation and visualization tool called CAAD (Context-Aware Activity Display)
Brdiczka (2010)_CITE propose a similar approach to construct a task representation based on artifact interactions
"The goal is to increase the developer productivity by reducing information overload ( Kersten and_Murphy, 2006_CITE)"
"Switch! ( Maalej and_Sahm, 2010_CITE) is a context-aware artifact recommender, assisting developers in switching artifacts based on interaction history and types of development tasks"
"A similar concept called edit wear and read wear to DOI was introduced first by Hill et al (1992)_CITE, including the use of time spent on particular lines in a text editor"
"With TASKREC, Vo et al aim at recommending relevant tasks for users according to their situation and environment capabilities ( Vo et al,_2009_CITE)"
"Finally, UMEA ( Kaptelinin, 2003_CITE) also monitors user interactions with artifacts"
"For instance, Parnin and_Gorg (2006)_CITE looked at various ways to compute file relevance for a task and used (including recency and frequency)"
Sridhara et al (2008)_CITE discussed six different state-of-the-art similarity techniques applying on software
Grechanik et al (2010)_CITE developed a search engine for solution domains to find highly relevant applications
Jeh and_Widom (2002)_CITE proposed SimRank to measure the similarity of the structural context in which objects occur based on their relationships with other objects
Rastkar and_Murphy (2009)_CITE studied the computed similarity of 700 bug reports from the Eclipse Mylyn project
Rocha et al (2015)_CITE described an approach to predict similar bugs a developer should work on next to reduce context switches
"They used the text descriptions as the summary of the bug and a cosine algorithm to predict a next, similar bug (see also Jalbert and_Weimer, 2008_CITE)"
Alipour et al (2013)_CITE suggested a new approach to find related especially duplicate bugs by using contextual information
Lamkanfi et al (2011)_CITE used four classification algorithms to predict the severity of a bug
"Finally, there is a large body of research about coordination and collaboration issues of development teams, eg, studying developers social networks ( Zanetti et al,_2013_CITE), mining of the revision histories ( Zimmermann, 2009_CITE), or analyzing the text comments of the bug reports ( Runeson et al,_2007_CITE)"
"Perhaps the most related work is of Blincoe et al (2013)_CITE, who analyzed the information needs of developers working on tasks in parallel using the Bugzilla repository"
Ying and_Robillard (2011)_CITE investigated the differences of occurrences of an interaction event (edit) in a programming task
"Recently, Soh et al (2015)_CITE studied noises in context data, and found that Mylyn context data can miss on average about 6% of the time spent performing a task and contain on average about 28% of false edit-events"
Development tasks have a broad variety of task relationships between them ( Thompson et al 2016_CITE)
"We also think that a task recommender will need to consider other information such as the text description, discussions and annotations tasks, as well properties such as the task severity, complexity or simply the level or concentration and remaining work time ( Allen, 2001_CITE)."
"Malware (malicious software) is undoubtedly one of today's greatest threats to the Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability (CIA) triangle of information security ( Stoneburner_et al.,_2002_CITE)"
"In behavior-based malware analysis, they explore traces of malware execution in the form of system call sequences (rules) and frequently occurring subsequences of potentially malicious code ( Egele_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"Their workflow involves the tasks of selecting different rules, categorizing them, and storing them in a database as well as manual adaption and/or tuning of found rules ( Wagner_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"In addition to challenging analysis methods, implicit knowledge ( Chen_et al.,_2009_CITE) or tacit knowledge ( Wang_et al.,_2009_CITE) about the data, the domain experience or prior experience are often required to make sense of the data and not become overwhelmed"
"By externalizing some of the domain experts' implicit knowledge, it can be made available as explicit knowledge and stored in a knowledge database (KDB) ( Chen_et al.,_2009_CITE)."
"Visualization tools provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively ( Munzner,_2014_CITE)"
"Thus, they are particularly useful to augment human capabilities rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods ( Munzner,_2014_CITE)"
"For this, we started with a problem characterization ( Sedlmair_et al.,_2012_CITE) corresponding to the first level of the nested model, whereby we followed a three-step qualitative research approach including systematic literature research, focus group meetings and semi-structured interviews"
"In the semi-structured interviews sessions, it was possible to identify preferred visual representation combinations (eg, multiple views ( Gotz_et al.,_2012_CITE) and arc-diagram ( Wattenberg,_2002_CITE) or word tree ( Wattenberg_and_Viegas,_2008_CITE))"
"There are basically two different approaches for the detection of malicious software: the signature-based and the behavior-based approach ( Dornhackl_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Current malware detection/classification systems commonly use a signature-based approach which describes known malware by simple patterns (eg, defined by regular expressions) or its syntactic characteristics (mostly bit strings) ( Christodorescu_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"In general, the signature-based detection approach has several shortcomings ( Christodorescu_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"Behavior-based malware recognition: Malicious behavior in software is identified through static or dynamic analysis ( Egele_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"Dynamic analysis, on the other hand, observes the sample's behavior directly ( Egele_et al.,_2008_CITE): The supposed malware sample is executed inside an isolated, sometimes virtualized laboratory environment, which is instrumented with selected data providers, in order to generate a report (ie trace) of system and API calls sequentially invoked by the sample"
"Pattern extraction process: The behavior pattern extraction process (see Fig_3 ) is usually split into several stages ( Wagner_et al.,_2014_CITE) and can be based on different data providers ( Wagner_et al.,_2015_CITE)"
"In this section we define terms related to the malware analysis process ( Fig_3) ( Dornhackl_et al.,_2014;_Wagner_et al.,_2014_CITE):"
"Task-grammar: An identified relevant rule, stored in the KDB assigned to a task of the malicious behavior schema ( Dornhackl_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"The users are malware analysts (domain experts) whose main tasks are to select different rules, categorize them by their task and store them in the database as well as manual adaption and/or tuning of found rules ( Wagner_et al.,_2014_CITE)."
"This includes detailed information about the contained rules ( Wagner_et al.,_2014_CITE) in the form of a directed acyclic graph with nominal attributes."
"In a preliminary study, we found that malware analysts preferred visualization concepts containing multiple views and arc-diagrams or word trees ( Wagner_et al.,_2014_CITE)."
"By externalizing and storing of the experts' implicit knowledge ( Chen_et al.,_2009_CITE), it can be made system-internally available as computerized knowledge to support further analysis or other analysts."
"Two of them were malware analysts who were also involved in the previous focus group for problem characterization and abstraction ( Wagner_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"One example is RelEx ( Sedlmair_et al.,_2012_CITE), a design study with automotive engineers to optimize in-car communication networks"
"Other than that, Pretorius_and_Van_Wijk_(2009)_CITE point out that it is important for visualization designers to ask themselves: What does the user want to see? and What do the data want to be? as well as how these two points mutually enhance one another"
"In the problem domain of cyber security, Fink_et al._(2009)_CITE developed a set of visualization design principles with a focus on high-resolution displays and presented prototypes according to these design principles"
Goodall_et al._(2004)_CITE conducted contextual interviews to gain a better understanding of the intrusion detection workflow and proposed a three-phased model in which tasks could be decoupled by necessary know-how to provide more flexibility for organizations in training new analysts
Conti_(2007)_CITE dedicated a part of his book to visualization for malware detection but focused on the network level
Lee_et al._(2011)_CITE proposed a context-specific variant of scatter plots to classify malware by properties extracted using a signature-based approach
Dornhackl_et al._(2014)_CITE introduced a workflow for malware pattern extraction
"In 2015, Wagner_et al._(2015)_CITE presented a survey on visualization systems for malware analysis"
"On the one hand, there are systems for Individual Malware Analysis which support the analysis of a single malware sample to gain new insights (eg, Donahue_et al.,_2013;_W chner_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"On the other hand, there are systems for Malware Classification which support the comparison of many samples to identify the common behavior (eg, Gove_et al.,_2014;_Han_et al.,_2014;_Long_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"For example, W chner_et al._(2014)_CITE proposed the interactive DAVAST system for the detection and analysis of email worm attacks"
"Additionally, Gove_et al._(2014)_CITE introduced SEEM , which allows the behavioral comparison of a large set of malware samples in relation to the imported DLLs and callback domains."
"In particular, we integrated a set of well-known visualization techniques for the IT-security community and integrated a KDB structured by the malicious behavior scheme ( Dornhackl_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Thus, KAMAS will contribute to the emerging topic of knowledge-assisted visualization ( Chen_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Some problem-oriented projects (eg, Mistelbauer_et al.,_2012_CITE) and general frameworks (eg, Tominski,_2011_CITE) integrate explicit knowledge in visualization but not in a form similar to malware behavior patterns."
"Therefore, we set up a design study project to find a visualization solution that followed a user-centered design process ( Sharp_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
"We iteratively produced sketches, screen prototypes, and functional prototypes ( Kulyk_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
"Furthermore, the graphical summary is based on the Gestalt principle of similarity ( Johnson,_2014_CITE) in order to support the analyst in quickly recognizing related call combinations"
"Interaction concept: For a better understanding of its functionality, we describe KAMAS according to five steps based on the visual information seeking mantra by Shneiderman_(1992)_CITE: overview first, rearrange and filter, details-on-demand, then extract and analyze further"
"Input data: In general, the input data are sequences of system and API calls which are logged during the execution of malware samples in protected laboratory environments ( Wagner_et al.,_2015_CITE) as described in Section 2"
"All of the insights were documented in detail to ensure reproducibility ( Smuc_et al.,_2015_CITE) and used to improve our research prototype"
"Basically, the dynamic query features ( Ahlberg_et al.,_1992_CITE) were described as being very useful"
"It lasted one hour on average and encompassed five analysis tasks, the system usability scale questionnaire (SUS) ( Brooke,_1996_CITE), and a semi-structured interview"
"The SUS is a standardized, technology-independent questionnaire to evaluate the usability of a system ( Brooke,_1996_CITE)"
"To achieve the best outcome, we asked the participants to apply thinking aloud ( Nielsen,_1993_CITE)"
"In parallel, the prototype logged user interactions using EvalBench ( Aigner_et al.,_2013_CITE) (see Fig_4.1.b) and the facilitator took notes in our pre-defined test guideline."
Sauro_(2011)_CITE compared 500 SUS scores and identified the average score as 68 points
"These comments were also apparent concerning SUS question ten: I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system ( Brooke,_1996_CITE), with a score of 50%"
"Categorization of KAMAS: If we categorize KAMAS along the Malware Visualization Taxonomy ( Wagner_et al.,_2015_CITE), we can see that KAMAS can be categorized on the one hand as a Malware Forensics tool which regards to the analysis of malicious software execution traces"
"Lessons learned: During this design study, we learned that explicit knowledge opens the possibility to close the gap between different categories of malware analysis systems ( Wagner_et al.,_2015_CITE)"
"On a general level, the workflow for knowledge generation and extraction is mostly similar and always includes the system user as an integral part of the loop ( Endert_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"[1]_CITE, whilst total spending worldwide is anticipated to continue flourishing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 17.7% until 2016 [2]_CITE."
It was anecdotally reported that the number of servers owned by some major Cloud service providers and operators could be more than a million [3]_CITE
"They are hosted in Cloud DCs, each typically housing tens of thousands of servers [4]_CITE"
"In order to be sustainable, the significant capital outlay required for building a DC makes maximisation of Return on Investment (RoI) crucial, which in turn necessitates efficient and adaptive resource usage of the virtualised physical infrastructure [5 7]_CITE"
"Recent research has revealed that DC workload patterns at coarse time-scales (ie, hours) exhibit weekend/weekday variations [8]_CITE, but at finer-grained timescales, the workload patterns are bursty and unpredictable [6,9,10]_CITE"
"For spatial granularity, individual flows size, server availability, network link utilisation, etc., need to be measured and used as additional input to resource provisioning algorithms [10]_CITE."
"Currently, to cope with performance variability and unpredictability, DCs are engineered to tolerate a certain degree of demand fluctuation by over-provisioning, or by holding certain resources as a reserve [11,12]_CITE"
"However, over-provisioning within Cloud DCs is expensive [4]_CITE"
"These two pillars not only represent the most costly infrastructural elements, up to 60% of the cost of a data centre [4]_CITE, that need to be managed and provisioned in an efficient and effective manner, they also adequately capture the level of granularity of resource contention and multiplexing over Cloud DCs [13]_CITE"
"Conventional DC architectures are built on tree-like hierarchy with high-density, high-cost hardware [14]_CITE, as depicted in Fig_1 a"
"To make the network fabric cost-effective, higher layer links are typically oversubscribed by factors of 10:1 to 80:1, limiting the bandwidth between servers in different branches [4]_CITE"
"To increase capacity, network operators must resolve to vertical expansion, in which operators replace overloaded switches with higher-cost, higher capacity ones [15]_CITE."
"Modern data centre architectures [6,16,17]_CITE have been proposed to reduce or even remove oversubscription altogether"
"Representative work, such as eg, Clos-Tree [6]_CITE and Fat-Tree [16]_CITE, promote horizontal rather than the traditional vertical expansion"
"In Clos-tree topology, as shown in Fig_1b, links between the core layer switches and the aggregation layer switches form a complete bipartite graph [6]_CITE"
"Clos/Fat-tree architectures have seen an increasing popularity in modern data centres to achieve high performance and resiliency through their ability to provide better scalability and path diversity than conventional DC topologies [18,19]_CITE"
Such radical upgrades are typically prohibitively expensive and time-consuming [20]_CITE.
Both BCube and DCell come with custom routing protocols to take advantage of topological properties [23]_CITE
"According to [22]_CITE, a high-level DCell is constructed from low-level DCells (DCell k, k 0) in a recursive manner"
A BCube 1 is comprised of n BCube 0 and n n-port switches [21]_CITE
"That is, two neighbouring servers that connect to the same level i switch are different at the ith digit [21]_CITE."
[25]_CITE reports that management traffic can account to approximately 5 10% of the bandwidth during normal operating conditions
"With the recent advent of Software Defined Networking (SDN) [26]_CITE, a paradigm that logically centralises and separates the network control from the data plane, the management network is tightly coupled with the control plane as control decisions must be transmitted between the switches and a central controller"
It is possible to mitigate hindrance to management traffic from production traffic through Quality of Service (QoS) enforcement to prioritise management traffic over data traffic [27]_CITE
"In a logical OOB network, the core of the network is still shared between management and production traffic, but logical isolation is achieved using VLANs or dedicated OpenFlow forwarding rules [28]_CITE"
"In such environments, a different physical network is dedicated to management operations [25,29]_CITE."
The cost of servers in data centres can account up to 45% of running cost per year [4]_CITE
"However, server utilisation in DCs can be as low as 10% [30]_CITE due to over-provisioning as a result of the desire to provision for peak demand [31]_CITE."
"First, it is difficult for DC operators and customers to plan in advance for diurnal usage patterns, unpredictable spikes in user and traffic demand, and evolving workloads [9]_CITE"
"Second, it is very expensive, if not impossible, for both of providers and consumers (who have little control and choice [32]_CITE) to configure individual servers so that fine-grained resources, such as, eg, CPU, memory, storage and network, perfectly match temporal application requirements due to the heterogeneity of servers (ie, servers have different CPU, RAM and other resource capacities) and the complexity associated with calculating individual resource requirements for different services [33]_CITE"
"Third, increasing server utilisation by scheduling multiple services on one physical host can cause severe performance degradation due to resource (eg CPU, Memory, Storage and I/O peripheral) contention [34,34,35]_CITE"
"Typically, in order to meet SLA requirements, resources are over-provisioned to meet worst-case demand [36]_CITE."
"In fact, some production software such as VMware vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) [44]_CITE, Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) [45]_CITE, and Citrix XenServer [46]_CITE offer VM consolidation as one of their major features."
"Sandpiper [39]_CITE is a tool that detects and mitigates hotspots based on physical machine resources such as CPU, network and memory"
Entropy [53]_CITE achieves optimal VM configuration while also ensures that every VM has access to sufficient memory and allocated CPU share
"Similar to Sandpiper, ReCon [51]_CITE exploits servers historical resource usage to discover applications that can be consolidated and recommends a dynamic consolidation plan that can be deployed in a multi-cluster data centre"
"In contrast to optimising resources as complete units in aforementioned works, multi-resource schedulable unit (MRSU) [54]_CITE breaks CPU, memory, storage and network into small chunks to tackle resource-overallocation problem at fine granularity"
"While VirtualPower only optimises energy efficiency on individual hosts, pMapper is a controller that places an application onto the most appropriate physical server in order to optimise energy and migration costs, while still meeting some performance guarantees [41]_CITE"
"Subsequent works [33,56]_CITE focused on analysing real data centre application traces, and revealed that there are sufficient variations and correlations amongst applications to be exploited for improving power saving"
"In contrast to pMapper, Mistral [42]_CITE is a system that emphasises on the optimisation of transient power/performance costs"
"A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contract that sets the expectations, usually in measurable terms, between the consumer and service provider [57]_CITE"
"Infrastructure SLA is established between infrastructure (IaaS) providers and service providers to guarantee sufficient resource and uptime whilst service SLA is established between service providers and their customers and is typically measured in QoS metrics such as application response time: for example, maximum response time of 100 ms with minimal throughput of 100 transactions per second [57,58]_CITE"
"Bobroff et al [36]_CITE propose a dynamic resource allocation algorithm for virtualised server environments to maximise the global utilisation of the data centre, while not violating SLAs (ie, VM CPU time guarantee) as a result of performance degradation due to overloading"
Breitgand et al [43]_CITE present a Elastic Service Placement Problem (ESPP)
"Wang et al [50]_CITE, as an extension with dynamic traffic to [48]_CITE, propose a VM consolidation scheme to match known bandwidth demands to server capacity limit"
"Biran et al [47]_CITE described a minimisation problem to determine the location of VMs in a data centre based on the network bandwidth, CPU, and memory resources"
"Today Cloud DCs are no longer places that house a large number of co-located servers, rather, they can be seen as a massive warehouse-scale computer [30]_CITE"
"It is therefore crucial that any resource management and optimisation scheme takes the network performance into consideration [13,47,48,50,59 61]_CITE."
"For the majority of applications hosted over Cloud environments (eg, web-indexing, distributed data analysis, video processing, scientific computing), data is continuously transmitted over the network to support distributed processing and storage as well as server-to-server communication [63]_CITE"
"Yet, the increased oversubscription ratios from bottom to the top of prominent multi-root tree network architectures can result in poor server-to-server connectivity hindering application performance [6,16]_CITE."
"Research has demonstrated that supporting protocols have failed to leverage topological advantages of new scale-out architectures [64,65]_CITE"
"Resource fragmentation can become a performance barrier in DC, resulting in low server utilisation and therefore lower RoI [4,6,9,16]_CITE."
"However, achieving such provisioning using existing legacy mechanisms is faced with two fundamental challenges: First, estimating network load based on historical traffic demands (ie, predictions) is dubious, since these change rapidly in DC environments and different patterns emerge over diverse timescales [9]_CITE"
"Second, existing routing protocols such as ECMP fail to support dynamic applications since they are load-agnostic and operate solely on packet header contents [8,15]_CITE."
"In a DC network, ToR Traffic Matrices (TM)s are sparse with significant locality characteristics, since a few ToRs exchange most data with just few other ToRs [68]_CITE"
"Although a significant fraction of traffic appears to be localised inside a rack, congestion does occur in various layers of the infrastructure despite sufficient capacity being available elsewhere that could be used to alleviate hotspots [8]_CITE"
"Congestion, when it happens, is shown to deteriorate application performance by reducing server-to-server I/O throughput [9]_CITE"
"Flow inter-arrival times vary from 1 flow per 15 ms to 100 flows per millisecond at servers and Top-of-Rack switches, respectively, while on average, there are 10 concurrent flows per server active at any given time [6,9,69]_CITE"
"Finally, DC traffic patterns change rapidly and maintain their unpredictability over multiple timescales (as opposed to legacy Internet workloads), mainly due to the unpredictable dynamics of external user requests as a result of resource sharing, and the multiplexing of traffic at the level of individual flows, as opposed to large traffic aggregates [6]_CITE."
"Studies have demonstrated that network redundancy cannot completely mask all failures, implicitly pointing to the inefficiency of ECMP [66]_CITE"
"Such hashing causes flow collisions that saturates switch buffers and deteriorates overall switch utilisation, resulting in reduction in the network bandwidth [15]_CITE"
"Moreover, MicroTE [10]_CITE has tested ECMP with real DC traffic traces and found that ECMP achieves only 80 85% of optimal performance that can be obtained by solving a linear program with the objective of minimising the Maximum Link Utilisation (MLU), assuming full prior knowledge of the traffic matrix every second"
"The implication of such inefficiency is that, while most of the links in measured DC networks have relatively low utilisation, a small but significant fraction of links appear to be persistently congested [8,9]_CITE"
Hedera [15]_CITE is a centralised TE mechanism aiming to resolve ECMP inability to fully utilise network bandwidth
"In contrast to only scheduling large flows, VL2 [6]_CITE uses Valiant Load Balancing to randomise packet forwarding on a per-flow basis"
"MicroTE [10]_CITE is a fine-grained TE approach for DCs that achieves traffic adaptation by exploiting the short-term and partial predictability of the DC traffic demands, to attain overall better link utilisation than ECMP"
"However, unpredictable nature of traffic pattern in production DCs [6]_CITE puts MicroTE usability under question."
The Modified Penalizing Exponential Flow-spliTing (MPEFT) [67]_CITE implemented and evaluated an online version of PEFT [74]_CITE to provide close to optimal TE for a variety of DC topologies by both shortest and non-shortest paths with exponential penalisation
"It is estimated that amongst each Watt consumed, IT equipment takes about 59% of the share, 33% is attributed to cooling, and 8% is due to power distribution loss [4]_CITE"
"For example, some schemes use as few network devices as possible to provide the routing service without compromising network performance [75]_CITE"
ElasticTree [76]_CITE is such an optimiser
High-bandwidth Ultra-Low Latency (HULL) [77]_CITE is an architecture that is designed for delivering predictable ultra-low latency and high bandwidth utilisation in a DC environment
"In order to achieve this goal, HULL uses a combination of three technique: It uses Phantom Queues, which simulate the occupancy of a queue that drains at less than the maximum link rate, adaptive response to ECN marks using DCTCP [71]_CITE, and packet pacing to smooth out bursts of packet arrivals"
"From both testbed and simulation experiments, it is reported that HULL mitigates tail latency by a factor of up to 10 40% through trading off network work throughput [77]_CITE"
Preemptive Distributed Quick (PDQ) [78]_CITE flow scheduling is a network protocol designed to improve flow completion time in order to meet deadlines
"The PDQ switches share a common flow comparator, which assesses flow criticality in order to approximate a range of scheduling disciplines [78]_CITE"
DeTail [69]_CITE is a cross-layer scheme for cutting the tail of flow completion faced by DC network traffic flows
Fastpass [79]_CITE is a logically centralised arbiter which allows end hosts to send at line-rate while eliminating congestion at switches
"Silo [80]_CITE provide cloud applications guaranteed network bandwidth, guaranteed packet delay and guaranteed burst allowance in order to ensure predictable network latency for their messages"
"Joseph et al [81]_CITE proposed PLayer, a policy-aware switching layer for DCs consisting of inter-connected policy-aware switches ( pswitches)"
"Vyas et al [82]_CITE proposed a middlebox architecture, CoMb, to actively consolidate middlebox features and improve middlebox utilization, reducing the number of required middleboxes for operational environments"
"Policy-Aware Application Cloud Embedding (PACE) [83]_CITE is a framework to support application-wide, in-network policies, and other realistic requirements such as bandwidth and reliability"
Recent developments in SDN enable more flexible middlebox deployments over the network while still ensuring that specific subsets of traffic traverse the desired set of middleboxes [84]_CITE
"Kazemian et al [85]_CITE presented NetPlumber, a real-time policy-checking tool with sub-millisecond average run-time per rule update, and evaluated it on three production networks including Google SDN, the Stanford backbone and Internet2"
"Zafar et al [86]_CITE proposed SIMPLE, a SDN-based policy enforcement scheme to steer DC traffic in accordance to policy requirements"
"Similarly, Fayazbakhsh et al presented FlowTags [87]_CITE to leverage SDN global network visibility and guarantee correctness of policy enforcement"
SYNC [88]_CITE and PLAN [89]_CITE study the impact of correct policy implementation in the dynamic VM migration environment where change of end-point could imply violation of network policies
"In some cases, however, selecting a non-shortest path can be advantageous for avoiding congestion or routing around a faulty path/node [67]_CITE"
"In comparison, Baatdaat [90]_CITE and MPEFT [67]_CITE opportunistically include non-shortest paths for packet forwarding"
"Hence, the routing algorithm might consider non-shortest paths constrained by no more than n hops longer than the shortest path in practice because it does not significantly increase computation complexity [90]_CITE."
Measurement-based traffic engineering techniques such as Baatdaat [90]_CITE and MPEFT [67]_CITE can play an essential role in response to the immediate load fluctuations
"In contrast to reactive traffic engineering such as MicroTE [10]_CITE, Baatdaat employs a measure- avoid- adapt proactive control scheme based on network programmability"
It is shown in [90]_CITE that direct measurement of link utilisation can help make better flow scheduling decisions which result in considerable improvement in maximum link utilisation
TCP is currently the most widely-used transport protocol carrying about 85% of the traffic on the Internet [91]_CITE and over Cloud DCs
"Under these characteristics, TCP is known to under-utilise network bandwidth, leading in some cases to low throughput and high latency [92,93]_CITE"
"To improve throughput, large buffers have been used throughout the network reducing the number of retransmissions, however large buffers cause side effects such as long latencies, traffic synchronisation as well as preventing congestion avoidance algorithms to react promptly to congestion events, leading to buffer-bloat [94]_CITE"
"Most typical DC workloads such as search engines, data mining or distributed file systems, follow the partition-aggregate paradigm where the work is distributed amongst multiple machines and once each machine has computed a partial result, this is aggregated back into a single point [8]_CITE"
"These large flows are throughput-sensitive, bound by overall long completion times [8,71]_CITE"
Partition-aggregate patterns generate bursts of ON-OFF traffic that can cause packets to be dropped or delayed [8]_CITE
"The low throughput under bursts of flows and many-to-one communication is referred to as Throughput Incast Collapse [70,72,92]_CITE"
"Due to this issue, Facebook reportedly switched to UDP in order to have tighter control over the congestion mechanisms and avoid the adverse impact of TCP on achievable throughput [71]_CITE"
"Facebook implemented a UDP sliding window mechanism, with a window size inverse proportional to the number of concurrent flows to solve incast collapse when receiving memcache responses, halving the request time [95]_CITE"
"A TCP enhancement, GIP [72]_CITE, has recently been proposed to remedy TCP incast throughput collapse"
Data Center TCP (DCTCP) [71]_CITE leverages ECN in modern DCs to provide a multi-bit feedback from a single-bit stream
"To calculate the rate of transmission, D 3 measures the number of flows traversing the interface using flow initiation and termination packets (SYN and FIN) [96]_CITE"
"However, it has been shown in [97]_CITE that D 3 can make unfair bandwidth allocations."
"The Rate Control Protocol (RCP) [98]_CITE and the Variable-Structure congestion Control Protocol (VCP) [99]_CITE aim to estimate link congestion and avoid queue build-up, minimise flow completion time while being TCP-friendly"
"One recent proposal to tackle latency is TIMELY [100]_CITE, which reconsiders the applicability of (round trip time) RTT to estimate queue occupancy"
The issue with TCP is that it is complicated to keep high throughput with low buffer occupancy [71]_CITE
"Recently, with the wide deployment of Software Defined Networking (SDN) especially within DC networks [101]_CITE, the current state of the network can be aggregated at a single or a hierarchy of controllers, and subsequently be used to distribute network knowledge to the end hosts in short timescales [28]_CITE"
"Amazon, Google, and Microsoft showed a loss in revenue when response time increased by 100 ms, creating a soft real-time constraint on the mice flows [102]_CITE"
"In comparison, Omniscient TCP (OTCP) [73,103]_CITE tackles this by exploiting SDN to tune TCP parameters for the operating environment."
Cloud operators often assume high similarity between the two environments and hence employ similar resource management principles static resource admission and over-provisioning [15]_CITE
"The consequent demand is therefore highly unpredictable over both short and long timescales and DC operators need to respond to rapidly-changing usage patterns, as it has been demonstrated in a number of Cloud DC measurement studies [10,90]_CITE."
"For example, Hedera [15]_CITE uses OpenFlow to detect large flows in the network, estimate their demand and compute non-conflicting paths for them"
"For example, adaptive and Dynamic Multi-path Computation Framework (ADMPCF) [108]_CITE uses a large set of historical data to analyse and extract features from traffic flows, which in turn are used to improve resource utilisation and mitigate congestion with guarantee on QoS"
"It is shown that these algorithms can achieve near-optimal performance because when the resource requirement is relatively static, the collected set of sample when the resource usages deviate significantly from the anticipated normal behaviour (eg, flash crowds, newly launched services, etc.), the resulting resource allocation can perform poorly [10,109]_CITE"
"Along with prediction-based provisioning, a more conservative yet costly provisioning approach is to over-provision resources to pre-empt peak demand [110]_CITE."
"Using measurements can remove the need for the complicated, and incomplete models of resource demand [112]_CITE"
"In order to capture the rapidly varying user demand, the measurement intervals need to be small enough to characterise instantaneous change in user demand and resource utilisation [90]_CITE"
"The measurement process also needs to be fine-grained in order to measure resource usage at the same level as resources are leased, eg, per-VM, per flow, per net-block [113]_CITE and then be able to shape admission as necessary."
"Resource provisioning for converged infrastructures is managed by a number of control loops at the routing [6,15,16,21,22]_CITE, transport [116]_CITE, and virtual machine (VM) [39,41,42]_CITE layers"
"An alternative is to also consider topological constraints such as aggregation links capacity alongside conformance to server utilisation limits but this, currently, is still done using static information [49,50,113]_CITE."
"However, transient congestion is manageable if it can be detected and if alternate network paths can be exploited in short timescales [69]_CITE"
"For example, DCTCP [71]_CITE and HULL [77]_CITE can improve overall flow completion time to some extent but they are still unable to overcome the uneven load balancing as a result of static flow hashing due to lack of a global view of the link redundancy in the DC network, and hence still suffer from performance degradation"
DC networks will play a central role in the overall performance of Cloud computing environments since they provide the central nervous system for information exchange between cooperating tasks [117]_CITE
"Moreover, the increased flattening of the Internet graph and the penetration of large-scale peering through public Internet exchanges, implies that end-users are only a few AS-hops away from any Cloud service provider and, therefore, the network-internal performance of these converged infrastructures becomes a significant contributor to the end-to-end service time [118]_CITE."
"At the same time, centralising the entirety of control algorithms can be detrimental: not only this would introduce new system vulnerabilities such as single points of failure, in some cases centralised computation of globally-optimal allocation problems is even computationally infeasible [60]_CITE."
"Using an abstract high level language such as P4 [119]_CITE and a fast network oriented instruction set such as (e)BPF [120]_CITE to replace traditional match-action pipeline in switches, custom monitoring and telemetry modules could be available without performance impact on the network"
"This structure controls the sensation of hearing and balance, and an understanding of the anatomy and anatomical variability plays an important part in utilizing the full potential of Cochlear Implants [30]_CITE"
"Detailed anatomical models have interesting patient-specific applications as they can provide information about the type of electrode design that suits the anatomy of the user [29]_CITE, or by allowing improvements to the implant programming based on simulations mimicking the actual anatomical and physiological situation [6]_CITE."
"On average, the cochlea winds 2.6 turns [9]_CITE but can approach up to three full turns corresponding to a difference in the order of 1 2 mm following the path of the spiral"
"For example, local tissue rigidity can be enforced in specified areas [23]_CITE, or conditions of incompressibility or volume-preservation can be applied [20]_CITE"
In the work of [3]_CITE an articulated skeleton model was pre-registered to intra-mouse data studies in order to recover large pose-differences between data acquisitions
"Skeletonization of a volume or surface is a research field in itself [7,22]_CITE"
"The use of skeleton similarity in image registrations should be applicable to many different problems and there are many published methods and approaches for finding and matching the skeletons for differing types of data and geometries [24,26]_CITE"
"Skeleton correspondence has been seen in image registration tasks before, relating to for instance 2D/3D multi-modal registration [15]_CITE and matching of vessels in time-series angiography data [27]_CITE"
"More related to our approach is the work of [25]_CITE, where multiple different shape features were calculated from surface objects and transformed into vector-valued 2D feature images, which were aligned with a classic image registration formulation"
Image segmentation: The border of the inner ear was segmented in all datasets semi-automatically using ITK-SNAP [31]_CITE
"A surface model was generated for each dataset using Marching Cubes [16]_CITE followed by a surface reconstruction [19]_CITE to obtain a well-formed triangular mesh ( Fig_1, right)."
"Initial experimentation showed that methods for automatically finding the curved skeleton [7]_CITE, medial curve or centerlines [5]_CITE tended to be attracted to the larger of the two scalae and thus creating inconsistent skeletons across samples"
"Medial surface representations [12,28]_CITE were also found challenging to generate with desirable topological consistency and smoothness"
The term PBE is the energy bending regularization used to penalize strong changes and foldings in the transformation [21]_CITE
Choosing a fluid- or optical flow-based model [18]_CITE could potentially be more suited for this kind of spiral anatomy
"Following the consecutive application of layers, the unbound powder is removed, and the 3D part is produced [13 17]_CITE"
"In recent years, many reports have been made on the 3DP fabrication of BTE scaffolds, and its critical process factors and parameters [18 22]_CITE"
"These characteristics are related to the process parameters and can be improved with proper adjustment [4,19,20,23 25]_CITE."
"In the context of the 3DP process optimization for improving the performance of the prototype, the soft computing method is a promising approach to monitor and model the process based on physical understanding and experimental data [26]_CITE."
The AANN algorithm is one of the well-known variants of the neural networks models which has been used in many engineering applications [41 45]_CITE
The predominance of AANN for modeling multi-output phenomena is reported in many studies [46]_CITE
Zhou et al [46]_CITE applied a simple genetic algorithm (named GASEN) and showed that GASEN could generate an aggregated neural network with a far smaller size and stronger generalization ability compared with other common techniques
"In another study, they developed a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm as a high-level heuristic algorithm and a well-known back propagation method called quasi Newton training as a low-level heuristic algorithm for optimizing the structure of AANN [47]_CITE"
"Previous studies show that among the various process parameters, the printing direction (axial direction aligned with the x, y, and z directions of the printing build-bed) of a part seems to have the greatest impact [25,50]_CITE"
The adequate pore size for BTE is generally reported to be in range 100 800 m for cell attachment and vascularization [51]_CITE
"The typical layer thickness is generally at least twice the powder particle size dimension, which is approximately 100 m [3,52]_CITE"
"Therefore, one of the important factors for building the tiny pore size of engineered scaffolds is layer thickness [18,19]_CITE"
"Mechanical features may also be affected, and thus another important factor is stability of the pre-deposit powder layer during the reaction between powder and binder [53,54]_CITE"
"Therefore, a trade-off exists between these two requirements [56]_CITE."
"Therefore, recent studies have been devoted to fault detection and diagnosis using multivariate statistical state monitoring (MSPM) methods, eg, principle component analysis (PCA) [8,22,24,35]_CITE, independent component analysis (ICA) [21,30,37,43]_CITE, and so on"
"According to Hyv a rinen and Oja [21]_CITE, non-Gaussianity reflects independence; hence, the ICA method can select its independent components (ICs) by maximizing non-Gaussianity, and can therefore address non-Gaussian data"
"By augmenting the previous observations of variables, Ku et al [25]_CITE developed a dynamic PCA (DPCA) method that can monitor processes with dynamic features"
"Based upon Ku method, many dynamic methods have been proposed, eg, dynamic ICA (DICA) methods [1,14,29]_CITE"
"Ku lag selection method is used in almost all dynamic statistical monitoring methods, except for the lag selection method proposed by Rato and Reis [32]_CITE"
"The PCA-based method uses only lower order statistics (order 2), and ignores the higher order statistics (order > 2) that can extract more information of a process, especially for non-Gaussian processes [9,18,34]_CITE"
"(8) and (10), the mixed matrix can be obtained (14)A=PT 1/2BBy applying the average value criterion to the norms of the column A [38,39]_CITE, d(d There are three dominant reasons for why conventional statistical state monitoring methods, such as ICA, do not have a good ability to monitor non-Gaussian processes"
"In contrast, the HCA method developed by Wang et al [41]_CITE can handle non-Gaussian processes by augmenting higher-order statistics in monitoring indices"
"While, in the HCA method, the sampled third-order cumulant of the pth IC at sample point k is defined as follows [17]_CITE: (17)hsp(k)=sp(k)sp(k 1)sp(k 2)where hsp denotes the cumulative effect of three continuous samples of the pth IC, sp( k) is the pth IC at sample points kwhich has been defined in Eq (4)"
"Many statistical state monitoring methods, such as ICA, are static, which means they only consider the cross-correlations between the observations [24]_CITE"
"When processes contain moving average terms (MA) , they will be approximated by AR model [25]_CITE"
Ku et al [25]_CITE suggested a method of determining the lag structure that was applied in the DPCA method by analyzing the singular value of the covariance matrix of the data
"In contribution analysis based fault diagnosis method [2]_CITE, the contribution of a variable to a monitoring index can be defined as follows: (31)Index= i=1nContiindexwhere Contiindexdenotes the contribution of the ith variable to the Index ( HEor HS)"
The calculation of Contiindexin HCA method has been developed by Wang et al [25]_CITE
"In order to evaluate the monitoring performance of the proposed DHCA method, several experiments for comparison between the proposed methods and other monitoring methods are conducted by implementing these methods on the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process, which was developed by Downs and Vogel [12]_CITE"
"In this study, only 33 variables are monitored since the 19 composition measurements are difficult to measure in real time and one manipulated variable, the agitation speed, is not manipulated [7]_CITE"
One should note that the DICA method with a single order is that proposed by Lee et al [29]_CITE
"The DICA and DHCA methods using the structure of a single number of time lags are termed DICAs and DHCAs, and 18 ICs are selected by applying the average value criterion [38]_CITE to the norms of the columns of the mixed matrix A from all 25 ICs"
"All of their control limits are based on the confidence limit of 99%, which is calculated by the kernel density estimation [31]_CITE"
Auger and Hansen [3]_CITE developed a performance evaluation method to compare the performances of different algorithms
"Hu et al [19]_CITE utilized Auger method to assess the performances of many optimization methods, and, in that study, the success rate (SR) was defined as: (41)SR=numberofsuccessfulrunstotalnumberofrunsIn this work, similarly to the SR, an evaluation method to assess the performance of the six methods mentioned previously in order to give a more clear judgment of their performance"
"According to various publications [1,2]_CITE, thermal errors represent approximately 70% of the total positioning error of the CNC machine tool"
Spindle drift is often considered to be the major error component among them [1]_CITE
The first uses numerical analysis techniques such as the finite-element method [4]_CITE and finite-difference method [5]_CITE
Chen et al [6]_CITE used a multiple regression analysis (MRA) model for thermal error compensation of a horizontal machining centre
Yang et al [14]_CITE also used the MRA model to form an error synthesis model which merges both the thermal and geometric errors of a lathe
"Chen et al [7]_CITE proposed an ANN model structured with 15 nodes in the input layer, 15 nodes in the hidden layer, and six nodes in the output layer in order to drive a thermal error compensation of the spindle and lead-screws of a vertical machining centre"
Wang [13]_CITE used a neural network trained by a hierarchy-genetic-algorithm (HGA) in order to map the temperature variation against the thermal drift of the machine tool
"Wang [10]_CITE also proposed a thermal model merging Grey system theory GM(1,m) and an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)"
"Eskandari et al [15]_CITE presented a method to compensate for positional, geometric, and thermally induced errors of three-axis CNC milling machine using an offline technique"
"Engineering judgment, thermal mode analysis, stepwise regression and correlation coefficient have been used to select the location of temperature sensors for thermal error compensation models [3]_CITE"
"Yan et al [14]_CITE proposed an MRA model combing two methods, namely the direct criterion method and indirect grouping method; both methods are based on the synthetic Grey correlation"
Jan Han et al [16]_CITE proposed a correlation coefficient analysis and fuzzy c-means clustering for selecting temperature sensors both in their robust regression thermal error model and ANN model [17]_CITE; the number of thermal sensors was reduced from thirty-two to five
"However, such models that are based only on expert knowledge may suffer from a loss of accuracy due to engineering assumptions [8]_CITE"
This can be achieved by using a number of methods such as grid partitioning or the subtractive clustering method [18]_CITE
"A number of MATLAB functions have been developed to enhance this accuracy, including averaging the images to reduce pixel noise, alignment of images and extraction from the temperature data by averaging groups of pixels at a specific point [19]_CITE."
"It is most significant advantage is that it needs a small amount of experimental data for accurate prediction, and the requirement for the data distribution is also low [25]_CITE"
"The Grey model GM (h, N) is based on the Grey system theory, where h is the order of the difference equation and N is the number of variables [26]_CITE"
MATLAB functions were developed to enhance and analyse the temperature data [19]_CITE
"The Gaussian functions are used to describe the membership degree of these inputs, due to their advantages of being smooth and non-zero at each point [9]_CITE"
"Although, for common engineering problems, one hidden layer is sufficient for model training, two or more hidden layers may be needed for very complex phenomena [9]_CITE"
"An online community consists of members sharing common interests and purposes administered through guidelines and policies within a computer system ( Preece,_2000_CITE)"
"Online community life has increasingly become a significant part of our social lives ( Burkell,_Fortier,_Wong,_&_Simpson,_2014_CITE) and has become a new channel through which organisations can connect with stakeholders, including job candidates ( Madera,_2012_CITE)"
"As increasing numbers of employers utilise these platforms to screen job candidates ( Bohnert_&_Ross,_2010_CITE), job candidates are increasingly presenting themselves in online communities to impress employers ( Dekay,_2009_CITE)."
"Online communities have paved new paths for job seeking in the computer-mediated communication (CMC) environment ( Ikenberry,_Hibel,_&_Freedman,_2010_CITE), but few studies have examined how cues in the context of an online community affect job seekers behaviours, such as impression formation and self-presentation strategies ( van_der_Heide,_D Angelo,_&_Schumaker,_2012_CITE)"
"Although self-presentation in online communities has been previously examined (eg, Birnbaum,_2013;_DeAndrea_&_Walther,_2011;_Labrecque,_Markos,_&_Milne,_2011;_Schw mmlein_&_Wodzicki,_2012_CITE), job seeking within online communities is qualitatively different from many other online settings because of the anticipation of face-to-face job interviews ( Jansen,_K nig,_Stadelmann,_&_Kleinmann,_2012_CITE) and the social script ( Gioia_&_Poole,_1984_CITE) for the hiring process in this context."
"Membership in the LinkedIn ( www.linkedin.com) online community has grown exponentially ( Gerard,_2011_CITE)"
"500 companies use LinkedIn for talent acquisition ( Barnes_&_Lescault,_2012_CITE)"
"LinkedIn is perhaps the most successful and widely used social networking site (SNS) for recruiters and job seekers and is the world largest professional network on the Internet ( Adams,_2013_CITE)."
"Some articles suggest ways that job seekers can enhance their chances of employment by optimising their self-presentation on LinkedIn (eg, Damnianovi ,_Matovi ,_Kosti ,_&_Okanovi ,_2012_CITE)"
"However, little evidence exists to determine whether job seekers efforts to build their professional identity online are merely futile attempts to advance their careers or whether they might actually help job seekers secure opportunities for job interviews ( Guillory_&_Hancock,_2012_CITE)"
"As the realm of job seeking in online communities has not been studied extensively ( Bohnert_&_Ross,_2010;_Davison,_Maraist,_&_Bing,_2011_CITE), there is a gap in the current research on job seekers self-presentation in online communities"
"To answer our research question, we begin by reviewing a well-known approach in social psychology self-presentation ( Goffman,_1959_CITE) to understand how job seekers present themselves and manage their self-presentations in an online community"
"Second, we explain how job seekers self-presentations lead to recruiters hiring recommendations through recruiter multiple-fit perceptions of applicants based on the theory of person environment fit ( Kristof-Brown,_Zimmerman,_&_Johnson,_2005_CITE)"
"One explanation for the behaviour of people in various social situations is provided by the script concept ( Gioia_&_Poole,_1984_CITE), which considers context-specific norms that specify the impressions that people should convey of themselves ( Leary,_1995_CITE), such as self-presentation in seeking a job ( Marcus,_2009_CITE)"
"The goal of self-presentation is to make others accept the images that individuals claim for themselves ( Goffman,_1959_CITE)"
"In the workforce recruiting context, job seekers must present themselves in accordance with a script and ensure that recruiters positively evaluate their image ( Jansen_et_al.,_2012;_Lievens_&_Peeters,_2008_CITE)."
"Consistent with the script concept, personal profile and r sum content are generally considered to be evidence of a job seeker employability ( Breaugh,_2009;_Nemanick_&_Clark,_2002_CITE), and these features have become the most commonly used tools in personnel selection ( Cole,_Rubin,_Feild,_&_Giles,_2007_CITE)"
"Job seekers may acquire this script through self-help books or websites focusing on how to succeed in self-presentation with a strong profile and r sum ( Tyler_&_McCullough,_2009_CITE)."
"Online communities such as LinkedIn have initiated a new era of workforce recruitment ( Guillory_&_Hancock,_2012_CITE) in which recruiters are increasingly using these SNSs to source and screen job candidates ( Davison_et_al.,_2011_CITE), and job seekers are encouraged to create professional identities in combination with their personal profile and r sum content to enhance the likelihood that they will convey a positive impression in the new script ( Caers_&_Castelyns,_2011_CITE)"
"This new script may also influence whether job seekers meet recruiters expectations in online communities ( Bohnert_&_Ross,_2010;_Damnianovi _et_al.,_2012_CITE)."
"Online communities are actually online manifestations of physical communities, despite their strong reliance on technology and physical distance between participants ( Daneshgar_&_Ho,_2008_CITE)"
"When people become members of a community, they must select the relevant and appropriate pieces of information for their self-presentation to be consistent with the script for the group ( Hornsey,_Grice,_Jetten,_Paulsen,_&_Callan,_2007_CITE)."
"Managing self-presentation in online communities is an integral part of private and professional life ( Rui_&_Stefanone,_2013_CITE)"
"However, the willingness to provide personal information in member profiles on these SNSs is generally high because members gain acceptance through extensive self-presentation that facilitates the establishment of relationships with other network members ( Schw mmlein_&_Wodzicki,_2012_CITE)."
van_Dijck_(2013)_CITE found that a LinkedIn profile can be used to shape an idealised portrait of one professional identity by displaying skills to peers and anonymous evaluators
"A member professional identity might also receive a boost from contributing to the Question and Answer space provided by the SNS ( Raban,_2009_CITE), which is typically called a post and comment"
"Accordingly, withholding personal information appeared to be incompatible with the key motivations for joining these online communities ( Debatin,_Lovejoy,_Horn,_&_Hughes,_2009_CITE)"
"In other words, the large amount of information disclosed on these SNS might be a response to the CMC environment, which made the goal of building self-presentation salient, particularly for job seekers ( Dekay,_2009_CITE)."
"Consistent with Goffman_(1959)_CITE, members in online communities have various socio-discursive needs expressive, communicative, or promotional that reflect the need for different personas and that necessitate different addresses"
"Although gaining employment is often a goal of self-presentation, it is not the exclusive goal; people engage in self-presentation for many social reasons, including to conduct business, to establish friendships, or simply to express themselves ( Shepherd,_2005_CITE)"
"Consequently, difficulties may arise when a person wishes to create multiple impressions for different audiences online ( Labrecque_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Failures may also become clear if a job seeker online self-presentation does not match a recruiter expectations ( Bohnert_&_Ross,_2010_CITE)"
"Because personal goals affect self-presentation in online communities, it is important for job seekers to provide information related to specific topics and recruiter interests that may enhance the likelihood of obtaining hiring recommendations ( Schw mmlein_&_Wodzicki,_2012_CITE)."
"Because a job seeker self-presentation in an online community contains a wide range of information ( Rosenberg_&_Egbert,_2011_CITE), how recruiters perceive and make decisions based on that information is critical to the hiring process ( Caers_&_Castelyns,_2011_CITE)"
"The theory of person environment fit ( Kristof-Brown_et_al.,_2005_CITE) and the elaboration likelihood model (ELM; Petty_&_Cacioppo,_1986_CITE) may help determine whether job seekers online self-presentation can predict recruiters hiring recommendations ( Dineen,_Noe,_&_Ash,_2002_CITE)."
"Tsai,_Chi,_Huang,_and_Hsu_(2011)_CITE found that a job seeker can influence recruiter evaluations through impression management"
"Although the effect of applicant impression management has been studied primarily in the context of employment interviews (eg, Jansen_et_al.,_2012_CITE), researchers have noted that job seekers may employ online impression management tactics to create a desirable image ( Guillory_&_Hancock,_2012_CITE)"
"Job seekers can affect recruiters person environment fit perceptions by promoting themselves ( Sekiguchi,_2007_CITE), which can in turn increase their opportunities to be offered subsequent job interviews or the job itself ( Higgins_&_Judge,_2004_CITE)"
"Person environment fit generally refers to the compatibility between individual and work environment characteristics ( Kristof-Brown_et_al.,_2005_CITE)"
"Person environment fit encompasses a variety of manifestations, and fit between an employee and the work environment has been shown to increase the likelihood of maximum work efficiency ( Caplan_&_Harrison,_1993_CITE)"
The person environment fit literature highlights the attraction aspect of both Schneider s_(1987)_CITE attraction selection attrition model and Byrne s_(1971)_CITE similarity attraction paradigm and suggests that people are attracted to organisations that have characteristics congruent with their own.
"Two of the most commonly examined aspects of person environment fit are person job (P J) fit and person organisation (P O) fit ( Gregory,_Meade,_&_Thompson,_2013_CITE)"
"P J fit is concerned with the fit between applicants knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) and the job requirements for future performance ( Higgins_&_Judge,_2004_CITE)"
"Because P J fit has been shown to predict a job seeker future task performance ( Kristof-Brown_et_al.,_2005_CITE), recruiters are motivated to match job seekers KSAs with job requirements during the candidate screening processes through SNSs ( Roulin_&_Bangerter,_2013_CITE)"
"Therefore, recruiters evaluations of P J fit based on job seekers self-presentations tend to have positive effects on hiring recommendations ( Kristof-Brown,_2000_CITE)"
"P O fit is concerned with the compatibility between applicants and organisational characteristics for value congruence ( Piasentin_&_Chapman,_2007_CITE)"
"Research has consistently found that selecting applicants with high levels of P O fit can predict not only lower levels of turnover intention and absenteeism ( Arthur,_Bell,_Villado,_&_Doverspike,_2006_CITE) but also higher levels of job satisfaction, organisational commitment, and organisational citizenship behaviour ( Wei,_2012_CITE)"
"Because perceived P O fit is a measure of an individual perceived congruence with an organisation ( Kristof-Brown,_2000_CITE), job seekers self-presentation as provided on a SNS may allow recruiters to determine whether the job seekers personal characteristics fit well with an organisation characteristics ( Roulin_&_Bangerter,_2013_CITE)"
"Research has found that hiring decisions are made based on both objective qualifications (eg, P J fit and P O fit) and subjective impressions (eg, Wade_&_Kinicki,_1997_CITE)"
"Sometimes, subjective impressions affect hiring recommendations significantly more than objective qualifications because of an affective effect ( Roebken,_2010_CITE) or unavoidable prejudices ( Lodato,_Highhouse,_&_Brooks,_2011_CITE) that may be unrelated to job or organisational performance ( Highhouse,_2008_CITE)"
"Research evidence indicates that recruiters give subjectively desirable applicants more favourable evaluations than subjectively undesirable applicants and that subjective impressions increase recruiters perceived person person (P P) fit, thereby influencing hiring recommendations (eg, Davison_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"For example, job seekers opinions or background information may enhance recruiters similar-to-me or affective effects towards these applicants, which might increase recruiters intentions to hire the applicants ( Rynes,_Barber,_&_Varma,_2000_CITE)"
"As a result, job seekers presenting attributes that are more desirable to recruiters will likely be considered ideal employees by such recruiters ( Garcia,_Posthuma,_&_Colella,_2008_CITE)"
"Self-presentation is a key process of argument and persuasion aimed at making a desired impression on a particular audience in an online community ( Rosenberg_&_Egbert,_2011_CITE)"
"The ELM is a theory of the processes responsible for yielding to persuasive communication ( Petty_&_Cacioppo,_1986_CITE) and can be used to explain how job seekers self-presentations influence recruiters hiring recommendations ( Forret_&_Turban,_1996_CITE)"
"By contrast, less relevant information is more likely to be processed via a peripheral route in which more superficial cues play a larger role in attitude formation ( Gregory_et_al.,_2013_CITE)"
"The central and peripheral routes to persuasion are not exhaustive and are not mutually exclusive categories of persuasion ( O Keefe,_2002_CITE), and people may engage in both central and peripheral processing simultaneously ( Choi_&_Salmon,_2003_CITE)."
"Forret_and_Turban_(1996)_CITE argued that the use of central routes for information, such as P J fit and P O fit, enables recruiters to process job seekers qualifications more thoroughly, resulting in greater discrimination between more and less qualified applicants"
"ELM acknowledges that argument quality and source credibility are key determinants of persuasion outcomes ( Petty_&_Cacioppo,_1986_CITE)"
"Argument quality should be defined and assessed in terms of the presence of and relationships among rational assertions ( Boller,_Swasy,_&_Munch,_1990_CITE); source credibility refers to the extent to which the source of a persuasive message is perceived to be capable of making correct assertions ( Pornpitakpan,_2004_CITE)"
"Mak,_Schmitt,_and_Lyytinen_(1997)_CITE proposed that source credibility has been regarded as one of the major peripheral cues, whereas the strength of argument quality has been found to be a critical factor for central route messages"
"In other words, an individual with central route information processing is always influenced by argument quality, whereas an individual with peripheral route information processing is always persuaded by source credibility ( Li,_2013_CITE)."
"Because argument quality and source credibility have positive effects on perceived online information quality ( Yi,_Yoon,_&_Davis,_2013_CITE), we predicted that job seekers in an online community would be perceived as having P J and P O fit when their self-presentations have high argument quality and that their self-presentations would be perceived as having P P fit when they have high source credibility"
"The survey profiles of job seekers reflect the majority of LinkedIn members: currently employed individuals who are interested in obtaining information concerning new career possibilities and who are prepared to act upon these opportunities in this online community ( Dekay,_2009_CITE)"
"Each recruiter was asked to randomly and carefully review 20 LinkedIn profiles within both their and the researchers connections who meet the basic requirements in terms of relevant experience, educational background, and work location, which is the information that determines recruiters initial judgements regarding hiring recommendations ( Cole_et_al.,_2007_CITE)"
"The purpose of this step was to eliminate or minimise the possibility that the recruiters interview-based impressions of a job seeker would contaminate their evaluation of the job seeker self-presentation ( Tsai_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"To avoid the potential problem of social desirability ( Podsakoff,_MacKenzie,_Lee,_&_Podsakoff,_2003_CITE), the respondents were simply told that the purpose of this study was to identify factors that influenced recruiters perceptions when reviewing job seekers LinkedIn profiles"
"PLS is suited for explaining complex relationships, as it avoids two serious problems: inadmissible solutions and factor indeterminacy ( Fornell_&_Bookstein,_1982_CITE)"
"Moreover, PLS offers the benefit of lower sample size requirements ( Chin,_Marcolin,_&_Newsted,_2003_CITE)"
"Third, the average variance extracted (AVE) was greater than the 0.5 threshold ( Fornell_&_Larcker,_1981_CITE)"
"To assess discriminant validity, the root square of AVE and all reflective interconstruct correlations were compared ( S nchez-Franco_&_Roldan,_2005_CITE)"
s_(2003)_CITE approach to examine the CMV using Harman single factor test for the 14 models
"The results of this study revealed that recruiters positively perceive P J fit, P O fit, and P P fit when a job seeker offers argument quality and source credibility for specific self-presentation categories on LinkedIn, which indicates that there is indeed a commonly shared script ( Jansen_et_al.,_2012_CITE) that places clear demands on job seekers self-presentation in online communities"
"For example, given that involvement with non-work activities is an indicator of job seekers vocational interests ( Ehrhart,_2007_CITE), recruiters may rely more on job seekers publications as a basis of their judgements of P J fit when the job vacancies require occupants to have more artistic (eg, journalist) than conventional (eg, human resources) traits."
"In applying the ELM to recruitment in an online community context, because recruiters do not always have the ability or the motivation to process job seekers qualifications central route information ( Forret_&_Turban,_1996_CITE) they may be persuaded by identification with the source presented by the job seeker through peripheral route information processing ( Bhattacherjee_&_Sanford,_2006_CITE)"
"If the persuasive messages come from a credible source, affective response (eg, perceived P P fit) can be evoked ( Li,_2013_CITE)."
"First, recruiters under high levels of accountability and training load will engage in greater elaboration than recruiters under low levels of accountability and training load, and when recruiters engage in greater elaboration, they will be influenced more by central route information ( Forret_&_Turban,_1996_CITE)"
"CMV is a complex topic, and one can never be certain of the extent to which correlations are inflated or attenuated as a result of the measurement method ( Gregory_et_al.,_2013_CITE)"
"The present study proposed a model that links job seeker self-presentations to recruiter hiring recommendations in an online community and is rooted in the ELM ( Petty_&_Cacioppo,_1986_CITE) and person environment fit theory ( Kristof-Brown_et_al.,_2005_CITE)"
"When the recruiter does not carefully process the job seeker qualifications but is instead influenced by messages (eg, P P fit) that are unrelated to job-relevant information, the recruiter is engaging in low elaboration through a peripheral route ( Forret_&_Turban,_1996_CITE)"
"Moreover, many job seekers build their profiles in this online community for professional use and expect employers to view their profiles ( Roulin_&_Bangerter,_2013_CITE)"
"Job seekers may have various needs for different personas, necessitating different addresses in the online community ( Bohnert_&_Ross,_2010_CITE)"
"However, managing multiple online personas is increasingly difficult, and separating one social and professional worlds appears to be nearly impossible without the proper mechanisms for exercising such control ( Labrecque_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"The q prior responses and other covariates are treated on an equal footing as explanatory variables in a convenient parametric model, for example, a generalized linear model ( Diggle_et al.,_2013_CITE, Chapter 10)"
"Variable length Markov chains ( B hlmann_and_Wyner,_1999_CITE) relax the assumption that the conditional distribution involves q prior responses, instead allowing the number of previous variables that enter the conditioning to vary according to the values of these variables"
"Other ways to construct parsimonious higher-order Markov chain models have been proposed ( Raftery_and_Tavare,_1994_CITE)."
"An example concerning side-effect profiles in a clinical trial of neuroleptica is given in Edwards_(2000,_Section 7.1.3)_CITE"
"Some recent work has extended Bayesian network methodology to support context-specific modelling ( Boutilier_et al.,_1996;_Myers_and_Troyanskaya,_2007_CITE)."
In this paper we study a class of models due to Ron_et al._(1998)_CITE called acyclic probabilistic finite automata
"Note that here, except for a brief mention in Section 6, we do not include explanatory variables in the models; for a way to do this see Edwards_and_Ankinakatte_(in press,_Section 8)_CITE."
"Sample trees are also known as prefix tree acceptors in machine learning ( Carrasco_and_Oncina,_1994_CITE), and event trees in Bayesian decision theory ( Smith_and_Anderson,_2008_CITE)."
The algorithm proposed by Ron_et al._(1998)_CITE to select an APFA given a data sample proceeds as follows
"To assess this ( Ron_et al.,_1998_CITE) proposed a dissimilarity score between nodes v and w, written (v,w), and a fixed threshold,"
"More precisely, v and w are called similar if (v,w) The dissimilarity score proposed by Ron_et al._(1998)_CITE was R(v,w)=maxk=i+1 pmaxxi+1, ,k|Pr (Xi+1, ,k=xi+1, ,k|X i C(v)) Pr (Xi+1, ,k=xi+1, ,k|X i C(w))|"
In Browning_(2006)_CITE the same dissimilarity score is used but the algorithm is modified in two ways
In Ron_et al._(1998)_CITE the order in which nodes within a stage are compared and possibly merged was unspecified
"Instead, Browning_(2006)_CITE describes a greedy approach in which dissimilarities between all pairs of nodes at the stage are computed, and the most similar pair (v,w) is merged"
"In Browning_and_Browning_(2007a)_CITE the threshold was further modified to take the form (v,w)=mn(v) 1+n(w) 1+b, where m and b are scale and shift tuning parameters, respectively"
"The values m=4 and b=0.2 were recommended in Browning_and_Browning_(2007a)_CITE, based on unpublished simulation studies"
"For the Akaike information criterion ( Akaike,_1973_CITE), =2 and for the Bayesian information criterion ( Schwarz_et al.,_1978_CITE), =log(N)"
"Under suitable regularity conditions, minimizing the BIC is consistent in the sense that for large N it selects the simplest model consistent with the data ( Ripley,_1996_CITE, Section 2.6)"
"The mildew data stem from a cross between two isolates of the barley powdery mildew fungus ( Christiansen_and_Giese,_1990_CITE)"
The data and its preprocessing are further described in Edwards_(2013)_CITE
"This reflects the relatively low haplotype diversity in this region ( Edwards,_2013_CITE)"
"However, as we discuss below, the tests for merging at the initial stages may suffer from low power: it would be interesting to examine this with other methods ( Edwards_and_Ankinakatte,_in press_CITE, Section 8), but we do not attempt this here"
"We observe that for all three data sets the goodness-of-fit of the proposed method is comparable to that of Beagle, when the settings implicit in Browning_(2006)_CITE ( m=1 and b=0) are used, and superior to Beagle, when the settings suggested in Browning_and_Browning_(2007a)_CITE ( m=4 and b=0.2) are used"
"The BIC-based procedure is slightly slower, and Beagle with the settings suggested in Browning_and_Browning_(2007a)_CITE ( m=4 and b=0.2) performs substantially worse than the alternatives, particularly at smaller sample sizes"
"As described in Edwards_and_Ankinakatte_(in press,_Section 10)_CITE, first order Markov models correspond to APFA in which, for each stage, all incoming edges with the same symbol are merged"
"As an alternative to KLD, Thollard_et al._(2000)_CITE proposed to compare two PFA using a quantity they called the KL-increment, defined as KLI(A,B)=KLD(Amax,B) KLD(Amax,A), where Amax is the unrestricted model"
"The dissimilarity score proposed by Ron_et al._(1998)_CITE was R(v,w)=maxk=i+1 pmaxxi+1, ,k|Pr (Xi+1, ,k=xi+1, ,k|X i C(v)) Pr (Xi+1, ,k=xi+1, ,k|X i C(w))|"
"Two types of unique generalized inverses, namely A -=A -AA and A -=A AA - for a square matrix A of index 1 were defined by Rao and Mitra Page 97, [11]_CITE"
The same have been rediscovered by Baksalary and Trenkler in [3]_CITE and the g-inverse A -=A -AA has been named the core inverse of A
"The other g-inverse A -=A AA -, (which also exists when the matrix is of index 1), has properties and theory similar to that of core inverse as noted in [3]_CITE."
"For the sake of convenience, we record the following canonical form [4]_CITE of A and its core inverse G given in [3]_CITE"
The core inverse of A(whenever it exits) is denoted by A and is given as (2)A =U( K)-1000U .The Moore Penrose inverse and the group inverse (whenever it exists) of a matrix A having representation (1) are respectively equal to (3)A =UK -10L -10U and (4)A#=UK-1 -1K-1 -1K-1L00U as shown in [3]_CITE.
"Whenever core inverse of A exists, it is unique [3]_CITE."
"As shown in Theorem 1(viii) of [3]_CITE, we have A A=A#A"
A complex square matrix is range Hermitian if and only if C(A)=C(A ) if and only if A =A =A# [3]_CITE
"If A has representation (1), then A is range Hermitian if and only if L=0 as shown in [3]_CITE."
"We note that some of these matrix orders have been defined over arbitrary field, for instance in [10]_CITE"
"Then A is below B under the star order [9]_CITE(written as A B) if AA =BA andA A=A B.Also, A is below B under the right star order [2]_CITE ( A B) if AA =BA andC(A ) C(B ).Similarly, A is below B under the left star order [2]_CITE ( A B) if A A=A BandC(A) C(B).Let A and B be complex rectangular matrices of the same order over"
"Then A is below B under the space pre-order [7]_CITE( A Similarly, A is below B under the left sharp order ( A# B), if A#A=A#B and C(A) C(B) [10]_CITE"
We denote a c-inverse of A by Ac- [10]_CITE

"The core partial order was defined in [3]_CITE as follows: Definition 2.1Let A,B be square matrices of index 1 and of the same order"
"It was shown in [3]_CITE that if A has representation (1), then B must be of the form (5)B=U K L0ZU ,where K is non-singular, U is unitary and Z is some matrix of index 1"
"If A is as in (1), then B is as in (5) and as shown in proof of Theorem 6 of [3]_CITE that B =U( K)-1-( K)-1 LZ 0Z U .Thus, it can be checked easily that BA =AB =UI000U"
The equivalence of (i) and (ii) is already established in [3]_CITE
As shown in [3]_CITE A A=A B A A=A B and AA =BA BA=A2
"Now A A=B Q QA(Qis an orthogonal projector andQA=A)=B QA,=B A,=A B.So, A A=A B or equivalently A A=A B [3]_CITE"
"Thus, B=U K L0B4U .Moreover, B is of index 1, so, B4 is of index 1 [3]_CITE"
"It was also shown in [3]_CITE that for A=1100 and B=1101,A B and A B A B and A B A #B"
"Then, B as in (5) is given by B=U K L0ZU , where K is non-singular, U is unitary and Z is some matrix of index 1 [3]_CITE"
"When A B, it has been shown in [3]_CITE that B =U( K)-1-( K)-1 LZ 0Z U .Once again, by direct calculation L=0"
"If A is as in (1), then A=U K000U and B=U K00ZU , where Z is some matrix of index 1 [3]_CITE"
"(i), (ii) and (iii) are equivalent as A =A =A# [3]_CITE"
"(ii) (v) By Theorem 2.1 [1]_CITE (v) (iii) Taking AB=A2, and pre-multiplying by (A#)2, we have (A#)2AB=(A#)2A"
"(ii) (v) By Theorem 2.1 [1]_CITE The following result follows from Theorem 2.5 in view of Theorem 6.4.6 [10]_CITE, A #B if and only if A -cB [10]_CITE: Corollary 3.4Let A,B be square matrices of index 1 and of the same order"
"Therefore, by Theorem 5.4.3 of [10]_CITE and Theorem 3.3 we have (iv)B A (AB)=B (A A)B=B (A A)B=B (AA )B=(B A)(A B)=(B A)(BA )=(AB B)A =AA Since AA is Hermitian, B A (AB) is Hermitian"
"Also, by Theorem 3.2 [6]_CITE, (AB) =B A"
"So, (AB) =B A =B A .Now, ABB A =ABB A =AB(AB) =PABFurther by Theorem 4.2.14 [10]_CITE, C(B A )=C((AB) )=C(B A )=C(B#A#)=C((AB)#)=C(AB)showing that B A is the core inverse of AB"
"Therefore, by Lemma 1(ii) of [3]_CITE, A is a projector"
(2) The following are equivalent for the class of Hermitian matrices in view of Theorem 8.3.10 of [10]_CITE and Theorem 3.3: (i) A B(ii) A B(iii) A #B(iv) A -B and A2 LB2
"(3) In view of Theorem 2.5, Theorems 6.3.13, Remark 6.5.13 and 6.5.25 [10]_CITE, the following are equivalent: (i) A B(ii) A -B,C(BA)=C(A) and B A is Hermitian"
"Recently, eigen projections at 0 have been studied for the star and sharp orders [5]_CITE"
"If A has representation (1), then as in [3]_CITE B must be of the form (6)B=U K L0ZU ,where K is non-singular, U is unitary and Z is some matrix of index 1"
"Also, A# is as in (4) and by Lemma 4 [3]_CITE, B#=UK-1 -1X00Z#U , where X0=( K)-2 L(I-ZZ#)-( K)-1 LZ#"
"Hence (A )2=B A Z=0.In this case, it can be easily verified that (A ) A =(A ) B , which is equivalent to (A ) A =(A ) B [10]_CITE"
"As pointed out in [3]_CITE, one can define another partial order using A -=A AA#"
"Similarly, A is below B under the left sharp order ( A# B), if A#A=A#B and C(A) C(B) [10]_CITE."
We denote a c-inverse of A by Ac- [10]_CITE.
"The following result follows from Theorem 2.5 in view of Theorem 6.4.6 [10]_CITE, A #B if and only if A -cB [10]_CITE: Corollary 3.4Let A,B be square matrices of index 1 and of the same order"
"Managers spend up to one fifth of their working time with conflict resolution and negotiation [15,63]_CITE"
"They increasingly negotiate via electronic media such as e-mail, e-meeting and e-negotiation systems [73]_CITE"
"Electronic negotiations are not mere translations of traditional negotiations onto electronic media, but rather they provide additional value by supporting the decision making and/or communication process [62,74]_CITE"
"A negotiation support system (NSS) comprises one or more of the following functionalities: facilitation of communication, decision/negotiation analysis support, process organization and structuring, and access to information, negotiation knowledge, experts, mediators or facilitators [26]_CITE"
"We know from empirical evidence that the way information is presented strongly influences human perceptions, preferences and decision making (eg [5,76]_CITE)"
"Thus, the presentation of information is of essential importance for decision makers [70,77]_CITE."
"Current technological advances allow decision makers to access information more easily by using wireless networks, data warehouses and similar tools [42,52]_CITE"
"The vast amount of information is not necessarily linked to more accurate and efficient decisions, but rather sometimes to information overload for a decision maker (eg [41,72]_CITE)"
"Scientific interest also focuses on handling large amounts of information and on overcoming mental resource limitations and cognitive biases (eg [23,46]_CITE)"
"These developments have led to the advancement of stylized decision aids that represent the problem in a stylized way that capitalizes on some special human cognitive processing ability [ 86_CITE, p_46]"
"Traditional stylized decision aids are tables and graphs in the form of lines, scatter plots, bar charts, and animations [45]_CITE"
"These display formats have been used successfully to extend human processing abilities in decision making [34,78,79]_CITE"
"Thus far, scholars have focused on the improvement of tool-functionalities which aid bargainers in the negotiation process (eg [11,37,53]_CITE)"
"In that sense, graphical support implemented in a system would be used to improve process and outcome (eg [7,12,82]_CITE)"
"In electronic negotiation systems, information to be represented in a graphical manner would include message threads, preferences and utility values [62]_CITE."
"Except for the suggested utilization of the negotiation dance graph [56]_CITE, to date only a history graph has been proposed and implemented [27,63]_CITE"
Speier and Morris [71]_CITE provide a study associating literature on graphical support and cognitive fit theory
"Along with Smelcer and Carmel [68]_CITE, they extend the view of comparative advantages of graphical display formats by showing that the performance difference in terms of time and accuracy increases even with task complexity"
"The relationship between the level of information processing and environmental complexity has the shape of an inverted U [65]_CITE, demonstrating that graphical aids allow users to gather more information prior to reaching the critical point of information overload"
"A more recent Speier study [70]_CITE illustrates that subjects supported with graphs perform as well as subjects supported with tables, when facing complex symbolic tasks involving decision accuracy"
"Recently, Khatri et al [28]_CITE extended the perspective of cognitive fit for external problem presentations and internal task representations"
Other studies suggest a trade-off between the benefits of minimizing errors and the cognitive effort or time needed in a particular task environment [14]_CITE
"When facing complex situations, decision makers use cognitive simplification strategies [15,61]_CITE and pursue a strategy of swapping effort in terms of time invested in the problem solution for accuracy [24]_CITE"
Jarvenpaa [22]_CITE introduces the term incongruence to describe a situation in which the processing required for a decision strategy and the process encouraged by the graphical tool are in conflict
Dilla and Steibart [13]_CITE confirm that additional mental calculations increase the potential of making mistakes.
"Numerical systems require well-structured inputs in a predefined format [19]_CITE, show impacts of variables on results [7]_CITE and provide assessment scores [36]_CITE"
"However, numerical systems do not support decision makers in handling dynamic processes [7]_CITE"
"In negotiations, the history of exchanged offers, the concessions of the negotiation parties over time, their possible change of preferences and similar dynamic processes contain essential information for negotiators [62,81]_CITE"
"They present data in separable formats, which introduce single point values more accurately than other representation aids [12,31,67]_CITE"
"Results from various studies indicate that tables should be used to present information when decision makers are required to recall specific amounts, handle values accurately (eg [5,12,45]_CITE) or compare data [44]_CITE"
"Therefore, in conflict situations with high sensitivity to small deviations from the optimum, tabular reports can provide exact values that are more resistant to distortion in comparison with other forms of information representation [4,5]_CITE"
"Any links between the single values displayed must be made by the decision makers since tables neither provide support for integrating the effects of a number of variables in one period of time, as schematic faces do, nor for showing the effects of one variable over more periods of time, as graphs do [67,79]_CITE"
"The general assumption is that symbolic representation facilitates extracting and acting on discrete data values, and analytical processes provide the most appropriate access for decision makers to data presented in tables [78 80]_CITE."
"They are described as being imaginastic, which means that they convey continuous information, while tables are seen as verbal in nature, ie they convey discrete information [78,79]_CITE"
"Graphs have visuospatial properties meaning they stress information on data relationship rather than on linguistic intelligence [4,5]_CITE"
"They also allow for the grouping of information [35]_CITE and the establishment of associations among the values of each information package (or variable) across time periods without addressing the elements separately or analytically (eg [4,78,79]_CITE)"
"Many perceptual inferences, including perceiving and drawing inferences, are automatically supported at low cognitive costs [8,34]_CITE"
"Graphs facilitate the comprehension of large amounts of quantitative information [44,67]_CITE"
"Empirical research has reported that subjects provided with graphical formats are more effective in trend, pattern and time sequence data detection, (eg [12,68,77]_CITE) and in task execution in terms of processing time (eg [31,32,44]_CITE)."
"Concerning the level of complexity, tables outperform graphs regarding time and decision accuracy in simple decision making settings [45,58]_CITE"
"At a low level of complexity, graphs are perceived to be more difficult to read than tabular displays [12]_CITE"
An increase in task complexity is better mediated by spatial rather than linear information displays [68]_CITE
"Studies suggest that graphical decision aids are more efficient and lead to better performance when subjects face a higher cognitive load [45,58,70]_CITE"
"Graphs have been found to be more appropriate for the presentation of large amounts of information [12]_CITE, because users have to invest less effort in order to get the message shown in graphical displays [5,6,40]_CITE"
"Users sometimes prefer graphs to tables due to their appealing format; they enjoy exercises and experience a higher level of satisfaction [40,43,77]_CITE"
"Still, subjects do not always prefer the most appropriate presentation format for the relevant task [20,32]_CITE."
The most common and straightforward way to provide users of NSS with information about multi-issue offers is to present the utility values [27]_CITE
"Offers are evaluated and compared to the negotiator's aspirations, reservation level or to the BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement) over several periods of time, while all social interactions are processed simultaneously [1,66]_CITE."
"One way to visualize the negotiation process graphically is the history graph (see Fig_2 ), which has already been implemented in NSS [63,64,82]_CITE"
"Alternatively, literature proposes the use of the negotiation dance graph [56]_CITE"
"Within an integrative negotiation approach, the knowledge of the counterpart's true preferences facilitates Pareto-improving negotiation moves and consequently efficient agreements [56]_CITE"
"Negoisst is a web-based NSS offering sophisticated support and formal document management [62,63]_CITE"
Swaab et al [75]_CITE propose that negotiators provided with graphical decision aids develop a better understanding of the negotiation problem
"Since negotiators refer to salient information [61]_CITE, we assume that negotiators with graph support will be more focused on the task at hand, with knowledge of the entire process and the ability to discuss issues in terms of utility values"
"Furthermore, negotiators supported with graphs should be better able to create a shared cognition of the conflict situation and consequently facilitate communication about needs and interests rather than positions (eg [43,61,75]_CITE)"
"Additionally, graphs could also enhance the process of idea generation [7]_CITE"
It is assumed that there are several reasons why people act in a fair manner [9]_CITE
"Apart from altruistic motives, people behave justly hoping for reciprocity from the other party or to avoid being punished for unfair behavior (eg [54,87]_CITE)"
"Negotiators often base their decisions on heuristic strategies or on oversimplifying rules, which allow them to generate leverage effects within the decision accuracy-benefit trade-offs [24]_CITE"
This behavior reduces cognitive effort and negative effect [18]_CITE
"However, if conflicts become more difficult, the result is often overconfidence (eg [23,46]_CITE) and less concessionary behavior from the involved parties [2]_CITE"
"To convince or persuade the counterpart of a biased opinion, they use hard tactics (threats, intimidation and demanding commitments) [69]_CITE"
"When negotiations have closed and parties leave the virtual bargaining table, they feel like either winners or losers [38]_CITE"
The provision of the history graph will lead to integrative negotiation behavior resulting in a better bargaining climate [25]_CITE
"According to the hypotheses stated above, we expect higher joint and more balanced outcomes to have a positive impact on the level of satisfaction (eg [17,37,77]_CITE)"
Decision makers aware of this fact should consequently ask their opponent for fair treatment and stress the importance of fairness more often [47]_CITE
The visualization of changes in utilities due to modifications in single issues in the negotiation dance graph helps negotiators to identify Pareto movements and efficient alternatives [56]_CITE
We assume that the visibility of differences in utilities during the negotiation process makes it more difficult to demand the bigger share of the cake [60]_CITE
"The inter-coder reliability, Cohen's , reached 0.94 which can be considered an excellent result [39]_CITE"
"First, several studies show that the level of conflict in simulation cases influences results significantly [11,53]_CITE"
The issue of time duration of the experiment must be taken into account [51]_CITE
The effects of additional support provided by graphical aids are often seen as a trade-off between the benefits of minimizing errors and the cognitive effort or time needed in a particular task environment [22]_CITE
Raiffa [56]_CITE argues that a negotiation resembles a dance of negotiation partners
"MSI is such an important part of sensory processing that it is present in virtually all organisms possessing multiple means of perception ( Stein_&_Alex_Meredith,_1993_CITE)"
"Just how constitutive it is for our perception of the world is apparent from the curious effects which arise in the (rare) cases when it goes wrong, like the ventriloquism or the McGurk effects ( Chen_&_Vroomen,_2013;_McGurk_&_MacDonald,_1976_CITE)"
"Like other models of the SC (or comparable MSI) ( Beck_et al.,_2008;_Deneve,_Latham,_&_Pouget,_2001;_Fetsch,_DeAngelis,_&_Angelaki,_2013;_Ohshiro,_Angelaki,_&_DeAngelis,_2011;_Ursino,_Cuppini,_Magosso,_Serino,_&_Pellegrino,_2009_CITE), ours has so far been purely stimulus-driven"
"The models due to Anastasio_and_Patton_(2003)_CITE, Cuppini,_Magosso,_Rowland,_Stein,_and_Ursino_(2012)_CITE, Martin,_Meredith_Alex,_and_Ahmad_(2009)_CITE, Pavlou_and_Casey_(2010)_CITE and Rowland,_Stanford,_and_Stein_(2007)_CITE do include projections from cortical areas to the SC"
"However, both Anastasio_and_Patton_(2003)_CITE and Martin_et al._(2009)_CITE have modeled only the effect of cortical input on multisensory enhancement in the SC, leaving aside the topographic organization which is characteristic of SC neurons receptive fields (RFs) ( King,_2013;_Sparks,_1988;_Wallace_&_Stein,_1996_CITE)"
"The models put forward by Cuppini_et al._(2012)_CITE and Rowland_et al._(2007)_CITE, while modeling the effect of cortical input on multisensory integration in the SC, focus on replicating biology and refrain from interpreting the meaning of cortical input, network connectivity, and neural computations, functionally."
"It also naturally produces specialization to different stimulus combinations in SC neurons ( Stein,_2012,_chap.33;_Wallace_&_Stein,_1996_CITE), a feature which has been interpreted in mathematical terms by Colonius_and_Diederich_(2004)_CITE but whose development has not been modeled, to our knowledge."
"This mechanism is to model the assumed capability of neurons to learn the statistical relationship between input activity and decision variables ( Soltani_&_Wang,_2010;_Yang_&_Shadlen,_2007_CITE)"
"The procedure is similar to that in the original SOM learning algorithm ( Kohonen,_1995_CITE, p_78 83): in every learning step, the network is presented with a newly generated input activity A=ai1,ai2, ,aim"
"This is to model the fact that auditory localization is generally less reliable than visual information for localization ( Alais_&_Burr,_2004_CITE)"
"The SC receives descending projections from various areas in the cortex ( Berson,_1988,_chap._2;_Chabot,_Mellott,_Hall,_Tichenoff,_&_Lomber,_2013;_Ferraina,_Par ,_&_Wurtz,_2002;_May,_2006;_Stein_et al.,_2014;_Wallace_&_Stein,_1994_CITE)"
"Some of those play a role in attention, like the frontal eye field (FEF), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) ( Buschman_&_Miller,_2007;_Kastner_&_Ungerleider,_2000_CITE)"
"In cats, the anterior ectosylvian cortex (AES) plays an especially important role: its deactivation eliminates neurophysiological multisensory integration ( Wallace_&_Stein,_1994_CITE) and drastically alters audio-visual orientation behavior ( Wilkinson,_Alex_Meredith,_&_Stein,_1996_CITE)"
"It has been implicated with selective attention ( Dehner,_Keniston,_Clemo,_&_Meredith,_2004;_Foxe,_2012,_chap._33_CITE), due to its effect on neural responses in the SC"
"Since orienting behavior is linked to attention ( Ignashchenkova,_Dicke,_Haarmeier,_&_Thier,_2004;_Kustov_&_Robinson,_1996_CITE, more recently), this implication is potentiated by the behavioral findings of Wallace_and_Stein_(1994)_CITE"
"In our model, attentional input may relate, for example, to FEF, for more spatial input ( Bruce,_Goldberg,_Bushnell,_&_Stanton,_1985_CITE), or AES, in cats, for more feature-related input ( Dehner_et al.,_2004_CITE)."
"Spatial attention can enhance the activity of SC neurons whose receptive fields overlap the attended region ( Goldberg_&_Wurtz,_1972;_Ignashchenkova_et al.,_2004_CITE)"
"In contrast to spatial attention, feature-based attention enhances activity of neurons selective to the features attended to across the visual field ( Born,_Ansorge,_&_Kerzel,_2012;_Maunsell_&_Treue,_2006_CITE)"
"Moreover, like in the experiments by Jack_and_Thurlow_(1973)_CITE and Warren,_Welch,_and_McCarthy_(1981)_CITE, semantic content changed the extent to which stimuli in different modalities were integrated: depending on the type of stimulus cognitive content coded for, the localization of cross-sensory stimuli was shifted towards the visual component, towards the auditory component, or in between"
"Ocular dominance stripes are also present naturally in the SCs of monkeys ( Pollack_&_Hickey,_1979_CITE) and they have been shown to arise in the tecta of tadpoles when they are implanted with a third eye ( Law_&_Constantine-Paton,_1981_CITE)"
Wallace_and_Stein_(1996)_CITE have found that not all SC neurons react to stimuli in all or even more than one sensory modality
This has been modeled computationally by Colonius_and_Diederich_(2004)_CITE who make a normative argument for why there are uni-sensory neurons in the SC
Weber_and_Triesch_(2009)_CITE have shown how essentially unsupervised learning can be extended and combined with mechanisms from reinforcement learning to emphasize learning of goal-relevant over goal-irrelevant features
"Krauzlis_et al._(2014)_CITE argue that for example the SC is involved in regulating spatial attention behaviorally, but neural activity related to selective attention in visual cortex remains after collicular deactivation"
"Since no single brain region or circuit seems necessary for an organism to exhibit behavioral effects of attention, Krauzlis_et al._(2014)_CITE argue that attention and its known neural correlates emerge simply because effective biological (and artificial) information processing requires state estimation"
"Also, we have previously ( Bauer_et al.,_2014_CITE) shown that it can reproduce the spatial principle and the principle of inverse effectiveness, as well as maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)-like behavioral multisensory integration which is presumably caused by the neural processes in the SC"
"The SC is one multisensory region in the brain, whose input output behavior is particularly well understood, and knowledge we glean about it can inform research on others ( Stein,_2012,_chap.33_CITE)"
"On the one hand, there are other brain regions which perform MSI more or less similar to the SC, like parts of AES ( Stein_&_Stanford,_2008_CITE), which are visual, auditory, and somatosensory; medial superior temporal area (MSTd), in which vestibular and visual cues converge ( Duffy,_1998_CITE); and, sub-cortically, regions in putamen, in which there is somatosensory and visual convergence ( Graziano_&_Gross,_1993_CITE)"
"For example, the organizing principle of AES is much more specificity to modalities and much less retinotopy than in SC ( Clarey_&_Irvine,_1990;_Dehner_et al.,_2004;_Alex_Meredith,_2004,_chap._21;_Olson_&_Graybiel,_1987_CITE)"
"Also, superadditivity does at least not seem to be as common in MSTd as in SC (although that might be due to the stimuli used in related studies of the two regions) ( Morgan,_DeAngelis,_&_Angelaki,_2008_CITE)"
"In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a serious debate about whether such a thing as software engineering even existed ( Hoare,_1978_CITE)"
"Many argued that software was not an engineering artefact and that to treat it as such was not only wrong but dangerous, with special opprobrium ( Dijkstra,_1978_CITE) being reserved for any dissenters who dared to advocate software testing ( De_Millo_et_al.,_1979_CITE)."
"This optimisation-centric view of software engineering is typified by the development of the area of research and practice known as Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) ( Harman_and_Jones,_2001;_Harman,_2007_CITE), a topic of growing interest for more than ten years ( Freitas_and_Souza,_2011_CITE)"
"SBSE has now permeated almost every area of software engineering activity ( Zhang_et_al.,_2008;_Afzal_et_al.,_2009;_Ali_et_al.,_2010;_R ih ,_2010;_Afzal_and_Torkar,_2011;_Harman_et_al.,_2012a_CITE)."
"Many papers have been written on the advantages of migrating software engineering activities to the cloud ( Abadi,_2009;_Sotomayor_et_al.,_2009;_Armbrust_et_al.,_2010_CITE)"
"No doubt there are many advantages of such a migration to SBSE computation in the cloud, some of which have already been realised ( Le_Goues_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"We re-formulate these problems as search problems in the standard manner for SBSE research ( Harman_and_Jones,_2001;_Harman,_2007_CITE), by proposing specific solution representations and evaluation functions to guide the search."
"Cloud computing ( Mell_and_Grance,_2009_CITE) is a relatively recent and currently high-profile method of IT deployment"
"These datacentres are described by Barroso_and_H lzle_(2009)_CITE as Warehouse-Sized Computers (WSCs), reflecting their view that the machines can collectively be regarded as a single entity"
"The coordination of these machines is supported by specialist software layers, including virtualisation technologies such as Xen ( Barham_et_al.,_2003_CITE) and distributed services such as BigTable ( Chang_et_al.,_2008_CITE)."
"Cloud computing promises to commoditise data storage, processing and serving in the way envisioned by utility computing ( Rappa,_2004_CITE) and service oriented architecture ( Papazoglou_and_van_den_Heuvel,_2007_CITE)."
"To drill down to the research themes of cloud computing, we remove from the underlying corpus all terms that occur in the concise NIST definition of cloud computing, which is the first sentence of Section 2 in Mell_and_Grance_(2009)_CITE"
"The graphical representations of the cloud word clouds are produced by Wordle, an online word cloud generation service ( Viegas_et_al.,_2009_CITE)."
"We fully expect the rapid, widespread adoption of cloud computing, as predicted by industry analysts IDC_(2011)_CITE."
"Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is the name given to a field of research and practice in which computational search and optimisation techniques are used to address problems in software engineering ( Harman_and_Jones,_2001_CITE)"
"There is also a tutorial paper aimed primarily at the reader with no prior knowledge of computational search or SBSE applications ( Harman_et_al.,_2012b_CITE) and a recent bibliometric analysis of ten years of SBSE literature (2001 2010) ( Freitas_and_Souza,_2011_CITE)"
"The distributed nature of systems in the cloud and the lower reliability ( Vishwanath_and_Nagappan,_2010_CITE) of cloud platforms require a new approach to fault tolerance"
"Testing procedures must be suitably adapted; the canonical example is Netflix's Chaos Monkey ( Netflix_Tech_Blog,_2008_CITE)."
"This is prevalent in the analysis of Big Data ( Jacobs,_2009_CITE)"
"Reese_(2009)_CITE notes that it is sometimes lost in discussions of cloud computing that scalability in itself is not an end, rather that scalability must coincide with the goals of the business"
"There are two major risks facing an organisation hoping to migrate or deploy to the cloud ( Armbrust_et_al.,_2009,_2010;_Cliff,_2010_CITE)"
"Projects such as Eucalyptus ( Nurmi_et_al.,_2009_CITE) have suggested a more pragmatic approach, by creating open-source implementations of proprietary APIs"
"From this point of view, the problems of resource management are clear: scheduling must take place across tens of thousands of machines; individual virtual machine instances must be assigned to physical servers; loads must be monitored and balanced; VMs can be migrated between servers, and memory can be paged across the network ( Williams_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"The main challenge is to ensure scalability and resilience ( DeCandia_et_al.,_2007_CITE)."
"For example, modern datacentres are for the most part power-inefficient ( Barroso_and_H lzle,_2009_CITE)"
"Detailed descriptions of SBSE algorithms and the software engineering applications to which they have hitherto been applied can be found elsewhere in surveys on SBSE ( Harman_et_al.,_2012a_CITE)."
"The guest operating system settings are generally configured at boot-time, for example through the boot parameters to the Linux kernel ( Red_Hat_Enterprise,_2007_CITE)"
"This approach would be similar to the work on SBSE for compiler optimisation, which searches the space of parameter settings: SBSE has been advocated as a tuning mechanism for compilers ( Cooper_et_al.,_1999_CITE)"
Hoste_and_Eeckhout_(2008)_CITE demonstrated how a compiler can be tuned by targeting different performance objectives for the code it produces
"Specialisation could help in reducing image size, reducing execution time, and lowering the time required to migrate an image across the network ( Voorsluys_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Program slicing might help to reduce the library to the bare essentials for the use cases required ( Guo_and_Engler,_2011_CITE)"
"Manual specialization effort ( Madhavapeddy_et_al.,_2010_CITE) demonstrates clear potential; the application of SBSE should automate this process."
"Another approach would be to use program slicing ( Harman_and_Hierons,_2001;_Silva,_2012_CITE) to slice away unused parts of an image that can be statically identified"
"Like partial evaluation, slicing has been studied for many years ( Weiser,_1979_CITE)"
"Related SBSE work using Genetic Programming (GP) ( Koza,_1992_CITE) includes recent advances in automated solutions to bug fixing ( Arcuri_and_Yao,_2008;_Weimer_et_al.,_2009_CITE), platform and language migration ( Langdon_and_Harman,_2010_CITE) and non-functional property optimisation ( White_et_al.,_2008,_2011;_Sitthi-Amorn_et_al.,_2011_CITE)."
"For example, Langdon_and_Harman_(2010)_CITE use a grammar based GP approach, in which changes are constrained by a grammar specialised to the program, while Le_Goues_et_al._(2012)_CITE represent a solution as a sequence of edits to the original in a manner reminiscent of earlier work on search based transformation ( Ryan,_2000;_Fatiregun_et_al.,_2005_CITE)"
"If an online approach is adopted, then an engineer might also be presented with occasional reports of Pareto-optimal trade-offs ( Harman,_2007_CITE) currently possible for heavily used applications"
"In all optimisation work, it is important to consider the appropriate point at which to deploy human judgement in an otherwise automated process ( Harman,_2007,_2010_CITE)"
"Servers continue to use significant amounts of power when they are idle; for example, Google report that idle power is generally never below 50% of peak ( Fan_et_al.,_2007_CITE)"
"To complicate matters, it is common practice to oversubscribe physical hardware ( Williams_et_al.,_2011_CITE), such that demand may in some circumstances be expected to exceed supply"
"Furthermore, the energy profile of an application and of a server appears to be highly variable and experimental studies investigating servers energy consumption have reported conflicting findings ( Barroso_and_H lzle,_2009;_Lee_and_Zomaya,_2012_CITE)."
"Lee and Zomaya also assume that f is a linear function, which is in conflict to that reported by Barroso_and_H lzle_(2009)_CITE."
This idea is similar to that of Emberson_and_Bate_(2010)_CITE in their SBSE work on allocating processes to processors in a multiprocessor system.
"Justafort_(2012)_CITE considers the impact at application level, for example, where Stillwell_et_al._(2012)_CITE optimise on heterogeneous platforms."
"Searching over a vector space could be performed using Simulated Annealing ( Kirkpatrick_et_al.,_1983_CITE), the technique used by Emberson and Bate."
Forrest_et_al._(2009)_CITE showed in their work on automatic patch fixing that sampling from a set of test cases can be more efficient than using an entire test suite
"One way to address this problem is to auction off unused resources, such as Amazon's Spot instances ( Amazon,_2012_CITE)"
"Ben-Yehuda_et_al._(2011)_CITE showed that spot instance prices appear to be set, not by supply and demand, but rather a randomised algorithm"
"For instance, the problems of requirements engineering ( Cheng_and_Atlee,_2007_CITE) and the associated SBSE research ( Zhang_et_al.,_2008_CITE), will not necessarily change fundamentally"
"One of the biggest changes can be expected in the area of SBSE for testing, known as Search Based Software Testing (SBST) ( McMinn,_2004;_Harman,_2007;_Ali_et_al.,_2010;_Harman_et_al.,_2012a_CITE)"
"In a similar manner, there is the possibility of rapidly forking a running VM instance ( Lagar-cavilla_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
Le_Goues_et_al._(2012)_CITE used the cloud to measure the cost of a bug fix
"For example, a common goal has been to refactor software to achieve a given quality in terms of cohesion or coupling metrics ( Lutz,_2001_CITE)."
"For example, consider the work of Carzaniga_et_al._(2008)_CITE, who used different paths through a system, such as similar API calls, to find a workaround for a given problem"
"In the financial modelling domain for example, Darley_and_Outkin_(2007)_CITE, were able to construct a very effective model of the markets which was used to predict the impact of Nasdaq stock market decimalisation"
"A possible solution to this problem has recently been proposed, in the form of Amortised Optimisation ( Yoo,_2012_CITE)"
"This is analogous to past use of island models in distribution optimisation algorithms ( Whitley,_2001_CITE)."
"Traceability provides for a logical connection between artifacts of the software development process ( Gotel_and_Finkelstein,_1994_CITE)"
"In three prior publications we discussed aspects of the approach, M der_et_al._(2008a)_CITE gave an initial overview of the approach, M der_et_al._(2008b)_CITE discussed technical details of one particular component of the approach, namely the development activity recognition, and M der_et_al._(2009a)_CITE referred to link update concepts and introduced different types of development activities according to the required update"
"An agreed methodology for traceability, specifying how to create, maintain and use traceability, is not generally available ( Aizenbud-Reshef_et_al.,_2006_CITE)"
"Nevertheless, common to all processes is the necessity to specify which artifacts should be related and how this information should be used to obtain a consistent set of traceability relations across developers ( D mges_and_Pohl,_1998_CITE)."
"Pinheiro_(2004)_CITE divides the production of traceability relations into perception, registration and maintenance"
"The majority of these approaches apply text mining and information retrieval techniques to identify candidate relations ( Alexander,_2002;_Antoniol_et_al.,_2002;_Marcus_and_Maletic,_2003;_Hayes_et_al.,_2003;_Lucia_et_al.,_2008_CITE)"
Aizenbud-Reshef_et_al._(2006)_CITE refer to maintenance as the most challenging aspect of traceability.
"A model can be defined as an abstraction of some real world object and, in the context of a development process, it refers to the product which is the subject of engineering ( OMG,_2003,_2010_CITE)"
"The ( OMG,_2010_CITE) provides a set of structural and behavioral diagrams that allow many facets of a development process to be modeled"
"An extension, the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) ( OMG,_2008_CITE), provides additional diagrams and options for systems development."
"Model-based development processes may be viewed as multiphase transformation processes from the initial problem statement to the final solution ( Jacobson_et_al.,_1999_CITE)"
"If this multiphase transformation process is carried out only once, entering each phase only when the preceding phase has been completed, it is a waterfall-like process ( Royce,_1987_CITE)"
"Most problems nowadays are too complex to be solved in this manner and state of the art development processes are iterative and incremental (eg, the Unified Process; Jacobson_et_al.,_1999_CITE)"
"Within the UML meta-model ( OMG,_2010_CITE), the representation of traceability relations is considered as a type of dependency with a given direction"
Arlow_and_Neustadt_(2005)_CITE state that a change to the independent element (supplier) may effect or supply information needed by the dependent element (client) and that the client in some way depends on the supplier
"A stereotype trace is applied to distinguish traceability relations from other dependencies that are part of the models ( Arlow_and_Neustadt,_2005;_Weilkiens,_2006_CITE)."
"A major problem that arises in model-based software development is ensuring that related models evolve consistently while the development proceeds ( Huzar_et_al.,_2004_CITE)"
Finkelstein_et_al._(1994)_CITE state that checking consistency between perspectives and the handling of inconsistency creates many interesting and difficult research problems
"Traceability can support this issue by propagating changes that happen to an element in one model to all its related elements in other models ( Aizenbud-Reshef_et_al.,_2006_CITE)."
Cleland-Huang_et_al._(2003)_CITE present an approach that can help maintain traceability called event-based traceability (EBT)
"Spanoudakis_et_al._(2004)_CITE present a rule-based approach for the automatic generation of traceability relations between documents, which specify either requirement statements or use cases (in structured natural language) and analysis object models"
Mens_et_al._(2005)_CITE describe an extension to the UML meta-model to support the versioning and evolution of UML models
Cleland-Huang_et_al._(2002)_CITE describe a concept for the recognition of change types applied to requirements as part of their EBT approach (see Section 2.2.1)
Engels_et_al._(2002)_CITE present a classification of UML model refinements to preserve consistency during the evolution of UML-RT models (a UML enhancement for real-time systems)
Hnatkowska_et_al._(2003)_CITE specify behavioral refinements in UML collaboration diagrams and describe how these relate to structural refinements
Maletic_et_al._(2005)_CITE describe an XML-based approach to support the evolution of traceability relations between models expressed in the XML (with no restriction to the content of the model)
"Shen_et_al._(2003)_CITE suggest an extension to the UML meta-model via specified stereotypes according to four types of refinement (addition, deletion, connection and disconnection)"
"Relevant changes that might require the maintenance of traceability are those that alter artifacts of related models ( Maletic_et_al.,_2005_CITE)"
"Such changes comprise a sequence of one or more incremental changes ( Cleland-Huang_et_al.,_2002_CITE)"
"We focused on structural UML diagrams as most practitioners interviewed about their traceability practice referred to related structural UML diagrams within their software development process ( M der_et_al.,_2009c_CITE)"
"The semi-formal nature of both UML and SysML models supports the recognition of changes, and their use is common in industry ( M der_et_al.,_2009c_CITE)"
"The focus on these kinds of models means that the approach is concerned solely with maintaining post-requirements traceability ( Gotel_and_Finkelstein,_1994_CITE)."
"The existence of an up-to-date traceability information model, defining permitted traceability relations for the project ( M der_et_al.,_2009d_CITE)"
"For that reason, an event configuration represented as a class diagram defines the element types of interest along with the properties that are needed to recognize defined development activities (see M der_et_al.,_2008b_CITE for further information)"
These development activity types correlate with those that have been identified by Cleland-Huang_et_al._(2002)_CITE for the evolution of requirements artifacts (see Section 2.2.1)
"This observation has also been made by Cleland-Huang_et_al._(2002)_CITE, where the authors decided to facilitate the recognition process by user support."
"Forward engineering processes that were studied include the Unified Process ( Jacobson_et_al.,_1999;_Kruchten,_2000;_Arlow_and_Neustadt,_2005_CITE), Fusion ( Coleman,_1994_CITE) and Quasar ( Russek,_2004;_Siedersleben,_2004_CITE)"
"Refactoring activities ( Fowler,_1999_CITE) were also studied and included in the list of activities"
"In addition, the discussion of systems design with UML of Lano_(2005)_CITE provided additional candidates for development activities"
"As a result of these studies, the current rule catalog for structural UML models comprises 38 development activities (13 apply to associations, 4 to inheritance, 4 to attributes, 2 to methods, 5 to classes, 6 to components and 4 to packages) defined as 19 rules with 67 alternatives ( M der,_2009_CITE)"
"The catalog has been improved multiple times and has been used in its current form during several studies and experiments ( M der_et_al.,_2008a,b,_2009a_CITE), one of them discussed in Section 6"
We published a list of all identified development activities and a list of all defined rules in the appendices of M der_(2009)_CITE
The concrete process of comparing events with masks has been discussed in M der_et_al._(2008b)_CITE.
Further information can be found in M der_et_al._(2008b)_CITE.
"For that reason, a rule editor was developed to assist with rule creation, editing and validation (see M der_et_al.,_2009b_CITE)"
"It is important that these expressions are satisfiable (the SAT problem; Du_et_al.,_1997_CITE)"
"Such reactive systems are built according to the Event Condition Action paradigm (ECA) ( van_Bemmel_et_al.,_2004_CITE)"
"As this approach is not intended to react to a single event, but to react to patterns over the event history, a much more sophisticated rule engine with Complex Event Processing (CEP) ( Luckham,_2002_CITE) was necessary"
"This has been developed as part of the prototype system that implements the approach (see M der_et_al.,_2008b,_2009b_CITE)."
"traceMAINTAINER is described more fully in M der_et_al._(2009b),_M der_et_al._(2008c)_CITE."
"The project had initially been developed as seminar work ( Dommasch_and_Duhme,_2004_CITE) and was reverse engineered and enhanced into a complete model-based development project for the Enterprise Architect modeling tool"
All diagrams of interest are shown in the appendices of M der_(2009)_CITE
The task descriptions and the questionnaires are available in the appendices of M der_(2009)_CITE.
"Except for the traceability information model, this is exactly the scenario that has been reported by nine of the ten interviewed companies in a survey paper ( M der_et_al.,_2009c_CITE)"
"Regarding use of a traceability information model, a major problem is the missing support for such definitions within common CASE tools ( Ritze,_2008_CITE)"
"While we cannot provide concrete figures, we can refer to the often-used figures that claim that 70% of a development's budget is spent on software maintenance ( Glass,_2002_CITE)"
"While the support of structural UML diagrams addresses a common scenario in industry ( M der_et_al.,_2009c_CITE), it would be desirable to extend the approach to other kinds of development model"
"Nevertheless, it was not the main focus of this work and a more sophisticated and selective procedure based on the available information about the change and its type, following the work of Cleland-Huang_et_al._(2003)_CITE, could be possible."
"The requirements traceability problem ( Gotel_and_Finkelstein,_1994_CITE) has many facets and it is unlikely that there will ever be a single approach that solves the whole problem, but much work has been done on this topic over the past decade that provides promising approaches to partial aspects"
"Different artifacts of the development process are often held in different tools and the support for traceability between these tools varies ( M der_et_al.,_2009c_CITE)"

Cheng and Mon [6]_CITE used the -cut of Level-1 fuzzy numbers to obtain the intervals and determine the fuzzy reliability of the serial system
"Chen [7]_CITE used fuzzy numbers to determine the fuzzy reliability of the two systems, whereas Singer [12]_CITE used LR-type fuzzy numbers to consider the fuzzy reliability problem"
"Furthermore, to ensure easy defuzzification, the signed distance proposed by Abbasbandy and Asady [1]_CITE must be considered and modified into the signed distance of an interval-valued fuzzy number"
"(Gorzalczany [9]_CITE; Deschrijver [8]_CITE) An interval-valued fuzzy set A (i-v fuzzy set) on R is derived by A {(x,[ A L(x), A U(x)])|x R},0 A L(x) A U(x) 1, x R"
Chen [7]_CITE used a triangular fuzzy number
"Therefore, the triangular fuzzy numbers used by Chen [7]_CITE are R A=R B=(0.00888,0.02,0.03112;1)R C=R D=(0.75552,0.80,0.84448;1)R E=(0.94434,1.00,1.05566;1)R F=R G=(0.04722,0.05,0.05278;1)R H=(0.00944,0.01,0.10560;1) Using Definition 8, we defuzzified R X(1) and obtained the estimated reliability of the system in the fuzzy sense as dR X(1),0 =0.137755"

Chen [7]_CITE used a fuzzy number that was used as a triangular fuzzy number in this study
"Cheng and Mon [6]_CITE considered the following: A (x)=0,xa3That is, A =(a1,a2,a3;1), where 0 1"
"P i= 0 1[ai1+(ai2-ai1) ,ai3-(ai3-ai2) ; ],i=1,2, ,n and P 1( )P 2( ) ( )P n= 0 1 i=1n((ai2-ai1) +ai1), i=1n(-(ai3-ai2) +ai3); Cheng and Mon [6]_CITE used only one in the decomposition to address the problem."
"Several models have been developed and integrated into computer simulators (FARSITE [1]_CITE, FireStation [2]_CITE, Wildfireanalyst [3]_CITE or CARDIN [4]_CITE) to estimate forest fire propagation"
"Taking into account that the forest fire simulator used is FARSITE, the wind field simulator chosen is WindNinja [5,6]_CITE, because it can accept the same input files as FARSITE and can generate wind field files that can be directly used by FARSITE"

"Life expectancy of men (women) has risen from 68 (76) years to 74 (80) years during the same time period ( European_Commission,_2007_CITE)"
"This is partly due to the fact that women and men are both working ( Tarricone_&_Tsouros,_2008_CITE)"
"Therefore, organizations providing home care services are inclined to optimize their activities in order to meet the constantly increasing demand for home care ( Koeleman,_Bhulai,_&_van_Meersbergen,_2012_CITE)"
"First of all, most works consider the total distance traveled or the routing costs of the nurses in the objective function (see eg Akjiratikarl,_Yenradee,_&_Drake,_2007;_Begur,_Miller,_&_Weaver,_1997;_Eveborn,_Flisberg,_&_R nnqvist,_2006;_Eveborn,_R nnqvist,_Einarsd ttir,_Eklund,_L den,_&_Almroth,_2009;_Hiermann,_Prandtstetter,_Rendl,_Puchinger,_&_Raidl,_2015;_Mankowska,_Meisel,_&_Bierwirth,_2014;_Rasmussen,_Justesen,_Dohn,_&_Larsen,_2012;_Trautsamwieser,_Gronalt,_&_Hirsch,_2011_CITE), often in addition to a number of other terms"
"Trautsamwieser_et al._(2011)_CITE consider seven different terms in the objective function and Hiermann_et al._(2015)_CITE consider as many as 13 (see Table 1, column # OF terms )."
"Nickel,_Schr der,_and_Steeg_(2012)_CITE look at weekly schedules and link them to the operational planning problem"

"Since the latter functions are piecewise linear, they can be optimized efficiently (despite being non-convex) using dynamic programming ( Vidal_et al.,_2015_CITE)"

"According to the 2009 NIST MBGC report [1]_CITE, face recognition remains a challenging endeavor on account of variations in poses, illumination, occlusion, and aging"
"Moreover, commercial face recognition software is publicly available, such as Google Picasa and Apple iPhoto [2]_CITE."
"Wright et al proposed use of sparse representation for face recognition; it can handle illumination, expression variance, and occlusion [5]_CITE"
"Based on this model, a transfer learning method was proposed for combining ample cross-domain source data [7]_CITE"
"In [8]_CITE, the Facebook AI Research group proposed the DeepFace framework, which uses deep networks for face verification"
"Regarding 2D methods, a Markov random field (MRF) is used to find correspondences between a frontal face and profile faces [9,10]_CITE"
Lucas Kanade is another effective 2D normalization method [11]_CITE; it calculates the transformation parameters for each of the correspondences of two images.
The 3D morphable method is an effective normalization method [12]_CITE that builds a 3D general model and fits it to a probe 2D face
Li et al [13]_CITE synthesized a probe face by estimating 3D displacement fields from a 3D face database
Tied-factor analysis has been proposed for representing a non-frontal face by a pose-contingent linear transformation of identifiers [14]_CITE
"Another subspace, called the discriminant-coupled latent subspace, has been proposed [15]_CITE"
One-shot similarity (OSS) and two-shot similarity (TSS) are pose-insensitive classifiers [16]_CITE; they require a third-party dataset with no probe and gallery faces in it
"Similarly, cross-pose face recognition likewise requires a third-party dataset [17]_CITE"
"Recently, neural networks [18]_CITE and deep learning [19]_CITE have been applied for calculating the pose-invariant features"

"In order for organisations to use and digest heterogeneous data and uncover the untold business patterns, there is a growing interest to develop techniques that investigate complex data phenomena and facilitate better data interoperability ( Doan,_Halevy,_&_Ives,_2012;_Doan,_Noy,_&_Halevy,_2004;_Duckham_&_Worboys,_2005;_Huang,_Lin,_&_Chan,_2012;_Jiang,_Zhang,_Tang,_&_Nie,_2015;_Lenzerini,_2002_CITE)"
"Among various techniques developed, ontology research is one discipline that can deal with data heterogeneity and improve data sharing ( Kalfoglou_&_Schorlemmer,_2003;_Mate_et_al.,_2015_CITE; Noy,_2004_CITE)"
"The work reported here is a follow on research of Beck_et_al._(2013_CITE), Fu_and_Cohn_(2008a)_CITE and Fu_and_Cohn_(2008b_CITE)"
"A common definition of an ontology is that it is a formal, explicit specification of a domain of discourse ( Gruber,_1993_CITE)"
"As it provides a shared understanding and explicit specification of a domain, an ontology is considered to have a key role to play in data integration ( Bakhtouchi,_Bellatreche,_&_Ait-Ameur,_2011;_Bian,_Zhang,_&_Peng,_2011;_Noy,_2004;_Uschold_&_Gr ninger,_2004;_Yu_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"Most methods are based on the traditional knowledge engineering approach ( Brockmans_et_al.,_2006_CITE; Pinto_&_Martins,_2004;_Sure,_Tempich,_&_Vrandecic,_2006_CITE)"
"As developing ontologies from scratch is an expensive process to perform, there has been increasing interest in reusing or merging existing ontologies (or other knowledge structures such as thesauri) that are developed independently in different applications ( Duong,_Truong,_&_Nguyen,_2012;_Truong_&_Nguyen,_2012;_Xie,_Liu,_&_Guan,_2011;_Yang,_2011_CITE)"
"However, as an ontology captures richer data semantics than traditional database schemas, the methods for finding mappings tend to exploit these extra data semantics ( Kalfoglou_&_Schorlemmer,_2003;_Nguyen,_2007;_Rodriguez_&_Egenhofer,_2003;_Truong_&_Nguyen,_2012_CITE)"
"For example, in Noy_and_Musen_(2000_CITE) a tool has been developed to use linguistic similarity matches between concepts for initiating mappings, and then use the underlying ontological structures (classes, slots, facets) to suggest a set of heuristics for identifying further matches between the ontologies"
"In Duong_and_Jo_(2012_CITE), a method has been proposed to mapping ontological concepts using propagating Priorly Matchable Concepts"
"In Nguyen_(2006_CITE), an approach has been proposed to resolve three levels of ontology conflicts: instant level, concept level and relation level, using consensus method"
"The techniques developed in Doan,_Madhavan,_Domingos,_&_Halevy_(2003_CITE) and Spohr,_Hollink,_and_Cimiano_(2011_CITE) employs learning based techniques to find ontology mappings"
"Of particular interest here is research based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) ( Ganter_&_Wille,_1999;_Ganter_et_al.,_2005;_Wille,_1982_CITE)"
"As a result, FCA has been attracting great interest to support systematic, semi-automated development and integration of ontologies ( Bai_&_Zhou,_2011;_Formica,_2006;_He_&_Wang,_2011;_Nanda,_Simpson,_Kumara,_&_Shooter,_2006;_Xia,_2013_CITE)"
"For example, in Rouane,_Valtchev,_Sahraoui,_&_Huchard_(2004_CITE) ontological hierarchy merging is studied in the framework of FCA by taking into account of both taxonomic and other semantic relationships of ontologies"
A method FCA-MERGE has been developed in Stumme_and_Maedche_(2001_CITE) to use FCA to support ontology integration
"In Zhao,_Wang,_and_Halang_(2006_CITE) a similarity method has been introduced to map ontology concepts basing on Rough Set and Formal Concept Analysis theory"
"In Chen,_Bau,_and_Yeh_(2011_CITE) authors proposed a method that combines WordNet and Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis techniques for merging ontologies"
"FCA theory was developed in Wille_(1982_CITE) and a typical task that FCA can perform is data analysis, making the conceptual structure of the data visible and accessible ( Ganter_&_Wille,_1999;_Ganter_et_al.,_2005_CITE)"
"In order for FCA theory to be applied to a many valued context, it needs to be unfolded into a one valued context through conceptual scaling ( Ganter_&_Wille,_1999_CITE)"

"Hence we believe that establishing explicit trust in social networks (eg, [44,45]_CITE), respectively becoming aware of distrust, will become a significant factor in team formation."
Especially social networks that lack a rich-club structure (see [18]_CITE) are prone to produce compositions of non-connected experts

"A detailed description of turbulence spectra is needed to model and quantify many aspects of engineering flows eg the behavior of turbulent mixing, coalescence and break-up phenomena in chemical engineering processes [1]_CITE"
"The aforementioned phenomena usually occur very fast, often within a few milliseconds [2]_CITE, and this time scale is equal to or smaller than the life time of turbulent vortices for many engineering applications [3]_CITE"
"Thus, the interaction cannot be modeled using the statistical mean properties of turbulence eg turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate [3 5]_CITE"
The understanding of turbulence is a part of wish list suggested at Turbulence Colloquium in Marseille 2011 for current and future studies [6]_CITE
In addition the vortex number distributions should be used to derive expressions relating to the fractional rate of surface renewal and mass transfer coefficients across gas liquid and solid liquid interfaces [9]_CITE
"u is the mean fluctuating velocity of turbulent vortices of size and it is theoretically given by [10]_CITE, (2)u C1/2( )1/3,where C is the functional parameter of the turbulent structure"
"(2) and (3) into Eq (1) the number density of turbulent vortices of sizes between and + d is given by (4)n =C1 4,and (5)C1=24 (2 )5/3C.The experimental data shows that the constant is 1.5 approximately [11]_CITE"
Risso and Fabre [12]_CITE have used the same value as given by Pope [13]_CITE and Lasheras [14]_CITE has pointed out that there is a range for C from about 2 8.2
The coefficient CS is determined using the dynamic model [13]_CITE.
It is important that the LES simulations are run for at least a few mean flow residence times to become statistically steady [16]_CITE
"When 80% of the turbulent kinetic energy is resolved, the LES simulation can be considered well-resolved [17]_CITE."
The vortices are stretched in the streamline direction with an aspect ratio in the range 3 5 [18]_CITE
Su et al [19]_CITE and Davidson [20]_CITE used two point correlations of velocities to quantify how many cells are resolving the large structures
"These criteria includes the iso-surfaces of vorticity, stream lines, Helicity, Q-criterion, complex eigenvalues of the velocity gradient tensor, 2, swirl strength and pressure minimum [21]_CITE"
Chakraborty and et al [22]_CITE showed that the Q-criterion and 2 almost give the same flow structures.
"In order to visualize a wide range of vortices even the weakest one in the bulk, the Q-criterion can be normalized with respect to the vorticity [18]_CITE."
"Recently, an analysis of the turbulent kinetic energy on a 2D plane of a 3D LES simulation revealed that less than 40% of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) on the plane would be captured within the structures identified by the lowest possible cut off Q-criterion [18]_CITE"

"The applications are of a wide range and significance, including gesture recognition and human computer interaction ( Bilal_et_al.,_2012;_Radlak_and_Smolka,_2012;_Nalepa_et_al.,_2014_CITE), objectionable content filtering ( Lee_et_al.,_2007_CITE), image retrieval ( Kruppa_et_al.,_2002_CITE), image coding using regions of interest ( Chen_et_al.,_2003_CITE), and many more."

"Cheddad_et_al._(2009)_CITE proposed reducing the RGB color space to a single dimension, in which the decision rules are defined."
"Skin color can be modeled using a number of techniques, including the Gaussian mixture model ( Greenspan_et_al.,_2001_CITE) and the Bayesian classifier ( Jones_and_Rehg,_2002_CITE)"
Lee_et_al._(2007)_CITE proposed a method based on a multi-layer perceptron extracting lighting features from an analyzed image to adjust the skin detector
An approach for adapting the segmentation threshold in the probability map based on the assumption that a skin region is coherent and should have homogenous textural features was introduced by Phung_et_al._(2003)_CITE
This method was further extended by Zhang_et_al._(2004)_CITE by involving the artificial neural network (ANN) for estimating an optimal acceptance threshold
The ANN was also used for adaptation by Yang_et_al._(2010)_CITE
A method for a dynamic model adaptation based on observed changes in the histogram extracted from a tracked skin region was proposed by Soriano_et_al._(2000)_CITE
Motion detectors for the skin color model adaptation were explored by Dadgostar_and_Sarrafzadeh_(2006)_CITE
"Analysis of facial regions for effective adaptation of the skin model to local conditions was investigated by Fritsch_et_al._(2002);_Stern_and_Efros,_2002;_Kawulok,_2008;_Kawulok_et_al.,_2013_and_Yogarajah_et_al.,_2012_CITE."
"In the approach proposed by Wang_et_al._(1985)_CITE segmentation in the RGB and YCgCb color spaces is enhanced by analyzing various textural features, including contrast, entropy, homogeneity and more, extracted using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)"
"Additionally, the time complexity of calculating GLCM is proportional to O(g2) ( Clausi_and_Jernigan,_1998_CITE), where g is the number of gray levels of the input grayscale image."
"Simple textural features were used to boost the performance of a number of skin detection techniques and classifiers, including the ANN ( Taqa_and_Jalab,_2010_CITE), non-parametric density estimation of skin and non-skin classes ( Zafarifar_et_al.,_2010_CITE), Gaussian mixture models ( Ng_and_Pun,_2011_CITE), and many more ( Forsyth_and_Fleck,_1999,_Conci_et_al.,_2008,_Fotouhi_et_al.,_2009,_Abin_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Although the color-based skin models can be efficiently adapted to a given image, it was proved by Zhu_et_al._(2004)_CITE that it is hardly possible to separate skin from non-skin pixels using such approaches"
"A number of skin segmentation techniques emerged based on this observation: Kruppa_et_al._(2002)_CITE assumed that the skin blobs are of an elliptical shape, a threshold hysteresis was applied by Argyros_and_Lourakis_(2004)_CITE and recently by Baltzakis_et_al._(2012)_CITE"
Conditional random fields were used by Chenaoua_and_Bouridane_(2006)_CITE to exploit spatial properties of skin regions
An approach based on the cellular automata for determining skin regions was proposed by Abin_et_al._(2009)_CITE.
The analysis of skin probability map domain for skin segmentation using a controlled diffusion was proposed by del_Solar_and_Verschae_(2004)_CITE
"In our earlier research ( Kawulok,_2010_CITE) we introduced an energy-based technique for skin blobs analysis"
"Recently, we proposed to use the distance transform in a combined domain (DTCD) of hue, luminance and skin probability ( Kawulok,_2013_CITE)"
"In order to determine which textural features offer the best discrimination between the skin and non-skin regions, we adapted a framework which we developed for the image colorization purposes ( Kawulok_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
The proposed algorithm was compared with the Gabor wavelet-based texture analysis method proposed by Jiang_et_al._(2007)_CITE
"In order to provide a thorough comparison, we also investigated how the wavelet-based method behaves when the textural features are extracted from the skin probability maps rather than from the luminance as proposed in the original work of Jiang_et_al._(2007)_CITE."
"In the case of the DSA ( del_Solar_and_Verschae,_2004_CITE), the ROC curves were obtained by applying different values of the diffusion threshold ( ), explained earlier in Section 2"
"Traditionally, the technique has been applied to test inputs for procedural programs, such as those written in C ( McMinn,_2004_CITE)"
"More recently, the technique has been applied to the generation of unit test cases for object-oriented software ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2013b_CITE)"
"The EvoSuite tool ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2011_CITE) uses Genetic Algorithms to generate a whole test suite, composed of a number of test cases"
"Although empirical experiments have shown that it is practically usable on a wide range of programs ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2012_CITE), Genetic Algorithms are a global search technique, which tend to induce macro-changes on the test suite"
"Search-based testing applies meta-heuristic search techniques to the task of test case generation ( McMinn,_2004_CITE)"
"Different types of local search algorithms exist, including simulated annealing, tabu search, iterated local search and variable neighborhood search (see Gendreau_and_Potvin,_2010_CITE, for example, for further details)"
"The Alternating Variable Method (AVM) is a local search technique similar to hill climbing, and was introduced by Korel_(1990)_CITE"
"For example, to generate tests for specific branches to achieve branch coverage of a program a common fitness function ( McMinn,_2004_CITE) integrates the approach level (number of unsatisfied control dependencies) and the branch distance (estimation of how close a branching condition is to being evaluated as desired)"
"Such search techniques have not only been applied in the context of primitive datatypes, but also to test object-oriented software using method sequences ( Tonella,_2004;_Fraser_and_Zeller,_2012_CITE)."
"Yao_et al._(2005)_CITE report no difference between the two types of learning, whereas other experiments showed that Baldwinian learning may lead to better results but takes significantly longer ( Whitley_et al.,_1994_CITE)"
"Harman_and_McMinn_(2010)_CITE analyzed the effects of global and local search, and concluded that MAs achieve better performance than global search and local search"
"In the context of generating unit tests for object-oriented code, Arcuri_and_Yao_(2007)_CITE combined a GA with hill climbing to form an MA when generating unit tests for container classes"
Liaskos_and_Roper_(2008)_CITE also confirmed that the combination of global and local search algorithms leads to improved coverage when generating test cases for classes
"Baresi_et al._(2010)_CITE also use a hybrid evolutionary search in their TestFul test generation tool, where at the global search level a single test case aims to maximize coverage, while at the local search level the optimization targets individual branch conditions"
For details on the mutation operators we refer the reader to Fraser_and_Arcuri_(2013b)_CITE.
"To offer guidance on string based branches we replace calls to the String.equals method with a custom method that returns a distance measurement ( Li_and_Fraser,_2011_CITE)"
"This transformation is an instance of testability transformation ( Harman_et al.,_2004_CITE), which is commonly applied to improve the guidance offered by the search landscape of programs"
"Kapfhammer_et al.,_2013_CITE): distance(s1,s2)=|length(s1) length(s2)|+ i=0min(length(s1),length(s2))distance(s1[i],s2[i])"
"Considering the high costs of fitness evaluations in the test generation scenario, a generally preferred choice ( El-Mihoub_et al.,_2006_CITE) is Lamarckian learning, ie, the local search changes the genotype and its fitness value, rather than just the fitness value"
"A common implementation of MAs applies this learning immediately after reproduction ( Moscato,_1989_CITE)"
"One possible strategy to select individuals for local search is to apply it to the worst individuals ( El-Mihoub_et al.,_2006_CITE), which supports exploration"
"The adaptation rate a updates the probability p after a successful (ie, fitness was improved) local search as follows: (1)p=APTARANORMALmin(p a,1)whereas on unsuccessful local search it is updated to: (2)p=pa.Optionally, EvoSuite implements a strategy where local search is restricted to those statements where a mutation in the reproduction phase has led to a fitness change ( Galeotti_et al.,_2013_CITE)."
"During all these runs, EvoSuite was configured using the optimal configuration determined in our previous experiments on tuning ( Arcuri_and_Fraser,_2013_CITE)"
"One thing that is clearly visible in Table 3 is that seeding, as expected ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2012_CITE), leads to higher results"
"This is different from the result of our initial experiment ( Fraser_et al.,_2013_CITE), where the best configuration used seeding, small population size (five individuals), low rate of local search (every 75 generations), and a small budget of five fitness evaluations for local search"
"This is a common problem that in Machine Learning is called overfitting ( Mitchell,_1997_CITE)"
"To reduce the threats of this possible issue, we applied a k-fold cross validation on our case study (for more details, see for example ( Mitchell,_1997_CITE))"
"However, usually the best parameter configuration is strongly related to the testing budget ( Arcuri_and_Fraser,_2013_CITE)"
"( Galeotti_et al.,_2013_CITE)) and will thus only select some of the cases where local search can lead to an improvement"
"A particular aspect of this real-life, unbiased sample of classes is that the problems it represents are quite different to those considered as difficult search problems ( Fraser_and_Arcuri,_2012_CITE): for example, a large share of the classes have environmental dependencies that make high coverage with EvoSuite impossible"
"More sophisticated attacks may greatly increase their chance of success by targeting a much smaller pool of recipients with a personalised ploy ( Jagatic_et al.,_2007_CITE)."
"Current research suggests that the effectiveness of such attacks can be greatly increased through the use of open source intelligence (OSINT) to boost the effectiveness of the deceptive ploys delivered in an attack ( Jagatic_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
"Methods by which such OSINT data may be used to increase effectiveness in this manner include (but are not limited to): selection of vulnerable personalities, inclusion of ploys personally attractive to the target, and impersonation of a person in authority ( Huber_et al.,_2009_CITE)."
"Existing research has demonstrated the social engineering risks posed by such OSINT data ( Ball_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"However, this normally relies on labour intensive manual analysis ( Creese_et al.,_2012_CITE), which is impractical and poses a high cost to a potential attacker"
"Other techniques rely on active engagement with potential targets to elicit information through zombie profiles or misleading friend requests ( Scheelen_et al.,_2012_CITE) and hence risk detection prior to an attack being launched"
"The nearest approximation we are aware of is Scheelen_et al._(2012)_CITE, who investigated a single company by connecting with followers on LinkedIn, where the social media structure is based around employment."
Huber_et al._(2009)_CITE make use of an organisation's Facebook presence to automatically identify and target its employees
Ball_et al._(2012)_CITE detail how open source information can be used to construct spear-phishing attacks on an organisation's employees
"Scheelen_et al._(2012)_CITE attempt to map out a company's structure from online sources, including gathering information for social engineering"
Obvious features often work well: Perito_et al._(2011)_CITE focused on the identifiability of usernames
"Irani_et al._(2009)_CITE suggest that a record-matching approach to the problem can be fruitful, with identifiers like last name, birth year and country unlikely to change across records"
"Working with a wider range of features, Malhotra_et al._(2012)_CITE design an ensemble classifier, with subclassifiers relying on individual features such as profile pictures and usernames."
"Goga_et al._(2013)_CITE exploit innocuous social media profile information such as time-stamps, geographical location and writing styles to match user profiles, demonstrating that even where usernames and other traditional identifiers are disguised, users can still be identified based on their usage of the media"
"Chen_et al._(2012)_CITE detail some of these vulnerabilities, and demonstrate that additional details such as phone numbers can be better retrieved when multiple profiles of the target can be linked."
"Kontaxis_et al._(2011)_CITE describes the profile cloning attack which lets social engineers use existing information on one person to imitate them on a service on which they do not have an account, along with a detection strategy for this."
"The general identity resolution approach of pairwise comparison is supported even more broadly by similar approaches in other domains of security analytics ( Zhang_et al.,_2016_CITE)."
"Our sample size is comparable to other qualitative studies (eg Ashenden_and_Sasse_2013_CITE), which uses 5 in-depth interviews with CISOs)"
"Each interviewee held internationally recognised certification in the domain area, reaching a minimum level of CREST CRT , allowing level of expertise to be compared and verified to international standards ( Knowles_et al.,_2016_CITE)"
"They can be highly indicative of writing style ( Koppel_and_Schler,_2003_CITE)"
"To date this focus has largely been attributed to technical shortcomings, demonstrated in the sharp rise of disclosed vulnerabilities ( Kaspersky_Lab,_2015_CITE), and neglecting the importance of social and organisational factors"
"An initial step towards understanding the potential impact of social engineering on ICS was discussed by Green_et al._(2015)_CITE; however this work focuses solely on malicious emails, with vulnerability assessments achieved through the use of interview data."
"The availability of geo-location data is also significant for these attacks, as recent work demonstrates ( Gan_and_Jenkins,_2015_CITE)."
"This could be combined with more active countermeasures, such as phishing email susceptibility tests as described by Finn_and_Jakobsson_(2007)_CITE, or by creating honeypot social media accounts in a similar manner to that described by Lee et al for uncovering social spammers ( Lee_et al.,_2010_CITE)"
"Furthermore, Kotson_and_Schulz_(2015)_CITE and Dewan et al (2014) propose that organisations could use natural language processing techniques to maintain awareness of their online footprint, to be compared with received phishing emails, allowing identification of collection of OSINT by an attacker, and potential early warning of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)"
"We are already aware that better-performing feature sets are available for cross-platform identity resolution (eg Goga_et al._(2013)_CITE), and these would be fruitful areas for improvement."
Human motion estimation is one of the most important areas of computer vision study [1 11]_CITE
"Previous studies have shown that the performance of motion estimation is highly dependent on the quality of motion data as well as the algorithm that is developed for modeling and estimation of the model [1,4,8,9,11]_CITE"
"The approaches to motion estimation are biomechanical based [5,7]_CITE, silhouette based [2,3,6,11,12]_CITE and image based [1,4,8 10]_CITE"
"The methods used for estimation include cross-entropy regularization [1]_CITE, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) [8]_CITE, hierarchical fitting [9]_CITE and human pose recovery [10]_CITE."
Classification methods are often used to recognize the motion activities based on various classification methods [13]_CITE or classifiers for a specific action class [14]_CITE
"Different classification methods have been successfully used in the literature, including feature-reduced Gaussian [15]_CITE, image-based reconstruction [16]_CITE, support vector machine [17,18]_CITE, time frequency analysis [19]_CITE, kernel-based representation [20]_CITE, RBF neural network [21]_CITE and random decision forests [22]_CITE."
"The model is applied to short temporal daily activities include walking, running, and jumping obtained from publicly available video [25 27]_CITE and experimental captures of Yoga motion activity"
"Typically, motion postures in the whole time duration are framed in image snapshots similar to those presented in Wang and Baciu [1]_CITE, Tong et al [4]_CITE, Zhang et al [8]_CITE, Shen et al [9]_CITE and Hofmann and Gavrila [10]_CITE"
"Instead of using the point-cluster technique and the Kalman filter approach as in the case of Wolf and Senesh [7]_CITE, we use a polynomial fitting approach"
Polynomial fitting has been used in the estimation of air quality [28]_CITE and for operator prediction in image processing [29]_CITE
"In addition, classification performance is compared between the actual and estimated model data aided by the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software [30]_CITE"
Human motion is often represented by the original motion frame or by representing the original motion frames with a parametric or probabilistic model [31]_CITE
"By creating parameterized motions, human action can be altered based on momentary moods that describe emotions such as happiness and sadness [32]_CITE"
"At the same time, the motion style can also be modified by adjusting the stylistic parameter as in the work by Brand and Hertzmann [33]_CITE, in which a statistical model was introduced to generate new motion sequences based on the number of stylistic degrees of freedom"
"On the other hand, motion estimation is the process of estimating the configuration of the underlying kinematic or skeletal articulation structure of a person [34]_CITE"
"In the past, different models have been proposed to simplify captured motion matching, including sticks to indicate the human skeleton as well as ellipsoids and cylinders to represent solid human models [35]_CITE"
"By using the simplified model, motion estimation can be analyzed via different approaches such as human gait motion [36,37]_CITE, silhouette-based estimation [2,3,6,11,12,38]_CITE, biomechanical-based estimation [5,7]_CITE, and image-based estimation [1,4,8 10]_CITE, while other interesting works employ motion style transformations [39,40]_CITE"
"For instance, Veeraraghavan et al [36]_CITE created a shape-based recognition system for gait motion while Zhang et al [37]_CITE proposed a visual gait generative model (VGGM) and a kinematic gait generative model (KGGM) to represent part or whole gait modelling"
A two-stage Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) inference algorithm was implemented by Zhang et al [37]_CITE using part-based gait estimation
G d kbay et al [38]_CITE demonstrated that the human silhouette can be labeled using a model-based approach
"However, Rosenhahn et al [2]_CITE reported that silhouette information is insufficient for estimating the model correctly, as the extracted silhouette is hard to determine"
"In addition, Shen et al [12]_CITE used a Gaussian process to study the low-dimensional manifold of visual input data to reconstruct the corrupted silhouette for motion estimation"
Luo et al [11]_CITE proved that multi-view video is efficient in solving high-dimensional space problems and estimating a 3D surface in a temporal sequence
"For this purpose, Xiao et al [5]_CITE performed an optical motion data capture via a marker-based approach"
"Wolf and Senesh [7]_CITE, on the other hand, proposed a numerical model with no consideration for mechanical properties"
"Of all of the approaches, the image-based approach is the most common method for motion estimation; an example is the monocular image sequence, a model-based approach whereby the object shape is employed in motion estimation, and an independent method is used for a priori shaped models [1]_CITE"
"An example of object shape employment in model estimation was presented by Tong et al [4]_CITE, who estimated the joint and global location parameters of a human pose based on a monocular image using the deterministic nonlinear constraint optimization method"
"Meanwhile, Shen et al [9]_CITE proposed unconstrained motion estimation using a single frame"
"In addition, an optical flow method to estimate the motion of gestures was proposed by Zhang et al [8]_CITE"
"The independent method to shape models is reported in Hofmann and Gavrila [10]_CITE, who combined probabilistic single-frame pose recovery, temporal integration and texture model adaptation to estimate 3D upper body movements"
"Despite the low-level feature discussed by Kim and Park [42]_CITE, Benick and Juri ica [43]_CITE and Long and Wu [44]_CITE, the middle-level features that consider points and strokes are more informative compared to the edge feature from the low-level feature [45]_CITE"
Middle-level features are usually connected local features and global features that represent complex motion activity [46]_CITE
"For instance, Campos et al [47]_CITE and Fotiadou and Nikolaidis [48]_CITE used a popular middle-level feature in action recognition referred to as Bag of Words (BoW)"
"Meanwhile, Josinski et al [49]_CITE used the features extracted from spatial trajectories for gait motion recognition"
"In addition, a discriminative feature was proposed by Wang et al [50]_CITE to reduce the computational expense in action recognition"
"Whereas the studies on low-level motion focus on a single type of motion activity, Bruderlin and Williams [51]_CITE proposed a time-warping method as a non-linear method to combine different movements and control the speed of motion."
"However, recent works [4,5,37,39,40]_CITE have shown that human body posture coordinate data analysis is worth further investigation, particularly from a data mining perspective"
"Classification analysis was attempted in human motion studies by Zhou et al [15]_CITE, Raskin et al [52]_CITE, Bodor et al [16]_CITE, Nanni et al [17]_CITE, Orovi et al [19]_CITE, Lin and Hsieh [20]_CITE, Etemad et al [53]_CITE, Etemad and Arya [21]_CITE, Saripalle et al [18]_CITE, Deng et al [22]_CITE and Guan et al [54]_CITE"
"For instance, Zhou et al [15]_CITE performed feature-reduced Gaussian process classification to recognize articulated and deformable human actions"
The Gaussian process was used by Raskin et al [52]_CITE for dimensionality reduction and to improve the ability to track an object in high-dimensional space
"On the other hand, Bodor et al [16]_CITE classified human motions using image-based reconstruction"
"Nanni et al [17]_CITE and Saripalle et al [18]_CITE proposed methods using support vector machine for three orthogonal planes of motion data and posturography data, respectively"
Orovi et al [19]_CITE classified arm movements based on time frequency analysis of radar data
"Other studies reported human motion classification using Kernel-based representation [20]_CITE, ANN [53]_CITE, RBF neural networks [21]_CITE, random decision forests [22]_CITE and pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensor [54]_CITE"
"Recent human motion classification works [18,20 22,54]_CITE applied the classification method to the available or captured motion data, but the authors did not classify estimated matching motions"
"Following previous works by Tong et al [4]_CITE, Shen et al [9]_CITE, Hofmann and Gavrila [10]_CITE and Luo et al [11]_CITE, where the initial pose is used as the first frame in the motion estimation process, our work focuses on a guided initial stick figure as the precedent model to estimate the subsequent temporal model, as detailed in Sections 3 and 4."
"Typically, the human model is expressed as simple rigid objects connected by multiple joints [4,5,9,11,37,38,55]_CITE"
"However, polynomial fitting is only able to generate precise approximation in short intervals, where the large interval will cause the approximation to oscillate widely [56]_CITE"
"As stated by Yoo et al [57]_CITE, 2D motion data are based on intuition and able to define the posture faster for computer animation"
Another approach that is similar to the polynomial fitting adopted here is the piecewise polynomial that is commonly used in the temperature data of heat transfer [58]_CITE
"Following Hoshino et al [59]_CITE, Souvenir and Parrigan [60]_CITE and Eichner et al [61]_CITE, the image files were transformed based on the most fundamental assumption that human motions can be ideally modeled as 2D rigid body segments"
"Therefore, the data elimination cum regression imputation approach as reported in Chan et al [62]_CITE is applied to eliminate and impute the missing data"
"As discussed in Etemad et al [63]_CITE, the synthesis of human motion in animation is required to maintain perceptual accuracy"
Foot skating refers to the error that occurs in animation whereby the feet slide or float on the ground [64]_CITE
The collective terminology of simulated security assessments uses the notion of simulation as it is established by Such_et al._(2016_CITE) in their definition of information assurance techniques
"We do not, however, restrict ourselves to recommending only formal standards, and utilise the broader definition of standardisation offered by De_Vries_(1999)_CITE: activity of establishing and recording a limited set of solutions to actual or potential matching problems, directed at benefits for the party or parties involved, balancing their needs and intending and expecting that these solutions will be repeatedly or continuously used, during a certain period, by a substantial number of the parties for whom they are meant."
"The benefits of standardisation have been widely discussed, with links to increases in productivity, globalisation, exports, and general economic growth ( Blind_et al.,_2010;_Swann,_2000,_2010_CITE), as well as the facilitation of innovation ( Blind,_2013_CITE)"
"Standards aid public procurement in decision making and risk management, but individuals involved with public procurement need to provide a greater input into the development of standards from the early stages ( Blind,_2013_CITE)"
"A requirement for action was identified which led to the publication of a preliminary white paper ( Knowles_et al.,_2015_CITE)"
"Software security best practices were discussed by McGraw_(2004)_CITE, emphasising the importance of integrating security into the SDLC, in particular the use of penetration testing"
"A similar emphasis was placed by van_Wyk_and_McGraw_(2005_CITE) who outline various touchpoints (activities) in the SDLC to achieve this, including code review during implementation (a derivative assurance technique ( Such_et al.,_2015_CITE) of penetration testing) and penetration testing during configuration and deployment"
"A further study by Arkin_et al._(2005_CITE) focused specifically on software penetration testing, which emphasises the use of tools during the SDLC (eg, static and dynamic analysis tools), along with the importance of contextualising assessments according to perceived risk posture."
"Geer_and_Harthorne_(2002_CITE) highlight the contradictory drivers for penetration tests, which arise through clients desiring advertisable (in the context of demonstrating security to stakeholders) yet meaningful findings, and providers of services wanting to primarily succeed in the engagement's objectives (ie, to discover flaws)"
"The importance of penetration testing being only one part of a wider security risk management programme was stressed by Midian_(2002_CITE), while also introducing common issues found during assessments"
"The use of counterfactuals (ie, what-if scenarios) in the process of security reasoning is explored by Herley_and_Pieters_(2015_CITE), and concludes that despite their challenges they are a necessary evil"
"Tang_(2014_CITE) emphasises the importance of organisational standards, and proposes that procurers should look for companies certified by the Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG 1 1CESG is the information security arm of the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).), IT Health Check Service (CHECK), the Council of Registered Ethical Security Testers (CREST), or ISO 17025 (for testing laboratories), and also have ISO/IEC 27001"
The requirement for CREST certification is also proposed by Yeo_(2013_CITE)
"A high-level introduction to each, along with other standards and individual qualifications in the UK, is provided by Xynos_et al._(2010_CITE)"
"An early paper by Pfleeger_et al._(1989_CITE) outlined such a methodology, while proposing breaking systems into objects that undergo transactions"
"A four element methodology (planning, discovery, exploit, reporting) was proposed by Bechtsoudis_and_Sklavos_(2012_CITE) who further describe a case study to identify common security issues and their implications"
"Goel_and_Mehtre_(2015_CITE) provide a basic introduction to the importance of vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, along with a linear methodology"
The modelling of penetration tests using petri nets has been explored by McDermott_(2000_CITE)
"Thompson_(2005_CITE) provides discussion on penetration testing across three areas: building a test plan (eg, in relation to a threat model), executing this plan (eg, in terms of the types of testing, such as dependency testing), and the output of this process (eg, having clear, detailed reproducible exploit scenarios)"
"Geer_and_Harthorne_(2002_CITE) also discussed five aspects of application penetration testing: why (eg, motivations for testing), who (eg, assessor characteristics), what (eg, the testing methodology), where (eg, in terms of application subsystems), and when (eg, at which point in the SDLC)"
"One exception to this can be found in the work on social engineering by Dimkov_et al.,_(2010_CITE), which proposes two methodologies: one which measures the environment surrounding a target asset, and does not involve social engineering the asset owner, and a further methodology which is more general, where the asset owner is in scope and unaware of the assessment."
A study by Guard_et al._(2015_CITE) assessed the characteristics of students most suited to conducting penetration tests within testbed environments
Skillset requirements and career development of penetration testers were discussed at a high-level by Caldwell_(2011_CITE)
The challenges of designing information security courses that have potentially damaging consequences were examined by Logan_and_Clarkson_(2005_CITE) who identified a need for greater emphasis on the integration of ethics into courses
"This need was also proposed by Saleem_(2006_CITE) and Pashel_(2006_CITE), both of whom provided a short analysis on teaching penetration testing, where the main emphasis was placed on preventing misuse of taught skillsets"
"At a high level, such ethical issues were discussed by Jamil_and_Khan_(2011_CITE) and Smith_et al._(2002_CITE), with the latter highlighting the ethical dilemma created by a community which releases security assessment tools, and then also protects clients against individuals that use them"
A similar theme can be found in Matwyshyn_et al._(2010_CITE) who explored the ethics of security vulnerability research
The first was produced by Pierce_et al._(2006_CITE) who established a conceptual model for ethics within penetration testing which contains five ethical themes of which integrity is at the core
The second was by Ashraf_and_Habaebi_(2013_CITE) who reviewed penetration testing ethics within the context of the Islamic faith
The third was by Mouton_et al._(2015_CITE) who examined the requirement for ethics specifically within the context of social engineering
"Finn_and_Jakobsson_(2007_CITE) present three experiments to measure susceptibility to phishing attacks, discussing how to make them realistic, and ethical"
"Although not specific to penetration testing, Reece_and_Stahl_(2015_CITE) have also conducted a UK-based stakeholder-led study to examine perceptions around the professionalisation of information security, which found mixed levels of support."
"Cyber Essentials ( Department_for_Business_Innovation_and_Skills,_2014_CITE) is an entry-level organisational standard that provides basic assurance that an organisation is meeting minimum cyber security control requirements"
"PCI DSS (The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) ( PCI_Security_Standards_Council,_2016_CITE) enforces a business requirement for the information security of organisations handling payment transactions, including those by credit and debit card"
"ISO/IEC 15408 more commonly known as the Common Criteria outlines the requirements for the secure functionality of IT products and for assurance measures applied to these IT products during a security evaluation ( British_Standards_Institution,_2014_CITE)"
"The Cyber Essentials scheme ( Department_for_Business_Innovation_and_Skills,_2014_CITE) was introduced in Section 4.1, along with its two types of certification: Basic and Plus"
"CREST mandates that external vulnerability assessments must be conducted, on top of the core requirements of the scheme (ie, a self-assessment form), in order to ensure border controls are properly implemented ( CREST,_2014_CITE)."
"All accreditation bodies deliver assessments that meet the criteria set forth by the Common Test Specification ( CESG,_2014_CITE) which outlines the mandatory internal and external assessments, along with success criteria"
"To facilitate this process PCI DSS has released supplementary penetration testing guidance ( PCI_Security_Standards_Council,_2015_CITE), which includes recommended provider competencies (eg qualifications), methodologies (notably including emphasis on the importance of exploitation), and reporting"
"Some are generically focused including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-115 ( Scarfone et al, 2008) (which is considered best practice in PCI DSS; PCI_Security_Standards_Council,_2016_CITE) and the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) ( Herzog,_2010_CITE)"
"For example, the United States Department of Homeland Security has produced high-level guidelines on the use and challenges of penetration tests for assessing Industrial Control System (ICS) security ( U.S._Department_of_Homeland_Security,_2011_CITE)"
"A more thorough methodology is presented by the National Electric Sector Cybersecurity Organization Resource (NESCOR) ( Searle,_2012_CITE) which addresses penetration tests for assessing electric utilities in particular"
"An extension of this can be seen in the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (ie, a sub-system within the smart grid) Attack Methodology ( InGuardians,_2009_CITE)"
"There is much evidence to suggest that a shift towards a UK-style professionalisation is not only possible, but desired, as can be seen through the recommendation of UK originating schemes in non-UK and international standards (eg, PCI DSS; PCI_Security_Standards_Council,_2015_CITE), and as is evidenced by the expansion of UK originating schemes to other countries (eg, CREST Australia)."
A study showed that a significant portion of computers worldwide is infected with malware conducting clandestine activities ( Panda_Security_Report_CITE)
"The initial infection vector of most malware is usually through exploiting vulnerabilities of common networked software, eg, heap overflow vulnerability in a web browser or its plug-ins ( Cova_et al.,_2010_CITE)"
"For example, BINDER ( Cui_et al.,_2005_CITE) detects anomalous network activities on personal computers through analyzing the correlation in network events by the temporal and process information"
"BotMiner ( Gu_et al.,_2008_CITE) performs a correlation analysis across multiple hosts of a network for detecting similarly infected bots"
King_et al._(2005_CITE) constructed directed graphs from logs to show network connections for dissecting attack sequences
"Existing dependence analysis work (eg Natarajan_et al.,_2012;_Zand_et al._CITE) focuses on the network services and is not designed for malware detection"
"For example, NSDMiner ( Natarajan_et al.,_2012_CITE) addressed the problem of network service dependency for automatic manageability and network stability"
Rippler ( Zand_et al._CITE) is proposed to actively perturb or delay traffic to understand the dependencies between service and devices
"DNS tunneling has been abused by botnets for command and control communications ( Xu_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"Our rules are derived based on the patterns of user interactions and the attributes of HTTP requests from the browser including their system properties ( Zhang_et al.,_2012_CITE)."
"A specific root-trigger security policy is based on the user intention ( Zhang_et al.,_2012_CITE), where a valid root trigger should be related to a user activity (eg, a function call to retrieve user inputs, mouse clicks, or keyboard inputs)"
"For example, we can log the application information by a browser extension (eg, Tlogger_CITE)"
"Our evaluation is mainly focused on the network traffic via HTTP and DNS protocols, which are commonly used communication protocol both by legitimate users and attackers, and most firewalls allow them ( Xu_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"This malware runs as a stand-alone process, similar to the Pony bot ( Pony_botnet_CITE)"
"Botnet command and control channel using DNS tunneling ( DNScat_CITE) is extremely stealthy and difficult to detect ( Xu_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"ReSurf ( Xie_et al.,_2013_CITE), as the closest related work, aims at reconstructing web surfing activities from traffic traces via an analysis of request headers"
"BINDER ( Cui_et al.,_2005_CITE) detects break-ins on personal computers through analyzing the dependency of network events based on temporal and process information"
"ClickMiner ( Neasbitt_et al.,_2014_CITE) is proposed to reconstruct user browser interactions from network traces by actively replaying the recorded HTTP traffic within an instrumented browser"
"Not-A-Bot ( Gummadi_et al.,_2009_CITE) is a system for authenticating traffic-generating user inputs such as mouse clicks on hyperlinks"
"Previous studies proposed tools (eg, WebTap ( Borders_and_Prakash,_2004_CITE), WebShield ( Li_et al.,_2010_CITE), SpyProxy ( Moshchuk_et al.,_2007_CITE)) to ensure the web security and detect HTTP-based malware"
"WebTap ( Borders_and_Prakash,_2004_CITE) is a tool to identify anomalies by identifying changes and deviations in aggregated flows patterns in terms of usages with statistical metrics"
"Other host-based anomaly detection solutions ( Babi _et al.,_2011;_Kolbitsch_et al.,_2009_CITE) focus on learning and generalizing from observed malware behaviors, for example, Babic et al"
"analyzed the malware behavior using tree automata inference in ( Babi _et al.,_2011_CITE), Kolbitsch et al"
"built a behavior graph to tackle the malware's obfuscation and polymorphic in ( Kolbitsch_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Machine learning approaches have been widely adopted in the security literature, since the work by Lee_et al._(1999_CITE)"
"Using learning-based approaches to classifying the network traffic and detecting threats has been reported in Bilge_et al._(2011_CITE), Erman_et al._(2007_CITE), Moore_and_Zuev_(2005_CITE), Nguyen_and_Armitage_(2008_CITE), Williams_et al._(2006_CITE), Xie_et al._(2010_CITE), and Zomlot_et al._(2013_CITE)"
"Our triggering relation discovery problem may bear superficial similarities to the link prediction problem in the context of mining social network data ( Backstrom_and_Leskovec,_2011;_Getoor_and_Diehl,_2005;_Kahanda_and_Neville,_2009;_Liben-Nowell_and_Kleinberg,_2007_CITE)"
Getoor_and_Diehl_(2005_CITE) surveyed the link mining problem and pointed out the sparsity in linked data
Liben-Nowell_and_Kleinberg_(2007_CITE) formalized the link prediction problem and surveyed an array of methods on measuring the proximity of nodes in a network
"These advanced methods include logistic regression, decision tree, and naive Bayesian ( Kahanda_and_Neville,_2009_CITE) as well as supervised random walks ( Backstrom_and_Leskovec,_2011_CITE)"
"However, for the cases where a fuzzy rule base contains gaps (termed: sparse rule base [2]_CITE), if a given observation has no overlap with the antecedent values of any rule, conventional fuzzy inference methods cannot derive a conclusion"
"One particular issue is that the convexity of the derived fuzzy values is not guaranteed [5,6]_CITE, but convexity is often a crucial requirement for fuzzy inference in order to attain improved interpretability of the results"
"A number of significant extensions to the original FRI methods have been proposed in literature in an attempt to address this issue, including [7 13]_CITE"
"In particular, the scale and move transformation-based FRI approach (abbreviated to T-FRI hereafter) [14,15]_CITE and its generalisation [16,17]_CITE can handle interpolation and extrapolation which involve multiple fuzzy rules, where each rule consists of multiple antecedents"
This approach has recently been further enhanced with an adaptive mechanism such that appropriate chaining of fuzzy interpolative inferences can be performed [18]_CITE
"Further development has also been reported that allows the fuzzy rule interpolation and extrapolation to be performed in a backward manner, ie, from rule consequence to antecedent variables [19]_CITE."
The aforementioned FRI techniques provide a basic means for dealing with and interpreting uncertainty in rule-based reasoning by exploiting the expressive power of fuzzy sets [20]_CITE
This is because these approaches are implemented using conventional fuzzy set theory as a basis for the underlying representations [21]_CITE
"More generally, there may be different types of uncertainty in fuzzy rule-based systems that need to be captured or modelled [22]_CITE: (1) The linguistic variables that are used in the antecedents and consequences of the given rules may be indiscernible"
The concept of rough sets [23]_CITE was originally proposed as a mathematical tool to deal with incomplete or imperfect data and knowledge in information systems
"A rough set is itself an approximation of a vague concept by a pair of precise sets, called lower and upper approximations [24,25]_CITE"
"This differs from the concept of conventional rough sets, which is characterised by the lower and upper approximations whose elements are of full memberships [23]_CITE"
"With any P A there is a crisp equivalence relation IND( P) [23]_CITE: (1)IND(P)={(x,y) U2| a P,a(x)=a(y)}"
"Let X U, X be approximated using only the information contained within P by constructing the P- lower and P- upper approximations of X [23]_CITE: (2)P X={x|[x]P X}P X={x|[x]P X"
"The tuple P X,P X is called a rough-fuzzy (RF) set (which differs from the alternative use of this term in the literature [26]_CITE due to the parallel development of these related but different concepts)."
An important concept to introduce is the less than relation between two fuzzy sets [3]_CITE
"Note that in the above definition, two rules (eg, the R 1 and R 2 given previously) are said to flank a given observation [3]_CITE, say, O=(A 1*,A 2*, ,A M*), if A 1j A j* A 2j, or A 2j A j* A 1j, j {1, ,M}."
"In order to support the interpolation of rules involving RF sets following the transformation-based approach [14]_CITE, the rules which have minimal distances from a given observation need to be selected first"
"Note that in the existing T-FRI [15]_CITE, the Rep( A) of an ordinary fuzzy set A is defined by the weighted average of the x coordinate values of all odd points ai, i {0, ,k 1}, such that: (8)Rep(A)= i=0k 1wiaiwith A=(a0, ,ak 1) being a polygonal fuzzy set of k odd points, and wi denoting the weight assigned to the point ai"
Other alternative definitions can be found in [15]_CITE
"One particular application in this area has recently been investigated in [17,18]_CITE, which is based on the study of [30]_CITE"
The original problem of [18]_CITE is simplified such that all of the factors under consideration are linearly connected
"Table 7 shows the results of the averaged root-mean-square error (RMSE) values computed over 10 times 10-fold cross-validation [35,36]_CITE, in relation to K ( K=2, ,7) partitions (ie, the underlying domain of each variable is divided into 6 fuzzy values) and N ( N=6) closest rules that are used to interpolate the conclusions"
Ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators [37 39]_CITE may be applied to enhance the ability of this approach
It would be interesting to investigate the performance of the approach by learning the weights from the constructed rule bases [40]_CITE
"For example, there are axiomatizations of Physics that do not rely on the rather natural concepts of space and time [18]_CITE"
The second and third drawbacks mentioned above have been the main reasons for criticism on the whole enterprise of formalizing science [20]_CITE
"As a response to the criticism, there was a rise of semantic approaches, which adopted a more model-theoretic approach to the formalization of science [20]_CITE"
"The main goal of this paper is to advocate in favor of a more prominent role for proofs in the formalization of Physics, and consequently, for proof theory in approaches to Hilbert sixth problem [22]_CITE and in studies of the foundations of Physics"
The formal proofs in this paper are written in an extension of Gentzen sequent calculus LK [11]_CITE
"Traditionally, works of axiomatization have formalized physical laws as axioms that are supposed to be used as assumptions in proofs [20]_CITE"
"Although the general problem of finding the shortest proofs by means of cut-introduction is undecidable [5]_CITE, there are a few preliminary algorithms that introduce simple cuts [10,15,24]_CITE, and it has been shown that some techniques of machine learning, such as decision tree learning, can be seen as cut-introduction techniques from a proof-theoretical point of view [23]_CITE"
"The problem of eliminating cuts from proofs is much easier than the problem of introducing cuts and has been much more deeply investigated [11,4]_CITE"
"This is advantageous in certain cases, for in a cut-free proof it is easy, via Gentzen Midsequent Theorem [11]_CITE or more general Herbrand sequent extraction algorithms [16]_CITE, to extract a Herbrand disjunction [12]_CITE that contains instances of the quantified variables of the problem"
The Curry-Howard isomorphism [8]_CITE states that there is a correspondence between proofs of the implicational fragment of intuitionistic logic and lambda terms
"Another philosophical viewpoint that opposes axiomatization is that of Welt-anschauungen analyses, according to which science ought to be viewed as an ongoing social enterprise [and] epistemic understanding of scientific theories could only be had by seeing the dynamics of theory development [20]_CITE"
It must take pragmatics into account and it must explicitly consider how the producers and consumers of a theory use and change it [21]_CITE
"Diagrams in [7]_CITE suggest that theories/programs should correspond to axioms, and the execution of the program by a computer, regarded as an automated theorem prover, should output empirical data in the form of theorems"
"Future work should concentrate on applying these proof-theoretical ideas to complement the formalization of more interesting physical theories, such as Relativity (eg [2]_CITE) and Quantum Mechanics (eg [1]_CITE); on improving proof assistants and proof-theoretical techniques, such as cut-elimination and cut-introduction, in order to support logical calculi at least as sophisticated as LK P; and on investigating the new links between Physics and Computation that are opened by proof theory."
"DSPLs produce software capable of adapting to changes, by means of binding the variation points at runtime [1]_CITE"
"In our approach, we model variability at the architectural level using the Common Variability Language [7]_CITE (CVL)"
"Existing approaches [3,9 14]_CITE mainly consist of analysing, at design time, the contextual changes and the generation of the reconfiguration plans to fit the new environmental conditions"
"Both services are designed to be integrated in a middleware for adaptive applications development [21]_CITE, although in this paper we focus on presenting the details of how the DRS accomplishes the runtime reconfiguration of mobile applications"
"Therefore, in DSPLs the system architecture supports all possible adaptations defined by the set of dynamic variation points [1]_CITE."
"In this context, most DSPL approaches share some common properties with the Autonomic Computing paradigm [2]_CITE (AC) such as the monitoring of the environment and the generation of successive configurations."
"As stated by Guo et al [23]_CITE, applying GAs can be highly appropriate when the solutions space is very wide and it is not affordable to evaluate all of them due to a lack of resources and time."
"So, at run-time we generate the successive software architecture configurations by binding the architectural variation points specified in a variability language [25]_CITE"
"Regarding the variability language used, we propose to use CVL as it eases the generation of the architectural variation points compared with, for instance, feature models [25]_CITE"
"Note, that an exact algorithm cannot be used because the problem to be solved has been proven to be NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time hard) [26]_CITE."
"Most DSPL approaches generate, at design time, the configurations that will be deployed at runtime [13,27 29]_CITE"
"As Brataas et al show in [30]_CITE, the reconfiguration time is divided into three different tasks: (1) analyse the context data; (2) plan (decide) the new configuration and (3) execute the plan in order to deploy the new configuration"
"However, this is an NP-hard problem [26]_CITE and, therefore, it is impossible to use exact techniques to solve this optimization problem for our purpose"
Safe adaptation is typically addressed by ensuring the property of quiescence [31]_CITE
According to Kramer et al [31]_CITE the components of the software architecture can be in one of the following states: 1.Active
"Typically, the transitions from each one of these states is described using a state machine [31,32]_CITE, as shown in Fig_7 ."
A weaker condition than the quiescence property is the tranquillity [33]_CITE property
"In particular, Gamez et al [3]_CITE propose a reconfiguration mechanism, also driven by the MAPE-K loop, that switches between different architectural configurations at runtime"
"The variability of the system is specified using FMs, and both models (PervML and FMs) are related using a realization model, which is an extension that they have incorporated in Atlas Model Weaving (AMW) [36]_CITE, an Eclipse plugin for model weaving"
"The most similar approach to ours is the work presented in [19]_CITE, where an optimization algorithm is also used to improve user interface adaptation at runtime"
This sphere phantom nearly approximates the human body [1]_CITE
"The lesser elements and trace elements constitute 4% of the body's mass [2,3]_CITE"
"In the elastic reaction, the total kinetic energy of the incoming particle is conserved whereas, in the inelastic collision, the nucleus absorbs some neutron's energy and it is left in an excited state [4]_CITE"
It varies from infinity for atoms of hydrogen to about 6 MeV for atom of oxygen to 1 MeV for uranium [5]_CITE
"However, the neutron inelastic cross section decreases rapidly with decreasing energy when energy is less than 25 MeV [4]_CITE."
"It is estimated by the primary neutron flux, and by neglecting the scattered neutrons after this primary interaction [5]_CITE."
241Am Be has been considered as a neutron source because it has been used as a calibrating source for most of the neutron surveying instruments [5]_CITE
"In addition, the ambient dose equivalent rates produced by an 241Am Be neutron source at various source-to-detector distances have been studied in literature [6 8]_CITE."
"In the first approach, the dose rates were calculated using, the neutron cross-section, and elemental composition of human body tissue and the radiation-weighting factor of neutrons have been used from ICRP 103 [9]_CITE"
"The neutron emission of the source is 2.2 10 6 n 1 Ci 1, with tolerance of around 10%, and strength of 1.1 10 7 n 1 [10]_CITE"
Typical percentage compositions are C (0.004%); Mn (1.59%); P (0.011%); S (0.008%); Si (0.37%); Cr (16.96%); Ni (13.61%); Mo (2.29%); and Fe (65.157%) [10]_CITE
"The 241Am Be neutron source produce neutrons of wide spectrum with energies ranging from 0 eV up to 11 MeV [8,11]_CITE, and an average energy around 4.5 MeV [5,10,12,13]_CITE."
"For fast neutrons, in case of the first collision, the mean absorbed dose rate in Gy/s, from neutrons whose average energies, E n, can be calculated by [5]_CITE (1)D= En iNi ifi1JKg/Gy"
"Since W R is dimensionless, the sum is performed over all types of radiations involved [1]_CITE for irradiating by neutrons and Eq (4) becomes; (5)HT=WRDR"
"Where, W R is the radiation weighting factor for neutrons which is given in [9]_CITE (6)WR=5.0+17.0e (Ln(2En))26,for1MeV En 50MeV"
"For any type of radiation, the effective dose, E, can be calculated as in [1]_CITE by following equation: (7)E= TWT RWRDR,T"
The sum is performed over all organs and tissues of the human body [1]_CITE
"For neutron, whose mean energy equals to 4.5 MeV, the ratio between the effective dose and ambient dose equivalent in case of antero-posterior geometry, AP, approximately equals to 1.2 [1]_CITE"
"An antero-posterior, AP, geometry irradiation has been selected as an appropriate geometry irradiation to calculate the ambient dose equivalent rate as used to calculate the personal dose equivalent rate by Domingo et al [16]_CITE."
"The ambient dose equivalent can be calculated using the conversion coefficients for radiological protection quantities for external radiation exposures [1]_CITE, from the effective dose rate, that can be calculated by: (8)E =e"
"The total fluence, (s 1 cm 2), from cylindrical source can be calculated at point, p, as in Fig_2 by Eq (9) when the self-absorption of source and the attenuation coefficient of media (air) are neglected [17]_CITE"
"From the geometry of Fig_3 , F( 1) equals to F( 2) and can be given by Eq (10) where is measured in degrees with 1% statistical uncertainty [17]_CITE (10)F( )=0.016 +0.005"
"Table 1 shows the elastic scattering cross- section, i , from the [18]_CITE, the atomic masses [19]_CITE, the percentage of the elemental composition in human body [2,3]_CITE, and the mean fraction energy f i, for the elemental composition of human body (tissue)"
This curve has been plotted from the data of table of the effective dose per fluence for mono-energetic neutrons in the CD accompanying with ICRP 116 report [1]_CITE
"From Fig_4, it can be seen that the ambient dose equivalent rate *(10) is inversely proportional to r 2 (source center-to-reference point distance perpendicular to the source axis), which is consistent with the data reported by Mazrou et al [6]_CITE"
"This is attributed to the role of scattering by molecules of different gases that compose the air [7,20]_CITE"
"Accordingly, the mean energy will be minimized where the effective dose of neutrons increases as the energy of neutron decreases in the range of 1 MeV up to 100 MeV [1]_CITE."

"Thus, the pattern classification problem is often cast as the task of finding a classifier that minimizes the misclassification rate [1]_CITE"
"In this case, the posterior class probabilities p( j| x) for a given pattern x is computed; then pattern x is assigned to the class, for which the p( j| x) value is maximum [1 6]_CITE"
"(In the last step it is being assumed that all misclassification errors are equally bad [1,3,4]_CITE.)"
Estimating p( x| j) from D is not straightforward [1 5]_CITE
"In this paper we are concerned with one particular approach that is widely thought to be apropos to the task of estimating p( x| j) from a representative training dataset: the so-called Parzen Window method [1,2,4,9,10]_CITE, also known as Parzen estimator, Potential function technique [10]_CITE, to name but a few."
Another approach albeit a particular case of the scheme above is that proposed by Specht [13]_CITE
"It was based on a Taylor series expansion of ( x, x i; ) (see Eq 8), such that an rth order polynomial in L variables was required to estimate and store (L+rL) terms to approximate p^(x| j) [10,13,14]_CITE"
"Some effective methods to construct exact solutions of NPDEs have been put forward, such as the inverse scattering method, Hirota method, B cklund transformation, homogeneous balance method and so on [3 6]_CITE"
"Lie group theory was widely used in many branches of mathematics and physics, it has been developed in differential equations since Bluman and Col proposed similarity theory for differential equations in 1970s [7]_CITE"
"The main idea of Lie group method is to use the invariance condition of given NPDEs to get similarity variable and reduction equations, and then to obtain solitary wave solutions or similarity solutions of given NPDEs by solving the reduction equations [7 14]_CITE"
"One can naturally extend them to matrices and vectors leading to the max min (fuzzy) linear algebra of [2,4,12,13,15]_CITE"
"In the max min literature, subsemimodules arise as images of max min matrices [14]_CITE or as eigenspaces"
"This development has led to many theoretical and algorithmic results, and in particular, to new methods describing the solution set of max plus linear systems of equations [1,16]_CITE."
"Zimmermann [29]_CITE also suggested to develop the convex geometry over wider classes of semirings with idempotent addition, including the max min semiring"
"Some recent developments in max min convexity include the description of max min segments [22,26]_CITE, max min semispaces [23]_CITE and hyperplanes [17]_CITE, separation and non-separation results [18,19]_CITE"
"For example, in [8]_CITE Dubois and Prade developed an axiomatic approach to quantitative utility theory"
"The utility function introduced there relies on the notion of possibilistic mixture, where the possibilistic mixture (which under some natural conditions is also a possibilistic measure [10]_CITE) of the possibilistic measures 1, 2 with possibilities , ,max ( , )=1, is defined as max (min ( , 1),min ( , 2)), that is, as a point on the max min segment [ 1, 2]"
"This is a particular case of extended mixtures of decomposable measures (which are a family of set functions encompassing probability measures and necessity and possibility measures as particular cases), as studied in [9]_CITE where the application to utility theory is pointed out."
"Thus it is closely related to the unique solvability of max min linear systems of the type A x=b and, further, to the trapezoidal property of a matrix as studied, for example, in [2,4,12,14]_CITE."
"The dimension of a max min convex set can be introduced in the spirit of the tropical rank, see for instance Develin, Santos and Sturmfels [7,_Section_4]_CITE"
"This concept is a max min analogue of the so-called polytropes, ie, the sets which are (traditionally) convex and tropically convex at the same time, see Joswig and Kulas [11]_CITE"
"For a monograph in conventional convexity see, eg, Rockafellar [25]_CITE."
"As K is closed, by the usual Minkowski theorem [25,_Corollary_18.5.1]_CITE it can be represented as the set of positive linear combinations of its extremal rays (recall that w K is called extremal if u+v=w and u,v K imply that u and v are proportional with w), which generate the whole Lin(C y)"
"In the remaining part of the paper, following the parallel with the tropical rank considered by Develin, Santos and Sturmfels [7]_CITE in the max plus algebra, we investigate how our notion of dimension relates with the notion of strong regularity in max min algebra"
"In this section we establish a close relation between our notion of strong regularity and the one usually studied in max min algebra [2 4,12,14]_CITE"
"Furthermore, it is plausible that the results of this paper might be generalizable to the setting of [15]_CITE, and also to the L-convexities and biconvexities of [24]_CITE."
"The ability to integrate multisensory information is a fundamental feature of the brain that provides a robust perceptual experience for an efficient interaction with the environment ( Ernst_&_Bulthoff,_2004;_Stein_&_Meredith,_1993;_Stein,_Stanford,_&_Rowland,_2009_CITE)"
"Similarly, computational models for multimodal integration are a paramount ingredient of autonomous robots to forming robust and meaningful representations of perceived events (see Ursino,_Cuppini,_&_Magosso_(2014)_CITE for a recent review)"
"Multimodal representations have been shown to improve robustness in the context of action recognition and action-driven perception, human-robot interaction, and sensory-driven motor behavior ( Bauer,_Magg,_&_Wermter,_2015;_Kachouie,_Sedighadeli,_Khosla,_&_Chu,_2014;_Noda,_Arie,_Suga,_&_Ogata,_2014_CITE)"
"Since real-world events unfold at multiple spatial and temporal scales, artificial neurocognitive architectures should account for the efficient processing and integration of spatiotemporal stimuli with different levels of complexity ( Fonlupt,_2003;_Hasson,_Yang,_Vallines,_Heeger,_&_Rubin,_2008;_Lerner,_Honey,_Silbert,_&_Hasson,_2011;_Taylor,_Hobbs,_Burroni,_&_Siegelmann,_2015_CITE)"
"For instance, Vavre ka_and_Farka _(2014)_CITE presented a connectionist architecture that learns to bind visual properties of objects (spatial location, shape and color) to proper lexical features"
"Similarly, Morse,_Benitez,_Belpaeme,_Cangelosi,_and_Smith_(2015)_CITE investigated how infants may map a name to an object and how body posture may affect these mappings"
"The development of associations between co-occurring stimuli for multimodal binding has been strongly supported by neurophysiological evidence ( Fiebelkorn,_Foxe,_&_Molholm,_2009_CITE)."
"In fact, action words do not label actions in the same way that nouns label objects ( Gentner,_1982_CITE)"
"The human cortex comprises a hierarchy of spatiotemporal receptive fields for features with increasing complexity of representation ( Hasson_et_al.,_2008;_Lerner_et_al.,_2011;_Taylor_et_al.,_2015_CITE), ie higher-level areas process information accumulated over larger spatiotemporal receptive windows"
"Words for actions and events appear to be among children earliest vocabulary ( Bloom,_1993_CITE)"
"During their development, children have a wide range of perceptual, social, and linguistic cues at their disposal that they can use to attach a novel label to a novel referent ( Hirsch-Pasek,_Golinkoff,_&_Hollich,_2000,_chapter_6_CITE)"
"Recent experiments have shown that human infants are able to learn action word mappings using cross-situational statistics, thus in the presence of sometimes unavailable ground-truth action words ( Smith_&_Yu,_2008_CITE)"
"This hypothesis is supported by neurophysiological studies evidencing strong links between the cortical areas governing visual and language processing, and suggesting high levels of functional interaction of these areas for the formation of multimodal representations of audiovisual stimuli ( Belin,_Zatorre,_Lafaille,_Ahad,_&_Pike,_2000;_Foxe_et_al.,_2000;_Belin,_Zatorre,_&_Ahad,_2002;_Pulverm ller,_2005;_Raij,_Uutela,_&_Hari,_2000_CITE)."
"From a neurobiological perspective, neurons selective to actions in terms of time-varying patterns of body pose and motion features have been found in a wide number of brain structures, such as the superior temporal sulcus (STS), the parietal, the premotor and the motor cortex ( Giese_&_Rizzolatti,_2015_CITE)"
"In particular, it has been argued that the STS in the mammalian brain may be the basis of an action-encoding network with neurons driven by the perception of dynamic human bodies ( Vangeneugden,_Pollick,_&_Vogels,_2009_CITE), and that for this purpose it receives converging inputs from earlier visual areas from both the ventral and dorsal pathways ( Beauchamp,_2005;_Garcia_&_Grossman,_2008;_Thirkettle,_Benton,_&_Scott-Samuel,_2009_CITE)"
"Furthermore, neuroimaging studies have shown that the posterior STS shows a greater response for audiovisual stimuli than to unimodal visual or auditory stimuli ( Beauchamp,_Lee,_Argall,_&_Martin,_2004;_Calvert,_2001;_Senkowski,_Saint-Amour,_Hfle,_&_Foxe,_2011;_Wright,_Pelphrey,_Allison,_Mckeown,_&_Mccarthy,_2003_CITE)"
"Thus, the STS area is thought to be an associative learning device for linking different unimodal representations and accounting for the mapping of naturally occurring, highly correlated features such as body pose and motion, the characteristic sound of an action ( Barraclough,_Xiao,_Baker,_Oram,_&_Perrett,_2005;_Beauchamp_et_al.,_2004_CITE) and linguistic stimuli ( Belin_et_al.,_2002;_Stevenson_&_James,_2009;_Wright_et_al.,_2003_CITE)"
"These findings together suggest that multimodal representations of actions in the brain play an important role for a robust perception of complex action patterns, with the STS representing a multisensory area in the brain network for social cognition ( Adolphs,_2003;_Allison,_Puce,_&_McCarthy,_2000;_Beauchamp,_2005;_Beauchamp,_Yasar,_Frye,_&_Ro,_2008_CITE)."
"For this purpose, we extended our recently proposed spatiotemporal hierarchy for the integration of pose-motion action cues ( Parisi_et_al.,_2015_CITE) to include an associative network layer where action word mappings develop from co-occurring audiovisual inputs using asymmetric inter-layer connectivity"
"Each network layer comprises a self-organizing neural network that employs neurobiologically-motivated Hebbian-like plasticity and habituation for stable incremental learning ( Marsland,_Shapiro,_&_Nehmzow,_2002_CITE)"
"Network layers 1 and 2 comprise a two-stream hierarchy for the processing and subsequent integration of body pose and motion features, resembling the ventral and the dorsal pathway respectively for the processing of complex motion patterns ( Giese_&_Poggio,_2003_CITE)"
"The integration of pose and motion cues is carried out in network layer 3 (or G STS) to provide movement dynamics in the joint feature space ( Parisi_et_al.,_2015_CITE)"
"Hierarchical learning from contiguous Growing When Required (GWR) networks ( Marsland_et_al.,_2002_CITE) shapes a functional hierarchy that processes spatiotemporal visual patterns with an increasing level of complexity by using neural activation trajectories from lower-level layers for training higher-level layers"
"Experience-driven development plays a crucial role in the brain ( Nelson,_2000_CITE), with topographic maps being a common feature of the cortex for processing sensory inputs ( Willshaw_&_von_der_Malsburg,_1976_CITE)"
"Different models of neural self-organization have been proposed to resemble the dynamics of basic biological findings on Hebbian-like learning and map plasticity (eg, Fritzke,_1995;_Kohonen,_1988_CITE)."
"Our learning model consists of hierarchically-arranged GWR networks ( Marsland_et_al.,_2002_CITE) that obtain progressively generalized representations of sensory inputs and learn inherent spatiotemporal dependencies"
"During the training, the network dynamically changes its topological structure to better match the input space following competitive Hebbian learning ( Martinetz,_1993_CITE)"
"Different from other incremental models of self-organization that create new neurons at a fixed growth rate (eg Fritzke,_1995,_1997_CITE), GWR-based learning creates new nodes whenever the activity of trained neurons is smaller than a given threshold"
"For this purpose, the network implements a firing counter [0,1] to express how frequently a neuron has fired based on a simplified model of how the efficacy of an habituating synapse reduces over time ( Stanley,_1976_CITE)"
"After the training is completed, neurons in G STSm encode sequence-selective prototype action segments, following the assumption that the recognition of actions must be selective for temporal order ( Giese_&_Poggio,_2003;_Hasson_et_al.,_2008_CITE)."
"The goal of our experiment was to compare the classification performance of the proposed OSS-GWR with respect to the traditional GWR extended for classification (S-GWR, Parisi_et_al.,_2015_CITE) using a decreasing percentage of available labeled samples in the training set"
"The overall approach is said to be online since the algorithm incrementally propagates labels during the training process ( Beyer_&_Cimiano,_2011_CITE), in contrast to offline methods where labels are used after the unsupervised training of a network has finished."
"Sequence selectivity driven by asymmetric connections has been argued to be a feature of the cortex for neurons encoding optic flow patterns, where an active neuron preactives neurons encoding future patterns, while it inhibits neurons encoding other patterns ( Mineiro_&_Zipser,_1998_CITE)"
"This centroid was chosen based on the motivation that the orientation of the torso is the most characteristic reference during the execution of a full-body action ( Papadopoulos,_Axenopoulos,_&_Daras,_2014_CITE)."
"For recording action labels, we used automatic speech recognition from Google cloud-based ASR enhanced with domain-dependent post-processing ( Twiefel,_Baumann,_Heinrich,_&_Wermter,_2014_CITE)"
"A vast corpus of studies has shown the ability of the brain to integrate multimodal information for providing a coherent perceptual experience ( Ernst_&_Bulthoff,_2004;_Stein_&_Meredith,_1993;_Stein_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"In particular for the integration of audiovisual stimuli, neurophysiological studies have evidenced strong links between the areas in the brain governing visual and language processing for the formation of multimodal perceptual representations ( Belin_et_al.,_2000;_Belin_et_al.,_2002;_Foxe_et_al.,_2000;_Pulverm ller,_2005;_Raij_et_al.,_2000_CITE)"
"However, the question of how to develop artificial models that efficiently process and bind multimodal information has remained an issue to be investigated ( Ursino_et_al.,_2014_CITE)."
"For example, in the STS, which is thought to be an associative learning device for linking different unimodal perceptual representations, and consequently crucial for social cognition ( Allison_et_al.,_2000;_Adolphs,_2003;_Beauchamp,_2005;_Beauchamp_et_al.,_2008_CITE)"
"It has been shown that different regions in the STS are activated by naturally occurring, highly correlated action features, such as pose, motion, the characteristic sound of an action ( Barraclough_et_al.,_2005;_Beauchamp_et_al.,_2004_CITE) and linguistic stimuli ( Belin_et_al.,_2002;_Stevenson_&_James,_2009;_Wright_et_al.,_2003_CITE)."
"The modeling of neurobiologically observed principles underlying audiovisual integration in the STS for speech and non-speech stimuli, such as superadditivity ( Calvert,_Campbell,_&_Brammer,_2000_CITE), spatial and temporal congruence ( Bushara,_Grafman,_&_Hallett,_2001;_Macaluso,_George,_Dolan,_Spence,_&_Driver,_2004_CITE), and inverse effectiveness ( Stevenson_&_James,_2009_CITE), was out of the scope of this paper and will be subject of future research."
"For instance, several neurophysiological studies have evidenced strong interaction between the visual and motor representations, more specifically including the STS, parietal cortex, and premotor cortex (see Giese_&_Rizzolatti_(2015)_CITE for a recent survey), with higher activation of neurons in the motor system for biomechanically-plausible, perceived motion sequences ( Miller_&_Saygin,_2013_CITE)"
"However, while our architecture scales up to a larger number of modalities, it does not account for crossmodal learning aspects, eg in an embodied robot perception scenario where motor contingencies influence audiovisual mappings ( Morse_et_al.,_2015_CITE)"
"Motivated by the process of input-driven self-organization exhibited by topographic maps in the cortex ( Miikkulainen,_Bednar,_Choe,_&_Sirosh,_2005;_Nelson,_2000;_Willshaw_&_von_der_Malsburg,_1976_CITE), we proposed a learning model encompassing a hierarchy of Growing When Required (GWR) networks ( Marsland_et_al.,_2002_CITE)"
"GWR networks have the ability to dynamically change their topological structure through competitive Hebbian learning ( Martinetz,_1993_CITE) and incrementally match the distribution of the data in input space"
"While the process of neural growth of the GWR algorithm does not resemble biologically plausible mechanisms of neurogenesis (eg, Eriksson_et_al.,_1998;_Gould,_2007;_Ming_&_Song,_2011_CITE), it is an efficient learning model exhibiting a computationally convenient trade-off between adaptation to dynamic input and learning convergence"
"For instance, it has been shown that GWR learning is particularly suitable for novelty detection and cumulative learning in robot scenarios ( Marsland,_Nehmzow,_&_Shapiro,_2005_CITE)."
"Our GWR-based hierarchical learning architecture allows to obtain progressively specialized neurons encoding latent spatiotemporal dynamics of the input ( Parisi_et_al.,_2015_CITE)"
"This hierarchical organization is consistent with neurophysiological evidence for increasingly large spatiotemporal receptive windows in the human cortex ( Hasson_et_al.,_2008;_Lerner_et_al.,_2011;_Taylor_et_al.,_2015_CITE), where simple features manifest in low-level layers closest to sensory inputs, while increasingly complex representations emerge in deeper layers"
"Specifically for the visual cortex, Hasson_et_al._(2008)_CITE showed that while early visual areas such as the primary visual cortex (V1) and the motion-sensitive area (MT+) yield higher responses to instantaneous sensory input, high-level areas such as the STS were more affected by information accumulated over longer timescales ( 12 s)"
"This kind of hierarchical aggregation is a fundamental organizational principle of cortical networks for dealing with perceptual and cognitive processes that unfold over time ( Fonlupt,_2003_CITE)."
"On the other hand, several developmental studies have shown that human infants are able to learn action word mappings also in the presence of missing, ambiguous or sometimes contradictory referents using cross-situational statistics ( Smith_&_Yu,_2008_CITE)"
"It has been shown that lexical features can be learned using recursive self-organizing architectures ( Strickert_&_Hammer,_2005_CITE), obtaining action word representations from a phonemic representation of recognized audio"
"Such a processing scheme would be in line with neurophysiological evidence supporting the hierarchical processing of aural features in the auditory cortex with increasing temporal receptive windows ( Lerner_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Mutual exclusion is a fundamental process synchronization problem in concurrent systems [1]_CITE, and it has been studied extensively in the last half century"
"Such generalizations include k-mutual exclusion [4]_CITE, mutual inclusion [2]_CITE, and -mutual inclusion [3]_CITE"
"Recently, the relationship between k-mutual exclusion and -mutual inclusion is shown in [3]_CITE."
It is shown in [3]_CITE that k-mutual exclusion algorithm and (n k)-mutual inclusion algorithm are interchangeable by swapping in-critical-section state and out-of-critical-section state
"Mental rotation has been widely investigated not only in cognitive psychology, but also in cognitive neuroscience and computational modelling ( Kosslyn,_1996;_Zacks,_2008_CITE)"
"Initially, it was proposed that the brain mechanisms underlying mental rotation mainly involve visual and spatial perception systems ( Corballis_&_McLaren,_1982;_Shepard_&_Metzler,_1971_CITE)"
"More recently, behavioural ( Wexler_et al.,_1998;_Wohlschl ger,_2001_CITE) and neuroscientific experiments ( Georgopoulos,_Lurito,_Petrides,_Schwartz,_&_Massey,_1989;_Lamm_et al.,_2007_CITE) have suggested the idea that mental rotation relies on a mentally simulated action ( Michelon,_Vettel,_&_Zacks,_2006_CITE) rather than on a purely visual and spatial imagery skill"
"Brain-imaging evidence on the brain areas most involved in mental rotation supports the idea that mental rotation indeed depends on a strong integration of sensorimotor processes and covert mental simulation of motor movements (see Zacks,_2008_CITE, for a review)"
"In particular, based on refined experimental paradigms, mental rotation has been proposed to involve the following processes ( Lamm_et al.,_2007_CITE): (a) encoding of stimuli and the generation of mental images; (b) planning and execution of mental rotation; (c) comparison (matching) of the rotated stimulus with the target stimulus; (d) decision and performance of the same/different response"
"Most of these models tend to focus on the rotation of objects having different rotation axis and shapes to support object recognition, and have been developed using artificial neural network design ( Fukumi,_Omatu,_&_Nishikawa,_1997;_Fukumi,_Omatu,_Takeda,_&_Kosaka,_1992;_Inui_&_Ashizawa,_2011;_Kulkarni,_Yap,_&_Byars,_1990;_Rowley,_Baluja,_&_Kanade,_1998;_Sasama,_Mitsumoto,_Yoneda,_&_Tamura,_2009_CITE)"
"For example, Sasama_et al._(2009)_CITE proposed an error back-propagation neural network model that takes two images as input and produces one binary vector as an output that encodes the angular disparity between the two input images together with a response answer (match/mismatch)"
"Similarly, Inui_and_Ashizawa_(2011)_CITE proposed a radial basis function neural network to mentally rotate 3D objects"
"Indeed, endowing robots with mental rotation capabilities could increase their planning abilities in relation to the manipulation of objects, in particular, as planning in robots has mainly focused on navigation ( Baldassarre,_2001,_2003;_Dissanayake,_Newman,_Clark,_Durrant-Whyte,_&_Csorba,_2001;_Meyer_&_Filliat,_2003_CITE) and reaching tasks ( Khatib,_1986;_Masehian_&_Sedighizadeh,_2007_CITE) rather than on object manipulation"
"As further discussed in Section 4 (Conclusions), mental rotation seen as a form of planning has also some peculiarities related to the low number of actions involved, and to the fact that it involves spatial transformation processes that are invariant with respect to the object involved ( Terekhov_&_O Regan,_2013_CITE), which may suggest interesting solutions for planning problems with this type of features."
"We ( Seepanomwan,_Caligiore,_Baldassarre,_&_Cangelosi,_2013a,_2013b_CITE) recently proposed a neural-network model whose macro architecture was linked to brain macro areas"
"This model, a predecessor to the model proposed here, was developed within an embodied cognition theoretical framework for which high-level cognition processes rely on the same areas of the brain used to process analogous sensorimotor information ( Borghi_&_Cimatti,_2010_CITE)"
"According to this view, off-line cognition, such as mental rotation and imaging, is body based: even when decoupled from the environment, the activity of the mind is grounded in mechanisms that evolved for interaction with the environment that is, mechanisms of sensory processing and motor control ( Wilson,_2002_CITE)"
"The model departed from another model TRoPICALS developed within the computational embodied neuroscience framework and aiming to establish detailed links between embodied cognition and behaviour and the brain system-level mechanisms underlying them ( Caligiore,_Borghi,_Parisi,_&_Baldassarre,_2010_CITE; Caligiore,_Borghi_et al.,_2013_CITE; Caligiore,_Pezzulo,_Miall,_&_Baldassarre,_2013_CITE; TRoPICALS focused on compatibility effects, Tucker_&_Ellis,_2001_CITE, and affordance processing, Gibson,_1986_CITE; Rizzolatti_&_Craighero,_2004_CITE)"
"The model ( Seepanomwan_et al.,_2013a,_2013b_CITE) reproduces some mechanisms, possibly performed in the parietal premotor brain circuits, implementing the object mental rotation processes and some other mechanisms, possibly performed in prefrontal premotor circuits, implementing the decision making processes involved in mental rotation (see Zacks,_2008_CITE, and Section 1.1, for more details on the related biological mechanisms)"
"Third, it does not fully exploit the sensorimotor possibilities rendered by its robotic embodied nature, for example to investigate the interesting interference/synergy effects that current proprioception and gestures can have on mental rotation (eg, see Wexler_et al.,_1998_CITE; Wohlschl ger_&_Wohlschl ger,_1998_CITE)"
"In particular, the areas around the intraparietal sulcus (more specifically, the superior parietal lobule, Brodmann Area BA7, and the inferior parietal lobule, BA 40), and the areas surrounding the parieto-occipital sulcus (parieto-occipital arcus, BA 19) ( Carpenter,_Just,_Keller,_Eddy,_&_Thulborn,_1999_CITE; Harris_&_Miniussi,_2003_CITE; see Zacks,_2008_CITE, for a review)"
"Posterior parietal cortex receives input related to both visual and somatosensory information ( Rizzolatti,_Luppino,_&_Matelli,_1998_CITE), and on this basis it is capable of elaborating information about the location and orientation of target objects in peripersonal and extrapersonal space, and their relation to own body ( Andersen_&_Buneo,_2002_CITE; Colby_&_Goldberg,_1999_CITE), in large part employing eye-centred coordinate frames modulated by own body postures ( Snyder,_Grieve,_Brotchie,_&_Andersen,_1998_CITE)"
"Posterior-occipital cortex includes high-level visual areas encoding complex visual features, in particular related to movement (eg involving global and own movement, Braddick_et al.,_2001_CITE)"
"Based on this evidence, these areas are thought to play a key role in implementing the proprioceptive and visual information integration and transformation supporting the core processes of the dynamic mental rotation processes ( Zacks,_2008_CITE)."
"Other brain regions that consistently activate during the mental rotation experiment involve the supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex, in particular involving the medial precentral gyrus (BA6) ( Cohen_&_Bookheimer,_1994_CITE; Johnston,_Leek,_Atherton,_Thacker,_&_Jackson,_2004_CITE; Lamm_et al.,_2007_CITE; Zacks,_2008_CITE)"
"These areas encode a repertoire of actions at a more abstract level with respect to primary motor cortex, and play important functions in motor planning and execution ( Jeannerod,_Arbib,_Rizzolatti,_&_Sakata,_1995_CITE)"
"This possibility is corroborated by the fact that the supplementary motor area has been strongly involved in motor imagery ( Stephan_et al.,_1995_CITE)"
"Some studies also reveal an activation of primary motor areas, primarily linked to the production of the final response (button press) rather than to the main mental simulation processes ( Richter_et al.,_2000_CITE)."
"Kosslyn,_Digirolamo,_Thompson,_and_Alpert_(1998)_CITE and Zacks_(2008)_CITE have also shown the activation of prefrontal areas, in particular the inferior lateral prefrontal cortex (inferior precentral sulcus, BA44/45)"
"This region, part of Broca area responsible for speech production, is involved in motor production and action recognition ( Rizzolatti,_Fadiga,_Gallese,_&_Fogassi,_1996_CITE)"
"Given its high-level within the motor hierarchy, this area might orchestrate mental rotation at a high-level, as suggested by its role in motor imaging ( Grafton,_Arbib,_Fadiga,_&_Rizzolatti,_1996_CITE)."
"Neural maps are suitable to model cortical areas as they capture their important 2D topological organisation and also facilitate the analysis and visualisation of the processes occurring within them ( Caligiore,_Parisi,_&_Baldassarre,_2014_CITE)"
"Population codes ( Pouget,_Dayan,_&_Zemel,_2003_CITE) are based on the idea that information (on stimuli and actions) is encoded in the brain on the basis of the activation of populations of units organised in neural maps having a broad response field"
"To implement the decision making process involved in the mental rotation task, the model uses a mutual inhibition model ( Bogacz_et al.,_2006;_Usher_&_McClelland,_2001_CITE)"
"The iCub is a many degrees of freedom (DOFs) robot built for studying cognitive development in humans ( Cangelosi_&_Schlesinger,_2015;_Sandini_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
"The robot did not hold real objects, but it could move its wrist in order to assume the wrist orientation corresponding (or not) to the orientation of the mentally rotated object, allowing us to study how the mental rotation process can be affected by overt action (ie, the wrist movement and posture) similar to that of experiments involving humans ( Wexler_et al.,_1998;_Wohlschl ger,_2001;_Wohlschl ger_&_Wohlschl ger,_1998_CITE)."
"3 shows the three sets of 2D abstract objects, broadly similar to those employed by Hochberg_and_Gellman_(1977)_CITE, used as stimuli during the mental rotation tasks"
"VC is an image-processing component that extracts the edges of objects from the current image in a way which is reminiscent of early visual cortex processes ( Hubel,_1988_CITE)"
"The two images are red-colour filtered and the edges of each object are extracted with the Canny edge detection technique ( Canny,_1986_CITE; OpenCV library)"
"This integration is performed with a signal multiplication as it is done in the gain-field models to capture what happens in parietal cortex ( Pouget_et al.,_2003;_Pouget_&_Sejnowski,_1997_CITE)"
"The activation of a PPCc unit is then obtained by multiplying the activation of the two input signals (see Fig_4; all the connections of C18 and C19 are equal to 1 when present; see Salinas_&_Abbott,_1996_CITE, for a neural-network implementation using only standard additive neural operations to obtain gain-field effects as those obtainable, as here, with multiplication)"
"In real participants the motor skills corresponding to these connections might form in early life on the basis of reinforcement learning processes ( Barto_&_Sutton,_1998_CITE) not simulated here for simplicity"
"The stochastic process of action selection used here abstracts the winner-take-all action selection mechanisms possibly implemented in basal ganglia-motor cortex loops ( Alexander_et al.,_1986;_Baldassarre,_Caligiore_et al.,_2013_CITE) used in several models of these loops ( Doya,_2000_CITE)."
"This choice was also supported by the result of previous models showing that transformations in space can be generalised over the specific objects involved ( Terekhov_&_O Regan,_2013_CITE)"
"These results qualitatively agree with data obtained from experiments with humans ( Shepard_&_Metzler,_1971;_Wexler_et al.,_1998_CITE)."
"This capability relies on the capacity of the forward models of the model to mentally rotate different possible objects even when they have not been previously experienced, and represents an advancement with respect to previous models that could only rotate objects with which they were trained ( Seepanomwan_et al.,_2013a,_2013b_CITE)."
"The generalisation capability of the forward models to rotate any object (here represented with edges) ultimately relies on the important fact for which translations and rotations in space are transformations that are independent of the features of the specific object being translated or rotated ( Terekhov_&_O Regan,_2013_CITE)"
"In this respect, empirical data (eg, Chu_&_Kita,_2011_CITE) show that if the direction of the overt movement performed during the mental rotation task is congruent with the direction of the mental rotation, participants of the experiments are facilitated to solve the task (lower RT)"
"To this purpose, we assumed that proprioception causes the activation of anterior PC proprioceptive areas in turn activating other associative areas (such as PPCp, Rizzolatti_et al.,_1998_CITE) and we hypothesised that the mentally simulated rotation causes the activation of the same areas"
"This resembles the generalisation capabilities of humans as shown by the classic mental rotation experiments using unusual, novel object images ( Hochberg_&_Gellman,_1977_CITE)"
"This agrees with the proposal that spatial transformations are independent of the objects involved ( Terekhov_&_O Regan,_2013_CITE)"
"Mental rotation can be seen as an instance of planning and as such it could help to improve a robotic performance ( Baldassarre,_2003;_Latombe,_1991;_Lozano-Perez,_1987_CITE)"
"Moreover, the transformations that it requires are independent of the objects being rotated (the same holds for translations, Terekhov_&_O Regan,_2013_CITE)"
"Moreover, it also allows a mechanism for action selection (ie, the mechanism deciding where to rotate the object) based on the relation between the rotated object and the target object, similar to cue-based planning strategies ( Trullier,_Wiener,_Berthoz,_&_Meyer,_1997_CITE)"
"Although this process is commonly used in neural systems to implement planning (eg, see Butz_et al.,_2003_CITE; Grush,_2004_CITE; Ziemke_et al.,_2005_CITE), it is not biologically plausible as the information flows are not managed by neural-like mechanisms ( Baldassarre,_2003_CITE)"
"To our knowledge, how repeated cycles of planning could be managed by dynamical neural systems is an important, difficult, still open problem (but note that the human brain might implement planning on the basis of rather different mechanisms; see Baldassarre,_Mannella_et al.,_2013_CITE, for a biologically-plausible model implementing one-step planning , ie triggering one action based on its goal activation)"
"Now that we have formulated an overall hypothesis on how the mental simulation processes work together, further work might introduce specific learning processes operating within those areas, eg to investigate the formation of neural receptive fields encoding input information in more interesting ways than those used here ( Ognibene,_Rega,_&_Baldassarre,_2006_CITE)"
"Sixth, the model considered only cortical areas of the brain, whereas, as mentioned in the introduction, mental simulation also involves subcortical areas (eg basal-ganglia are involved in the selection of actions and goals and this can be explicitly modelled, Baldassarre,_2002_CITE; Baldassarre,_Mannella_et al.,_2013_CITE; Mannella,_Gurney,_&_Baldassarre,_2013_CITE)"
"Last, the model attention processes are currently hardwired, wherein they could be guided by bottom-up mechanisms based on the features of the image and top-down mechanisms related to the goals of the agent ( Ognibene_&_Baldassare,_2015_CITE)"
"More than 2400 years ago the Athenians offered their capacity of assessing risk before making decisions ( Bernstein,_1996_CITE)"
"For reviews and discussions of the early development of the risk field, see Henley_and_Kumamoto_(1981),_Covello_and_Mumpower_(1985),_Rechard_(1999_CITE, 2000_CITE), Bedford_and_Cooke_(2001),_Thompson,_Deisler,_and_Schwing_(2005)_CITE and Zio_(2007b)_CITE."
"Special attention will be devoted to contributions that can be seen as a result of an integrative thinking process, a thinking which per definition reflects a strong ability to face constructively the tension of opposing ideas and instead of choosing one at the expense of the other, generate a creative resolution of the tension in the form of a new idea that contains elements of the opposing ideas but is superior to each ( Martin,_2009_CITE, p_15)"
"These have contributed to clarifying the content of the risk field and its scientific basis; see Hansson_and_Aven_(2014),_Hollnagel_(2014),_Hale_(2014),_Le_Coze,_Pettersen,_and_Reiman_(2014)_CITE and Aven_(2014)_CITE"
"This understanding (I and II) is in line with a perspective on science as argued for by Hansson_(2013)_CITE, stating that science is the practice that provides us with the epistemically most warranted statements that can be made, at the time being, on subject matters covered by the community of knowledge disciplines, ie on nature, ourselves as human beings, our societies, our physical constructions, and our thought constructions ( Hansson,_2013_CITE)"
"Consider as an example the supply chain risk management area, which has quite recently developed from an emerging topic into a growing research field ( Fahimnia,_Tang,_Davarzani,_&_Sarkis,_2015_CITE)"
"As an example of (I), consider the analysis in Tang_(2006)_CITE, specifically addressing what are the risks that are most relevant for the supply chain area"
Tang_and_Musa_(2011)_CITE highlight that the understanding of what risk is definitely represents a research challenge in supply chain management
"Heckmann_et_al._(2015)_CITE review common perspectives on risk in supply chain management and outline ideas for how to best conceptualise risk, and clearly this type of research is foundational for the supply chain area, but not for the risk field in general"
"The work by Heckmann_et_al._(2015)_CITE is in line with current generic trends on risk conceptualisation as for example summarised by SRA_(2015a,_2015b_CITE), with respect to some issues, but not others (see a comment about this in Section 3)"
"The author of the present paper worked with offshore risk analysis applications, and issues raised there led to generic risk research about risk conceptualisation ( Aven,_2013a_CITE)"
"For another example of work in the borderline between (I) and (II), see Goerlandt_and_Montewka_(2015)_CITE, related to maritime transportation risk"
"See also Aven_and_Renn_(2015)_CITE, who discuss the foundation of the risk and uncertainty work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which is the principal international authority assessing climate risk"
"In Hansson_and_Aven_(2014)_CITE a model which partly builds on ideas taken from Hertz_and_Thomas_(1983)_CITE, is presented, showing the links between facts and values in risk decision-making; see Fig_1."
The SRA_(2015a_CITE) glossary challenges this definition
"Aven_(2014)_CITE presents some examples for this view, including this one: A group of experts believe that a system will not be able to withstand a specific load"
"In line with Hansson_(2013)_CITE, it refers to being the result of a scientific process meeting some criteria set by the scientific environment for the process considered"
"Aven_and_Heide_(2009)_CITE, see also Aven_(2011a)_CITE, provide an in-depth discussion of such criteria"
"As shown by Aven_and_Heide_(2009)_CITE and Aven_(2011a)_CITE, this evaluation depends strongly on the risk perspective adopted"
"Cumming in their editorials of the first issue of the Risk Analysis journal, in relation to the establishment of the Society for Risk Analysis ( Weinberg,_1981_CITE; Cumming,_1981_CITE)"
This topic is discussed by Hansson_and_Aven_(2014)_CITE
Several attempts have been made to establish broadly accepted definitions of key terms related to concepts fundamental for the risk field; see eg Thompson_et_al._(2005)_CITE
"This was the point of departure for a thinking process conducted recently by an expert committee of the Society for Risk Analysis (SRA), which resulted in a new glossary for SRA ( SRA,_2015a_CITE)"
In the following we summarise the risk definition text from SRA_(2015a_CITE):
"Then, if risk is defined according to (d), in line with the recommendations in for example PSA-N_(2015)_CITE and Aven,_Baraldi,_Flage,_and_Zio_(2014)_CITE, risk has two dimensions: the consequences of the operation covering events A such as gas leakages and blowouts, and their effects C for human lives and health; as well as uncertainty U, we do not know now which events will occur and what the effects will be; we face risk"
"Probability is the most common tool, but other tools also exist, including imprecise (interval) probability and representations based on the theories of possibility and evidence, as well as qualitative approaches; see Section 4 and Aven_et_al._(2014),_Dubois_(2010),_Baudrit,_Guyonnet,_and_Dubois_(2006)_CITE and Flage,_Aven,_Baraldi,_and_Zio_(2014)_CITE"
"Arguments for seeing beyond expected values and probabilities in defining and describing risk are summarised in Aven_(2012_CITE, 2015c_CITE); see also Section 4"
It is to be seen as a foundation for the SRA_(2015a_CITE) glossary.
"The uncertainty-founded risk perspectives (eg Aven_et_al.,_2014;_Aven_&_Renn,_2009;_ISO,_2009a,_2009b;_PSA-N,_2015_CITE) indicate that we should also include the pure probability-based perspectives, as the uncertainties are not sufficiently revealed for these perspectives; see also discussion in Section 4"
"Without a proper framework clarifying the difference between the overall risk concept and how it is being measured, it is difficult to know what to look for and make improvements in these tools ( Aven,_2012_CITE)."
"The risk concept is addressed in all fields, whether finance, safety engineering, health, transportation, security or supply chain management ( Althaus,_2005_CITE)"
"Some areas seem to have found the answer a long time ago, for instance the nuclear industry, which has been founded on the Kaplan_and_Garrick_(1981)_CITE definition (the triplet scenarios, consequences and probabilities) for more than three decades; others acknowledge the need for further developments, such as in the supply chain field ( Heckmann_et_al.,_2015_CITE)"
"Heckmann_et_al._(2015)_CITE point to the lack of clarity in understanding what the supply chain risk concept means, and search for solutions"
"To this date, supply chain risk management suffers from the lack of a clear and adequate quantitative measure for supply chain risk that respects the characteristics of modern supply chains ( Heckmann_et_al.,_2015_CITE)."
"Although all areas have special needs, they all face risk as framed in the set-up of the first paragraph of the SRA_(2015a_CITE) text above"
"The former category covers for example expected loss functions and expected square loss, and the latter category, Value-at-Risk (VaR), and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR); see eg Natarajan,_Pachamanova,_and_Sim_(2009)_CITE"
"Research is conducted to analyse their properties and explore how successful they are in providing informative risk descriptions in a decision-making context, under various conditions, for example for a portfolio of projects or securities, and varying degree of uncertainties related to the parameters of the probability models; see eg Natarajan_et_al._(2009),_Shapiro_(2013),_Brandtner_(2013)_CITE and Mitra,_Karathanasopoulos,_Sermpinis,_Christian,_and_Hood_(2015)_CITE"
"Flage_et_al._(2014)_CITE provide a recent perspective on concerns, challenges and directions of development for representing and expressing uncertainty in risk assessment"
Flage_et_al._(2014)_CITE examine the problem and identify issues that are foundational for its treatment
"From this knowledge alone there is no way of representing a specific probability distribution, rather we are led to the use of possibility theory; see Aven_et_al._(2014_CITE, p_46)"
Aven_(2010)_CITE adds another perspective to this discussion
This issue is also discussed by Dubois_(2010)_CITE.
"For a summary of arguments for why this interpretation should be avoided and replaced by a direct comparison approach, see Lindley_(2006_CITE, p_38) and Aven_(2013a)_CITE"
"This latter interpretation is as follows: the probability P( A) = 0.1 (say) means that the assessor compares his/her uncertainty (degree of belief) about the occurrence of the event A with the standard of drawing at random a specific ball from an urn that contains 10 balls ( Lindley,_2006_CITE)."
"Work along these lines is reported in, for example, Flage_and_Aven_(2009)_CITE and Aven_(2014)_CITE, with criteria related to aspects like justification of assumptions made, amount of reliable and relevant data/information, agreement among experts and understanding of the phenomena involved."
"See also discussion by Spiegelhalter_and_Riesch_(2014)_CITE, who provide forms of expression of uncertainty within five levels: event, parameter and model uncertainty and two extra-model levels concerning acknowledged and unknown inadequacies in the modelling process, including possible disagreements about the framing of the problem."
"As commented by the authors of SRA_(2015b)_CITE, many researchers today are more relaxed than previously about using non-probabilistic representations of uncertainty"
"Considerable work has been conducted in this area; see eg Borgonovo_(2006_CITE, 2007_CITE, 2015_CITE), Baraldi,_Zio,_and_Compare_(2009)_CITE and Aven_and_N kland_(2010)_CITE"
In Aven_and_N kland_(2010)_CITE a rethinking of the rationale for the uncertainty importance measures is provided
"Baraldi_et_al._(2009)_CITE have a similar scope, investigating how uncertainties can influence the traditional importance measures, and how one can reflect the uncertainties in the ranking of the components or basic events."
"According to Aven_and_Zio_(2013)_CITE, model uncertainty is to be interpreted as uncertainty about the model error, defined by g( x) y, where y is the quantity we would like to assess and g( x) is a model of y having some parameters x"
"The degree of completeness of an analysis depends on the quality of the analysis and applied cut-offs ( SRA,_2015b_CITE)."
"The work integrates the three major strategies for managing risk as discussed above: risk-informed, cautionary/precautionary and discursive strategies ( Aven_&_Cox,_2015_CITE)."
"Two common interpretations are ( SRA,_2015a_CITE): -a principle expressing that if the consequences of an activity could be serious and subject to scientific uncertainties then precautionary measures should be taken or the activity should not be carried out;-a principle expressing that regulatory actions may be taken in situations where potentially hazardous agents might induce harm to humans or the environment, even if conclusive evidence about the potential harmful effects is not (yet) available."
"If for example the scientific uncertainty is related to the difficulty of establishing a prediction model for the consequences ( Aven,_2011b_CITE), subjective judgements are needed to decide when this is actually the case."
"From the perspective of the present author, a key point is the difference between the cautionary and precautionary principles ( Aven,_2011b_CITE)"
"Considerable works have been conducted in recent years related to robustness in a context of risk and uncertainties; see eg Hites,_De_Smet,_Risse,_Salazar-Neumann,_and_Vincke_(2006),_Baker,_Schubert,_and_Faber_(2008),_Roy_(2010),_Klibi_et_al._(2010),_Joshi_and_Lambert_(2011),_Ben-Haim_(2012),_Fertis_et_al._(2012),_Gabrel,_Murat,_and_Thiele_(2014)_CITE, and Malek,_Baxter,_and_Hsiao_(2015)_CITE"
"Joshi_and_Lambert_(2011)_CITE present an example of a robust management strategy using diversification of engineering infrastructure investments, and Klibi,_Martel,_and_Guitouni_(2010)_CITE discuss robustness of supply chain networks under uncertainty."
Gabrel_et_al._(2014)_CITE underline some of the challenges of robust optimisation
Aven_and_Hiriart_(2013)_CITE illustrate some of these points
"A resilient system has the ability to ( Hollnagel,_Woods,_&_Leveson,_2006_CITE): respond to regular and irregular threats in a robust yet flexible (adaptive) manner, monitor what is going on, including its own performance, anticipate risk events and opportunities, learn from experience.Through a mix of alertness, quick detection, and early response, the failures can be avoided"
"Considerable work has been conducted on this topic in recent years; see for example Weick_and_Sutcliffe_(2007),_Lundberg_and_Johansson_(2015),_Sahebjamnia,_Torabi,_and_Mansouri_(2015),_Patterson_and_Wears_(2015),_Righi,_Saurin,_and_Wachs_(2015)_CITE and Bergstr m,_van_Winsen,_and_Henriqson_(2015)_CITE"
"According to Righi_et_al._(2015)_CITE, resilience engineering supports studies in risk assessments, identification and classification of resilience, training and accident analysis, and it should be seen in relation to the theory of complex systems"
Bergstr m_et_al._(2015)_CITE confirm this and argue that resilience engineering scholars typically motivate the need for their studies by referring to the inherent complexities of modern socio-technical systems; complexities that make these systems inherently risky
"The object of resilience then becomes the capacity to adapt to such emerging risks in order to guarantee the success of the inherently risky system ( Bergstr m_et_al.,_2015_CITE)"
"These problems are addressed in resilience engineering, which argues for more appropriate models and methods for such systems; see eg Hollnagel_et_al._(2006)_CITE"
"Alternative methods have been developed, of which FRAM and STAMP are among the most well-known ( Hollnagel,_2004;_Leveson_2004_CITE, 2011_CITE)"
"With sufficiently broad risk management frameworks, the resilience dimension is a part of risk management as was highlighted at the beginning of this section, and discussed for example by Steen_and_Aven_(2011)_CITE and Aven_(2015b)_CITE"
"The latter reference relates to the antifragility concept of Taleb_(2012)_CITE, which builds on and extends the resilience concept"
"Taleb_(2012_CITE, pp_ 4 5) proposes to stand current approaches to prediction, prognostication, and risk management on their heads"
"These tools are founded on two strategies: finding robust decisions that work acceptably well for many models (those in the uncertainty set); and adaptive risk management, or learning what to do by well-designed and analysed trial and error ( Cox,_2012_CITE)."
"On an overarching level, the basic process is straightforward: one chooses an action based on broad considerations of risk and other aspects, monitors the effect, and adjusts the action based on the monitored results ( Linkov_et_al.,_2006_CITE)"
"See also Pettersen_(2013)_CITE who discusses abductive thinking, which is closely linked to adaptive analysis."
"Aven_(2013b)_CITE provides some reflections on some of the foundational pillars on which the work by Cox_(2012)_CITE is based, including the meaning of the concept of deep uncertainty"
"For some alternative perspectives on how to meet deep uncertainties, see Karvetski_and_Lambert_(2012)_CITE and Lambert_et_al._(2012)_CITE, who seek to turn the conventional robustness discussion away from its urgency to know which action is most robust and towards identifying which are the uncertainties that matter most, which matter least, which present opportunities, and which present threats, and why"
"Different types of black swans have been defined and measures to meet them discussed (eg Aven,_2015d;_Aven_&_Krohn,_2014;_Pat -Cornell,_2012_CITE)"
"As highlighted by Aven_(2015b)_CITE, the basic idea of addressing black swans is to obtain a stronger focus on issues not covered by the traditional risk perspectives, highlighting historical data, probabilities and expected values (the world of Mediocristan in Taleb's terminology)"
"Such constraints are often referred to as risk criteria, risk acceptance criteria and tolerability criteria; see eg Rodrigues,_Arezes,_and_Le o_(2014)_CITE and Vanem_(2012)_CITE"
"This practice is, however, debated, and in a recent paper Abrahamsen_and_Aven_(2012)_CITE argue that it should be reconsidered"
The critique against the use of such criteria also covers other aspects; see eg Aven_(2015a)_CITE
"As strongly highlighted by for example Apostolaksis_(2004)_CITE, a risk decision should be risk-informed, not risk-based"
"The principle's practical implementation is still a matter of discussion and research; see eg Ale,_Hartford,_and_Slater_(2015),_French,_Bedford,_and_Atherton_(2005),_Melchers_(2001),_Vinnem,_Wits ,_and_Kristensen_(2006)_CITE and Jones-Lee_and_Aven_(2011)_CITE"
"And this is commonly done, but should be used with care as these cost-benefit criteria do not adequately reflect the uncertainty component of risk ( Aven_&_Abrahamsen,_2007_CITE)"
"Uncertainty assessments extending beyond the cost-benefit analyses consequently need to be supplemented with broader processes, as discussed for example by Aven_and_Vinnem_(2007)_CITE."
"Several frameworks have been developed with such an aim, eg the risk frameworks of Renn_(2008)_CITE and Aven_and_Krohn_(2014)_CITE"
"The second area relates to the quality discourse, with its focus on variation, system thinking and continuous improvements ( Bergman_&_Klefsj ,_2003_CITE; Deming,_2000_CITE), while the third includes the concept of antifragility ( Taleb,_2012_CITE)."
"The future of risk assessment and risk management is discussed in SRA_(2015b)_CITE and Aven_and_Zio_(2014)_CITE; see also reviews and reflections by Venkatasubramanian_(2011),_Pasman_and_Reniers_(2014)_CITE and Khan,_Rathnayaka,_and_Ahmed_(2015)_CITE."
"Such situations call for different types of approaches and methods, and it is a main challenge for the risk field to develop suitable frameworks and tools for this purpose ( SRA,_2015b_CITE)"
The paper by Aven_(2013c)_CITE provides an example of a work in this direction.
"One example to add is the link between sustainability and risk, which is an emerging research topic; see eg Fahimnia_et_al._(2015)_CITE and Giannakis_and_Papadopoulos_(2016)_CITE."
"In recent years, with the rapid development of motion capture (mocap) techniques and systems, motion capture data have been widely used in computer games, film production and sport sciences [38,39,42,52]_CITE"
"For example, the interpolation methods used in some commercial mocap systems such as EVaRT and Vicon are only suitable to deal with the short-time (<0.5 s) data missing problem [1]_CITE"
"It is not exaggerated to say that the refinement problem is far from being solved and has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years [1,2,4,5,12,19,23,37,47,58]_CITE."
"How to predict missing values in mocap data has been studied by many researchers [1,4,17,23,30,31,57,58]_CITE in the past twenty years"
Aristidou et al [1]_CITE used Kalman Filters to estimate missing markers in real-time without the support of any human model
"Moreover, Kalman Filters may fail when markers are missing or the motion data is corrupted by noise for an extended time period [12]_CITE"
"To discover hidden variables and learn their dynamics, Li et al [30]_CITE built a probabilistic model to estimate the expectation of missing values conditioned on the observed parts"
Their next work [31]_CITE imposed bone-length constraints in a linear dynamical system (LDS) to boost the performance
Xiao et al [58]_CITE adopted sparse representation to predict the missing values and Baumann et al [4]_CITE fixed missing data via searching poses with a similar marker set from a prior-database and then optimizing an energy minimization function to synthesize the positional data of the missing markers
"Lai et al [23]_CITE noticed that the low-rank property of mocap data has not been explicitly exploited in the previous work, and they proposed to handle the mocap data refinement problem based on low-rank matrix completion theory and algorithm"
"Our proposed model can handle both sub-problems of mocap data refinement at the same time, while in [23]_CITE they used two separate models to achieve the same goal"
"Meanwhile, we also notice that two low-rank matrix based methods [19,47]_CITE have been proposed almost at the same time as ours following the work [23]_CITE"
"However, both papers [19,47]_CITE aim to well use the low-rank property of the trajectory matrix of human motion data by reorganizing mocap data into sequences of trajectory segments"
"There are also a lot of research focusing on removing the noise and outliers from mocap data, which is called mocap data de-noising [20,23,24,26,27,37]_CITE"
Lee and Shin [26]_CITE formulated rotation smoothing as a nonlinear optimization problem and iteratively minimized the energy function to smooth the motion
"In their later work [27]_CITE, they proposed a linear time-invariant filtering framework for filtering the orientation data by transforming the orientation data into their analogues in a vector space; applying a time-domain filter on them; and transforming the results back to the orientation space"
Lou and her colleagues [37]_CITE learned a series of filter bases from prerecorded mocap data and then used them in a robust nonlinear optimization framework to perform mocap data denoising
"In other words, if we represent this sequence in a motion matrix form X=[f1,f2, ,fn] Rd n, it is naturally to guess that X should have a low-rank structure [23]_CITE"
"The metric we used here is the relative approximation error of the top K biggest singular values, ie, 1- iK i2/ ir i2, where i is the i-th largest singular value and ir i2 gives the total variance of the matrix XTX [43,50]_CITE"
"Additionally, natural human motion satisfies the temporal stability constraint, ie, the motion trajectories of markers are smooth most of the time [9,44,49]_CITE"
"Meanwhile, Cand et al [8]_CITE proved that it is possible to recover most low-rank matrices from what appears to be an incomplete set of entries"
"This requirement leads to (Y)= YOT F2 [10,14,28]_CITE, and O is tridiagonal square matrix defined by (3)Oi,i-1=2hi-1(hi-1+hi), (4)Oi,i=-2hi-1hi, (5)Oi-1,i=2hi(hi-1+hi),for i,2 i n-1, where n is the number of elements in Yr,: and hi represents the step between Yr,i and Yr,i+1"
"Since Eq (7) is a l0-norm regularized rank-minimization problem, which is NP-hard, in most matrix completion problems the l1-norm and the nuclear norm are often used as surrogates of matrix rank and the l0-norm respectively [7,11,53,56]_CITE"
"Several weighting functions are available to achieve this goal, such as the bisquare weight function [14,16]_CITE and the Welsch robust function [37]_CITE and so on"
"Because (I+ OTO) is a sparse symmetric matrix, Eq (14) can be efficiently solved [15,32]_CITE."
"In order to set it correctly and automatically, we resort to the method of generalized cross-validation (GCV) [10,28]_CITE"
"To solve the proposed TSMC model, we first introduce a slack matrix M=Y to decouple the terms containing Y in Eq (8), and our model equivalent to: (21)minY,E,M Y + E 1+ 2 MO F2, (22)s.t.Y+E=X, (23)Y=M.Indeed, the above low-rank matrix completion problem Eq (21) can be efficiently solved via many algorithms such as the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm [34,55]_CITE, the SVT algorithm [7]_CITE and the augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) algorithm [33]_CITE"
"Here we denote the singular value shrinkage operator S [7,33,53]_CITE as (25)[D (A)]ij=sgn(Aij)(|Aij|- )+, (26)S (B)=UBD BVBT,where B=UB BVBT is the SVD of B"
"To quantify the refined results, following the work [4,19,30,47,51,58]_CITE, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) measurement is adopted: (27)RMSE(fi,f i)=1np fi-f i 2,where fi is the imperfect pose, fi is the refined pose and np is the total number of imperfect entries (ie, missing and noise entries) in fi."
"Since it is at most about 30 40% of the data is missing or noisy in practice [29]_CITE, we fix the ratio of the missing or noisy data to 30 40% to evaluate all the algorithms"
"As shown in the last sub-image of Fig_11(c), one head marker predicted by Dynammo [30]_CITE drifts a little away due to the reason that this marker is missing for a long period of time at the end of the motion data"
"To demystify this inconsistency, we find that SVT [30]_CITE convergences too early in handling a large-scale imperfect human motion matrix in these two cases where the total frame numbers are 4840 and 4905"
"Before introducing how to derivate the updating rules for our Algorithm 2, we give an useful theorem from some literatures [7,33,34,53]_CITE as follows"
"Thus, software development is hugely dependent on people ( DeMarco_and_Lister,_2013)_CITE"
"Intellectual capital may be defined as: the sum of all knowledge firms utilize for competitive advantage ( Nahapiet_and_Ghoshal,_1998;_Youndt_et_al.,_2004_CITE)"
Here it is chosen to use the division discussed by Youndt_et_al._(2004)_CITE
"Youndt_et_al._(2004)_CITE divide the general concept of intellectual capital into three ICCs: human capital, social capital and organizational capital"
"In this context, Feldmann and Althoff have defined a learning software organization as an organization that is able to create a culture that promotes continuous learning and fosters the exchange of experience ( Feldmann_and_Althoff,_2001_CITE)"
"Dyb places more emphasis on action in his definition: A software organization that promotes improved actions through better knowledge and understanding ( Dyb ,_2001_CITE)."
"Intellectual capital is called the main asset of software companies ( Gongla_and_Rizzuto,_2001;_Rus_and_Lindvall,_2002_CITE)"
"It is seen as a construct with various levels (individual, network, and organizational) ( Youndt_et_al.,_2004_CITE)"
"As mentioned above, Youndt_et_al._(2004)_CITE divide intellectual capital into three components: human, social and organizational capitals"
"Therefore, Willcocks_et_al._(2004)_CITE propose a framework, which also includes a fourth kind of ICC social capital"
"Symptomatically, the ratio of the software development industry is found to be seven times the ratio of other industries that are heavily reliant on physical capital, such as the steel industry ( Bontis,_1997,_1998;_Tobin,_1969_CITE)"
"In a study on intellectual capital in Systematic Software Engineering Ltd, Mouritsen_et_al._(2001)_CITE found that the main motivation for understanding the different elements of intellectual capital was to make the company's knowledge resources and key competency areas visible and to monitor management's efforts to develop these"
"Youndt_et_al._(2004)_CITE, through their review of intellectual capital, conceptualize intellectual capital through the three distinct components: human, social, and organizational"
"In software engineering these are often associated with technical skills including design expertise, domain knowledge and product knowledge ( Faraj_and_Sproull,_2000;_Moe_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Social capital is both the network and the assets that may be mobilized through that network ( Bourdieu,_1986_CITE)"
"In the research on social capital, scholars have tended to adopt either an external viewpoint (the relations an actor maintains with other actors) or an internal viewpoint (the structure of relations among actors within a grouping) ( Adler_and_Kwon,_2002_CITE)"
"In this table, the information on how the concepts synthesized by Youndt_et_al._(2004)_CITE link to software engineering is provided as based on Moe_et_al._(2014)_CITE."
"Organizational learning theorists ( Nonaka_and_Takeuchi,_1995;_Sch n,_1983_CITE) point out that organizations do not create knowledge; rather people, or human capital, is the origin of all knowledge"
"Also it is suggested that: individual learning is a necessary but insufficient condition for organizational learning ( Argyris_and_Sch n,_1996_CITE)"
The need for a firm theoretical basis for software engineering has been emphasized since the infancy of the area as exemplified by Freeman_et_al._(1976)_CITE
Specific theories for software engineering were also proposed such as Musa's_(1975)_CITE theory with respect to estimation of software reliability
"The field has progressed since but there are still no commonly accepted theories for software engineering ( Ralph_et_al.,_2013_CITE)"
"The need to build theories has been emphasized by, for example, Sj berg_et_al._(2008)_CITE and more lately by Johnson_et_al._(2012)_CITE"
"In addition to theories, laws and empirical observations have helped to increase the understanding of the discipline as described by Endres_and_Rombach_(2003)_CITE"
"Some examples include Conway's law ( Conway,_1968_CITE) with respect to the relationship between system structure and organization, and Lehman's laws ( Lehman,_1979_CITE) on software evolution."
"Endres_and_Rombach_(2003)_CITE take it one-step further and explain how the law can be interpreted as a theory, since there is a logical explanation to the law"
"Lehman puts forward five laws on software evolution ( Lehman,_1979_CITE)"
"Example 1: The product documentation was deemed insufficient for a transfer, and hence nine person-months were spent on improving the product documentation before transferring a software product ( mite_and_Wohlin,_2010_CITE)."
"Example 2: A gradual transfer ( Wohlin_and_ mite,_2012_CITE) was conducted, ie, joint development between sites was organized before transferring the software product"
"Example 3: Temporal relocation of experts from the sending site with the product to the receiving site has been seen as a common practice to ensure the presence and accessibility of expertise and to transfer knowledge to the teams receiving the software product ( mite_and_Wohlin,_2010_CITE)."
"According to the different types of theories described in Sj berg_et_al._(2008_CITE), the theory of balancing the ICCs for software development and evolution is primarily explanatory, although it may also help managers to answer what if questions, and hence at least partially help in prediction, or at least in reasoning about the effects of changes"
Sj berg_et_al._(2008)_CITE proposed these steps as suitable for formulating theories (in software engineering)
"When developing software, it is possible to have different levels of ambition from an organizational perspective ( Rajlich_and_Bennett,_2000_CITE); ambition is here used in a general sense"
"Here, it is chosen to follow the division by Youndt_et_al._(2004)_CITE, where intellectual capital is divided into: human, social and organization capitals"
"It should be noted that ICCs are intended to cover all aspects of knowledge available to a company, ie it is the sum of all knowledge ( Nahapiet_and_Ghoshal,_1998;_Youndt_et_al.,_2004_CITE)"
"Furthermore, social capital plays an interesting role since it may facilitate the development of intellectual capital ( Nahapiet_and_Ghoshal,_1998_CITE), for example, good networking with experts outside a unit facilitates learning, the human capital may increase accordingly, and hence increasing the intellectual capital as a whole."
"Based on the experience from working with industry ( Wohlin_et_al.,_2012_CITE) in general, and in particular the research in relation to global software engineering in close industrial collaboration that may be exemplified with the work related to software transfers as reported by mite_and_Wohlin_(2012)_CITE, it is clear that managers in practice do balance different components of intellectual capital"
"Empirical cases are used in the theory-building process for examination of the validity of theories ( Sj berg_et_al.,_2008_CITE)"
"The case study was designed as an exploratory study ( Yin,_2009_CITE) to investigate the interplay between the human, social and organizational capitals, as well as its relation to the organization's ability to develop and evolve software products"
"Even though agile methods emphasize teamwork more than traditional development methods do ( Nerur_et_al.,_2005_CITE), there is no thorough investigation of the effect of teamwork quality (TWQ) on project success in agile teams."
"Agile development methods are used as an umbrella term to describe a number of development methods ( Dings yr_et_al.,_2012;_Dyb _and_Dings yr,_2008_CITE)"
"Collaboration and coordination are also central in the agile literature ( Sharp_and_Robinson,_2010;_Strode_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"Team members coordinate their work frequently, such as in daily stand-up meetings ( Stray_et_al.,_2016_CITE)"
Vinekar_et_al._(2006)_CITE explain that agile development and traditional development have different views on teamwork
"Several studies have investigated the effect of teamwork quality (TWQ) on project success in traditional software teams ( Hoegl_and_Gemuenden,_2001;_Hoegl_et_al.,_2003;_Hoegl_et_al.,_2004;_Janz,_1999;_Li_et_al.,_2010;_Ryan_and_O'Conner,_2009;_Vinod_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"In traditional development, the study by Faraj_and_Sproull_(2000)_CITE showed a strong relationship between management of expertise and team performance"
"Another study demonstrated the importance of cooperative learning on project success for software development teams ( Janz,_1999_CITE)"
"In agile development, a few studies analyzed teamwork using team performance models, such as the one found in Moe_et_al._(2010)_CITE"
"Sharp_and_Robinson_(2010)_CITE described how agile development teams enable collaboration, co-ordination, and communication"
"Another study Pikkarainen_et_al._(2008_CITE), focused on how agile development methods improve communication, and claimed that Scrum and XP practices improve both formal and informal communication"
Maruping_et_al._(2009)_CITE demonstrated that XP practices of collective code ownership and coding standards could lead to increased technical quality of software products
"A survey of success factors of agile development found that team capability was one of the factors ( Chow_and_Cao,_2008_CITE)."
"Detailed models that show relationships between various aspects of teamwork quality and team performance have been used in studies of software teams; for example, those described in Hoegl_and_Gemuenden_(2001_CITE), Salas_et_al._(2005_CITE), Dickinson_and_McIntyre_(1997_CITE) and Janz_(1999_CITE)"
"In this work, we focus on the factors described by Hoegl_and_Gemuenden_(2001)_CITE."
"We use the construct of teamwork quality conceived by Hoegl_and_Gemuenden_(2001)_CITE, which refers only to the quality of interactions"
"TWQ is conceptualized as a higher order construct and is based on Hackman's input-process-output model on group behaviour and effectiveness ( Hackman,_1987_CITE) and derived from McGrath_(1964)_CITE"
Pinto_and_Pinto_(1990)_CITE describe quality of communication within a team in terms of frequency and formalization of the information exchange
"It is also critical for the quality of communication that team members share their information openly with each other ( Gladstein,_1984_CITE)"
Malone_and_Crowston_(1994)_CITE describe coordination as managing dependencies between activities
"Harmonization and synchronization of these individual activities are important for the TWQ and project success ( Tannenbaum_et_al.,_1992;_Brannick_et_al._1995_CITE)"
"The contribution of the task-relevant knowledge and experience of all members to the decision-making processes of the team may benefit the team ( Hackman,_1987;_Seers_et_al.,_1995_CITE)"
"The daily meetings ( Stray_et_al.,_2016_CITE) in agile teams support such a balance of member contribution."
"A competitive attitude meaning self-interest at the expense of overall performance of the team tasks may not benefit the work of the team ( Tjosvold,_1998_CITE)"
"Hackman_(1987)_CITE describes conditions that support effort, and says it is important that interaction among members minimizes social loafing and instead promotes a shared commitment among members to the team and its work"
"Prioritization of a team's tasks over other tasks is a good indicator of the effort that team members spend on common tasks ( Hackman,_1987;_Pinto_and_Pinto,_1990_CITE)"
"In a focus group study of what hinders and what fosters effective teamwork in agile teams, prioritizing the team's tasks was perceived as one of the most important factors for achieving better team performance ( Dings yr_and_Lindsj rn,_2013_CITE)."
"A common definition of team cohesion is a dynamic process that is reflected in the tendency for a group to stick together and remain united in the pursuit of its goals and objectives ( Mudrack,_1989_CITE)"
"Mullen_and_Copper_(1994)_CITE distinguish between three aspects of team cohesion: (1) commitment to the team tasks, (2) interpersonal attraction of team members, and (3) group pride/team spirit"
"In a survey of 31 software teams, team cohesion was found to be the dominating factor when investigating the influence of team cohesion, team experience, and team capability on team performance ( Lakhpanel,_1993_CITE)"
"The conceptualization of project success as a multi-variable construct is described in Gladstein_(1984_CITE), Hackman_(1987_CITE), Sundstrom_et_al._(1990_CITE), Pinto_et_al._(1993_CITE) and Denison_et_al._(1996_CITE)"
"Team performance may be defined as the extent to which a team is able to meet established quality, cost, and time objectives ( Hoegl_and_Gemuenden,_2001_CITE)"
"Many team performance models and teamwork frameworks describe TWQ and its relation to team performance in general, eg, Mathieu_et_al._(2008_CITE), Cohen_and_Bailey_(1997_CITE) and Rasmussen_and_Jeppesen_(2006_CITE)."
"Team performance and team effectiveness are often used synonymously in the literature; sometimes team performance is part of team effectiveness, eg, Cohen_and_Bailey_(1997_CITE), and sometimes team effectiveness is part of team performance, eg, Hoegl_and_Gemuenden_(2001_CITE)"
"Most of the models of team performance (or team effectiveness) originate from management science and psychology ( Salas_et_al.,_2007_CITE)"
"Teams should work in a way that increases the motivation of team members and their ability to engage in future teamwork ( Hackman,_1987;_Sundstrom_et_al.,_1990_CITE)"
"In some team performance models, eg, Janz_(1999_CITE), learning is defined as one of the aspects of TWQ, and thus is seen as a contribution to the success of a project its outcome and not as a part of the outcome itself."
Hoegl_and_Gemuenden_(2001)_CITE give a detailed account of both the theoretical rationale and empirical evidence for the positive relationship between TWQ and both software team performance and team members success
Hoegl_and_Gemuenden_(2001)_CITE studied traditional teams; we studied agile teams
Nunnally_and_Bernstein_(1994)_CITE consider a Cronbach's alpha higher than 0.7 as satisfactory
"Confirmatory statistical analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) as implemented in the lavaan package ( Rosseel,_2012_CITE) using R ( R_Core_Team,_2015_CITE)"
"SEM allows the specification of a system of equations for two main types of models simultaneously ( Anderson_and_Gerbing,_1988_CITE)"
"A purely data-analytic distinction is whether a variable is observed or latent ( Borsboom,_2008_CITE)"
"The covariance matrix for the traditional survey was calculated using the correlation matrix, means and standard deviations reported in Hoegl_and_Gemuenden_(2001)_CITE"
"In addition to low statistical power for rejecting a poorly fitting model, there were also problems with highly correlated indicators resulting in a nonpositive definite matrix during estimation, see, eg, ( Wothke,_1993_CITE) and negative error variance"
"Using the model described in Section 3.5, Hoegl_and_Gemuenden's_(2001)_CITE data displayed an unacceptable confirmatory model fit ( 2[71] = 224.90, RMSEA = 0.123 [0.105 0.141]"
The fact that the team members rated both TWQ and team performance may have created implicit models among team members as proposed by Gladstein_(1984)_CITE: It appears that individuals have implicit models of how certain modes of group process should benefit performance and attribute good outcomes to the group when the appropriate process has been instituted
"More generally, MacKenzie_and_Podsakoff_(2012)_CITE showed in a meta-analysis that the correlations between the independent and dependent variables inflated from 133 to 304 percent when the same rater evaluated both."
Hoegl_and_Gemuenden_(2001)_CITE explain another implicit model
"Because managers (product owners in our survey) lack detailed information about relevant performance measures, they evaluate the outcomes based on their general impression of the expertise of the team leader or other team members, rather than solely considering actual performance ( Hoegl_and_Gemuenden,_2001_CITE)"
"Furthermore, Cohen_and_Bailey_(1997)_CITE observed, Team members tend to rate the team's performance high if the team has engaged in healthy internal processes, such as collaboration and resolution of conflict"
"Managers, who may be less intimate with the group's internal dynamics, rate a team highly according to more external factors, like the amount of communication the group has with external agents ( Cohen_&_Bailey,_1997_CITE)"
"Another explanation might be the restriction of range ( Shadish_et_al,_2002_CITE) in the response scale of these variables"
"Since the participants of the survey by Hoegl_and_Gemuenden_(2001)_CITE were not asked explicitly about development methods, we need to justify the identification of the teams in that survey as having a traditional approach"
"On the other hand, the best performing teams will both deliver better product and project quality, something that should be taken into account in future work where team performance is operationalized; see Bergersen_et_al._(2011_CITE)."
"We present a general model framework and a case study based on realistic data from the Norwegian natural gas transportation system that covers nearly 20 percent of European gas consumption (Norwegian_Petroleum_Directorate,_2012)_CITE."
"These services allow the TSO to oversell the capacity by reselling capacity that is booked firm but not nominated without relieving the obligation to the original buyer, as described in Doane,_McAfee,_Nayyar,_and_Williams_(2008)_CITE"
"The intention of the interruptible services is to improve the short term redistribution of transportation capacity to support an efficient use of the network (Ruff,_2012)_CITE"
"Within the power sector the N-1 method, requiring feasible operation even if one element in the network goes down, is a traditional way of providing robustness in case of contingencies (see for instance Vournas,_2001_CITE)"
"Bopp,_Kannan,_Palocsay,_and_Stevens_(1996)_CITE use a set of business rules to achieve satisfactory security of supply when optimizing the planning problem of a local natural gas distribution company"
Guldmann_and_Wang_(1999)_CITE include a curtailment cost on not satisfied demand for a similar problem
"Furthermore, the system operator must take into account system effects that make it impossible to a priori determine fixed capacities (see Midthun,_Bj rndal,_and_Tomasgard,_2009_CITE)"
"This corresponds to the arguments by Vazquez,_Hallack,_and_Glachant_(2012)_CITE who point out that the shipper simplified view on the transportation network, only acting in accordance with entry and exit booking points, requires the TSO to withhold some capacity to match the booking obligations with the physical network capabilities."
"Midthun,_Nowak,_and_Tomasgard_(2007)_CITE and Keyaerts,_Hallack,_Glachant,_and_D haeseleer_(2011)_CITE show that linepack also has a commercial value that introduces a trade-off in relation to security of supply"
"Martin,_M ller,_and_Moritz_(2006)_CITE and Tomasgard,_R mo,_Fodstad,_and_Midthun_(2007)_CITE optimizes a steady-state representation of gas network pressures and flows"
"Moritz_(2007)_CITE models transient flows, while Ulstein,_Nygreen,_and_Sagli_(2007)_CITE, Selot,_Kuok,_Robinson,_Mason,_and_Barton_(2008)_CITE and Li,_Armagan,_Tomasgard,_and_Barton_(2011)_CITE model gas quality issues"
"To keep our model in accordance with the current regime on the NCS, we use fixed tariffs and the tariffs for interruptible services are lower than for firm (Gassco,_2012)_CITE."
"In accordance with the separate responsibilities of TSO and shipper in an entry exit system (Alonso,_Olmos,_and_Serrano,_2010)_CITE, the shipper does not see the pipelines, but rather a fully connected network."
"This constant depends on characteristics of the pipeline such as diameter, length and roughness (for more details, see for instance Campbell_(1992)_CITE)"
"Since (22) is not linear, an outer approximation derived by Taylor series expansion around fixed pressure points PIl and POl is used (R mo_et al.,_2009)_CITE: (23)fj,i,s2 Kj,iW(PIlPIl2 POl2pi,s2 POlPIl2 POl2pj,s2)l L,s2 S2,where the set L gives the fixed points used for the linearization"
"The basis for the topology is given in Norwegian_Petroleum_Directorate_(2011)_CITE, while details on production and transportation capacities and plans are confidential and provided by the Norwegian system operator, Gassco"
"The booking tariffs for firm transportation capacity correspond to the real tariffs on the NCS, defined individually for each booking node, and are available at Gassco_(2012)_CITE"
"The production costs of must-take production are estimated based on gas-to-oil ratios in Norwegian_Petroleum_Directorate_(2011)_CITE, where larger oil share gives a larger marginal production cost"
The probability and extent of the capacity reductions are calibrated so that the availability corresponds to the average availability figures reported by Gassco_(2010)_CITE; 2011_CITE)
"Can human interaction over the internet be personally and socially transformative? The introduction of new, disruptive technology is always accompanied by a deep suspicion for example, the telephone was greeted by claims that it would break up home life and stop people from visiting friends ( Fischer,_1992;_Pool,_1983_CITE) and the internet has been no exception to this rule (see, eg, Putnam,_2000_CITE)"
"Online forums have been in existence for many years, and indeed predate the internet ( Li_&_Bernoff,_2011_CITE)"
"Although seemingly eclipsed in the past decade by social networking sites such as Facebook, forums are still regularly used by around 20% of online users in the US, and about 10% of online users in the UK ( Li_&_Bernoff,_2011_CITE), attesting to the value that users continue to derive from them"
"If time spent interacting online comes at the expense of vital everyday face-to-face interaction with family and friends, there could be negative implications for users psychological wellbeing downstream (eg, Mesch,_2001;_Nie,_Hillygus,_&_Erbring,_2002_CITE)"
"Heavy internet users report feeling more isolated from society and report fewer interactions with family and friends ( Nie_&_Hillygus,_2002;_Nie_et_al.,_2002_CITE)"
"Time spent online has been shown to be associated with increased depression and other emotional problems ( Carden_&_Rettew,_2006;_Morgan_&_Cotton,_2003_CITE) and impaired academic performance ( Junco,_2012_CITE)"
"Using the internet to meet people is also associated with depression ( Boneva,_Quinn,_Kraut,_Kiesler,_&_Shklovski,_2006_CITE)."
"An influential set of studies provides perhaps the most definitive tests of these ideas ( Kraut_et_al.,_1998_CITE)"
"First, others data have not been fully supportive (see LaRose,_Eastin,_&_Gregg,_2001;_Morgan_&_Cotton,_2003_CITE)"
"They also collected fresh data several years after the earlier study and found that participants in this later sample experienced mostly positive effects of using the Internet ( Kraut_et_al.,_2002_CITE)"
"Taking the later data into account, many researchers have arrived at a more positive view of the consequences of internet use, arguing that online interaction can supplement rather than supplant face-to-face interaction ( DiMaggio,_Hargittai,_Neuman,_&_Robinson,_2001;_Wellman,_Haase,_Witte,_&_Hampton,_2001_CITE)"
"First, the internet helps to maintain geographically dispersed networks: it can prevent communities, families, and friends from becoming too fragmented by providing sources of social support regardless of users physical location ( Howard,_Rainie,_&_Jones,_2001;_Subrahmanyam,_Reich,_Waechter,_&_Espinoza,_2008_CITE)"
"Second, getting involved in online groups can be of huge benefit to those with somewhat depleted offline social resources ( McKenna_&_Bargh,_1998_CITE); developing relationships with individuals and groups online may help compensate for the social resources that are lacking offline"
"Last, internet interaction has been positively linked to the development of social capital ( Best_&_Krueger,_2006;_Ellison,_Steinfield,_&_Lampe,_2007,_2011;_Gross,_Juvonen,_&_Gable,_2002;_Hampton_&_Wellman,_2003;_Kavanaugh,_Carroll,_Rosson,_Reese,_&_Zin,_2005;_Kraut_et_al.,_2002;_Quan-Haase,_Wellman,_Witte,_&_Hampton,_2002;_Robinson,_Kestnbaum,_Neustadtl,_&_Alvarez,_2000_CITE)"
"Offline (face-to face) social capital has been shown to decrease dropout rates, and increase students sense of belonging and well-being in academic settings ( Garcia-Reid,_2007_CITE) and similar benefits have been shown among members of virtual communities ( Tomai_et_al.,_2010_CITE)."
"But there is suggestive evidence that online engagement can translate into offline collective action, such as civic and political participation (eg, Valenzuela,_Park,_&_Kee,_2009_CITE)"
"After this intervention, follow-up data suggested that the internet actually stimulates more offline contact (resonating with the debate reviewed above) and promotes collective action to solve community problems offline (see also Blanchard_&_Horan,_1998_CITE)."
"There are, however, exceptions to this pattern (eg, Byrne,_2007_CITE)"
"A recent meta-analysis of the link between internet use and political/civic engagement suggests it is far from inevitable ( Boulianne,_2009_CITE)"
"Identification reflects, and is expressed by, the inclusion of the ingroup in the self-concept ( Tropp_&_Wright,_2001_CITE)"
"Why is identification important? Social identity theory ( Tajfel_&_Turner,_1979_CITE) posits that our group memberships are just as important as individual identity in defining the self (see Ellemers,_Spears,_&_Doosje,_2002_CITE) and thus are equally important determinants of our downstream outcomes mediated by the self-concept (such as well-being and behavior)"
"First, at the individual level, group identification has been robustly linked to health and well-being, both in terms of effective coping with situational stressors ( Haslam_&_Reicher,_2006_CITE) and in the longer term"
"For example, a significant body of work is accumulating that suggests social group memberships, and more specifically, engagement in activities associated with such groups, can play a significant protective role in both the onset of and recovery from depression (see Cruwys,_Haslam,_Dingle,_Haslam,_&_Jetten,_2014_CITE, for an overview of this extensive program of research)"
"Second, at the societal level, group identification is also quite often linked to heightened civic engagement, in the sense that it is almost an accepted given that they somehow go together ( Youniss,_2011_CITE)"
"Those with a strong political identity are more inclined to engage in civic activities such as political activism ( Stewart_&_McDermott,_2004_CITE) and protest participation ( Klandermans,_2002_CITE)"
"Within environmental psychology, too, there is suggestive evidence that identification promotes environmental activism ( Dono,_Webb,_&_Richardson,_2010;_Fielding,_McDonald,_&_Louis,_2008_CITE)"
"And sufficiently many findings in the social psychological literature affirm the role of identification in collective action that an influential paper putting forward a social identity model of collective action was needed to integrate them ( van_Zomeren,_Postmes,_&_Spears,_2008_CITE)"
"People may strategically express identities when they think they will not be punished, and/or connect them to an audience that is valued ( Spears,_Lea,_Corneliussen,_Postmes,_&_Ter_Haar,_2002_CITE)"
"Moreover, low identifiers will begin to identify with a group when they anticipate that the group is about to benefit from positive social change, but will dis-identify when change is unlikely ( Doosje,_Spears,_&_Ellemers,_2002_CITE)."
"Our rationale in considering the antecedents of forum identification was influenced by the uses and gratifications approach ( Herzog,_1944;_Katz,_Blumler,_&_Gurevitch,_1974_CITE), a second theoretical perspective that complements the social identity approach"
"Because online communication provides disparate gratification opportunities compared with traditional media, individuals may find it superior to face-to-face communication, if that richer medium is not considered fit for purpose ( Dimmick,_Kline,_&_Stafford,_2000_CITE)"
"Given that identification has a strong emotional component (eg, Cameron,_2004_CITE) we put forward the novel hypothesis that social factors are more influential than instrumental factors in fostering forum identification"
"A key aspect of our argument is that some of the benefits of online interaction may accrue particularly to people with stigmatizing conditions, whose need for a sense of community may be harder to meet in the course of normal, day-to-day offline interactions ( Goffman,_1963_CITE)"
"A stigmatizing condition is one that subjects its carrier to social devaluation ( Crocker,_Major,_&_Steele,_1998_CITE), and stigma is a psychological stressor for precisely this reason ( Allison,_1998;_Heckman_et_al.,_2002;_Varni,_Miller,_McCuin,_&_Solomon,_2012_CITE)"
"What stigma-related forums uniquely offer is that the anonymity protects those who are not ready to be publicly associated with sensitive topics; the community helps to neutralize the spoilage of identity that accompanies stigma ( Goffman,_1963_CITE)"
"We based our hypothesis on research showing that only people who initially lack offline support reap mental health benefits from online interaction ( Bessi re,_Kiesler,_Kraut,_&_Boneva,_2008_CITE) and that symptoms of depression are best ameliorated when sufferers not only show up to but actively engage with offline groups (eg, community recreation groups; Cruwys_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"This was based upon past research that has demonstrated first, that mental health illnesses are generally (and uncontentiously) recognized as stigmatised ( Schwenk,_Davis,_&_Wimsatt,_2010;_Wang,_Fick,_Adair,_&_Lai,_2007_CITE), and second, that certain environmental activities engaged in by small minorities (such as using non-disposable diapers) are considered to be rather marginalised and cranky with individuals choosing to engage in them receiving a rather negative reaction from the majority (at least in the UK; see Pendry_et_al.,_2012_CITE)."
"There is near-total (96%) market penetration for disposable nappies ( Aum nier,_Collins,_&_Garrett,_2008_CITE)"
"It is clear that negative stereotypes exist about non-disposable diaper users, who are already clearly a minority group in numerical terms ( Pendry_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"In her early work, Turkle_(eg,_1997)_CITE argued that the internet provided myriad positive opportunities for self-transformation, but more recently ( Turkle,_2012_CITE), she argues that the explosion in social media options has led us to develop superficial, emotionally lazy but instantly available virtual relationships as opposed to nurturing our real friends and family"
"Some online communication tools can actively support our interactions and relationships ( Kraut_et_al.,_2002_CITE)"
"This is especially true for forums covering more stigmatised issues where high levels of trust can develop, leading to a virtuous circle of caring which can greatly enhance users feelings of social cohesion and emotional intelligence ( Radin,_2006,_p._599_CITE)"
"This reflects the social cure idea ( Jetten,_Haslam,_&_Haslam,_2012_CITE) that identification is the key to many health outcomes"
"Our data echo recent research highlighting the key role that group identification can play in managing/reducing depressive symptoms ( Cruwys_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Since one of the hallmarks of stigmatising conditions such as depression is a tendency toward isolation and avoidance of social contact ( Cacioppo,_Hawkley,_&_Thisted,_2010;_Eberhart,_Auerbach,_Bigda-Peyton,_&_Abela,_2011;_Lumley_&_Harkness,_2007_CITE), encouraging individuals to sign up to and participate in face-to-face groups may not always be achievable"
"This is not always the case, at least for offline political action ( Boulianne,_2009_CITE)"
"For example, Byrne s_(2007)_CITE analysis of the BlackPlanet forum discussion threads suggested that while forum users debated the need for protest about black community issues, civic engagement rarely went beyond the discursive level"
"Past research (eg, Wojcieszak,_2009_CITE) indicates that links between internet use and offline civic/political activity are likely moderated by the feasibility of possible actions"
"Nonetheless, Jetten,_Haslam,_Haslam,_and_Branscombe_(2009)_CITE recently cautioned that virtual-world networking can become a substitute for real-world engagement (p"
"For example, Jenkins_(2006)_CITE coined the term participatory culture to encapsulate how online consumers do more than consume, they also create and influence"
"In direct contrast to Facebook groups, online forum interactions may provide a valuable source of advice and support while allowing people with stigmatizing conditions to remain at least initially anonymous as they lurk before contributing ( Davison,_Pennebaker,_&_Dickerson,_2000_CITE)"
"These qualities reduce users feeling of threat and allow them to develop a sense of identity and closeness to their like-minded virtual interaction partners ( Bargh_&_McKenna,_2004;_Bargh,_McKenna,_&_Fitzsimons,_2002_CITE)"
"In the rush to embrace social networking sites such as Facebook, both academics and the broader community are in danger of losing sight of these benefits, and indeed, forgetting they exist and may be of particular use for those who have social stigmas (see also Hurdley,_2013_CITE)"
"Second, users from the different forums self-selected to participate in the study, which limits the degree to which we can generalize our findings ( Bethlehem,_2008_CITE)"
"In the words of Radin_(2006_CITE, p_599 600), the forum formula succeeds in transforming many casual visitors into people who wholeheartedly contribute to the community by their very existence, [online forums] are planting the seeds of revolution."
"In the context of PC data, the inconsistency is the extent to which the set of the PC judgments are incoherent and when present can affect the accuracy of any derived weights vector [18]_CITE."
This segmentation of a larger decision problem can be achieved through the use of the Law of Comparative Judgment [32]_CITE
"Various numerical scales may be utilized to represent the strength of preference; the most widely utilized being the Saaty 1 9 scale [27]_CITE, where, for example, if element x is preferred 3 times more than element y, this can be denoted as x y with a preference strength of 3"
"Various other scales have been proposed of differing preference strength intervals, such as the Power scale [14]_CITE, the Geometric scale [20]_CITE, and the Logarithmic scale [17]_CITE"
Many PMs exist for this task; see [5]_CITE for a comprehensive discussion of PMs.
This may be achieved through Aggregation of Individual Priorities (AIP) [16]_CITE
"Alternatively, aggregation may be achieved through Aggregation of Individual Judgments (AIJ) [16]_CITE"
The Geometric Mean Method (GMM) [28]_CITE can be used to aggregate the PCMs of multiple DMs into a single aggregated PCM
The geometric mean should be utilized for AIJ as opposed to the arithmetic mean to ensure the reciprocal property of the judgments is preserved [2]_CITE
"Additionally, the GMM does not consider inconsistency during the aggregation process and it has been shown that the level of inconsistency can actually increase during the GMM aggregation process [31]_CITE"
The Weighted Arithmetic Mean Method (WAMM) [26]_CITE is utilized within AIP to aggregate separate DM weights vectors into a single aggregated weights vector
"When considering both the GMM and the WAMM, the most suitable mathematical aggregation generally depends on largely unknown information, such as for example, if the group is a synergistic unit or a collection of individuals [11]_CITE."
Highly inconsistent PCMs produce large errors and approximations from such matrixes make little practical sense [18]_CITE
Inconsistency within a PCM of more than a handful of elements has been shown to be almost inevitable [5]_CITE and therefore needs to be considered
The presence of 3-way cycles can be determined via an algorithm proposed in [19]_CITE
"The Consistency Ratio (CR), proposed by Saaty [27]_CITE, can be utilized to measure the level of cardinal inconsistency of a PCM"
"The ACI values represent the average inconsistency found over 50,000 trials of randomly generated matrices for each PCM order [27]_CITE"
Saaty further proposed an acceptability threshold value of a PCM CR value [27]_CITE
"A convergence algorithm approach was proposed in [33]_CITE that looks to find an altered PCM that has a cardinal inconsistency measure below a pre-defined threshold, whilst seeking to ensure the amount of departure from the original judgments is below given ranges"
Inconsistency reduction utilizing Evolutionary Computing (EC) has been reported in [8]_CITE
The approach in [31]_CITE looks to reduce ordinal inconsistency within a PCM via an iterative process that seeks to reverse judgments that will result in the maximum reduction of ordinal inconsistency to arrive at a solution without any ordinal inconsistency.
A method for reducing inconsistency within a PCM utilizing a MOO approach to model the trade-off between judgment modification and inconsistency reduction for a single DM was proposed in [1]_CITE
Building on [1]_CITE which was concerned with optimally reducing inconsistency for a single DM here we develop an approach to the problem of aggregation of PC judgments of a group of DMs.
"Evolutionary Computing (EC) techniques, such as Multi Objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGA) [6]_CITE, can be used to solve the above problem and generate a set of non-dominated solutions"
"MOGA, such as those proposed in [10,22,21]_CITE, seek to find a set of trade-off solutions, which are both as close to the true trade-off surface of the problem as possible and are as evenly spread along the trade-off front as possible"
"Ordinal inconsistency can be considered through employing the number of 3-way cycles ( L) as an inconsistency reduction objective [19]_CITE, looking to minimize the number of cycles within Aggregated Consensus Solutions"
Cardinal inconsistency can be considered through utilizing the Consistency Ratio (CR) [27]_CITE as an inconsistency reduction objective
"For example, to adhere to Saaty recommended CR < 0.1 threshold level of acceptability of inconsistency [27]_CITE, an upper limit constraint of 0.1 can be set upon a CR inconsistency reduction objective."
"For real-world decision making problems as well as seeking to find a set of trade-off solutions for problems with multiple conflicting objectives, additional consideration needs to be given to ultimately help a single solution to be selected [25]_CITE"
"Such approaches generally attach weights to the objectives before the search process, see [7]_CITE"
Moreover attempting to extract direct preference information first may be so consuming and complex that it is counterproductive to real world decisions [3]_CITE
"Interactive: Alternatively DM preferences can be incorporated progressively during the searching via interactive feedback such as in [24]_CITE, in which DM preferences are incorporated by presenting pairs of non-dominated solutions for discrimination between, and in [12]_CITE, where a utility function of DM preferences is utilized to help drive the search process into preferred areas of the trade-off front"
"For the examples presented later the Geometric Mean PM [9]_CITE (equivalent to the Logarithmic Least Squares (LLS) PM [9]_CITE) is utilized to derive weights vectors from aggregated consensus solutions, however any PM can be utilized"
"AHP, developed by Saaty [29]_CITE, makes extensive use of PCs utilized within a hierarchical framework defining the decision goal, its alternatives and the set of criteria for which the alternatives are to be compared by"
When AHP is utilized for group decision making the formulation of the decision elements may be defined by a single overseeing DM or via a more interactive approach between the DMs involved [29]_CITE
"The issue of heat conduction was addressed by other scientists as well, such as Fick, Maxwell, Einstein, Richards, Taylor [1]_CITE."
"Analytical solution for a fractional diffusion-wave equation or model (2) can be described by the following relation, which includes also the solution (1) and thus represents a more general form of analytical solution [31]_CITE (5)T(x, )= k=1 ckE -(nb)2 sinnx+1LT2-T1x+T1,where E (z) is the Mittag Leffler function, eg E1(-z)=e-z, resp"

"The primary technique used to solve the approximate fork-join queueing models is the Reversed Compound Agent Theorem (RCAT) ( Harrison,_2003_CITE), which provides a unified framework for the derivation of product-form solutions for cooperating Markovian processes by representing the cooperation as RCAT rate equations"
"We approximate the fork-join queueing system as a certain type of synchronizing product-form stochastic Petri nets called building blocks ( Balsamo_et al.,_2012_CITE) and derive the assumptions needed to accurately represent the performance measures of the fork-join queueing system"
"Automated direct solutions of the RCAT rate equations have not been attempted, as it has been deemed difficult due to the non-linearity of the equations ( Balsamo_et al.,_2010a_CITE)"
"At present, performance modelling has concentrated on traditional relational databases ( Osman_and_Knottenbelt,_2012_CITE), using mainly queueing networks, (eg Nicola_and_Jarke_(2000)_CITE; Elnikety_et al._(2009)_CITE; Di Sanzo_et al._(2010)_CITE; Osman_et al._(2011)_CITE) and queueing Petri nets, eg ( Osman_et al.,_2013;_Coulden_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"Recent work ( Osman_and_Piazzolla,_2014;_Gandini_et al.,_2014_CITE) in modelling NoSQL replication uses simulation based techniques to solve the models."

"Varki_(2001)_CITE, Varki_et al._(2013)_CITE calculate response time bounds for open and closed fork-join systems and extend Mean-Value Analysis (MVA) for such closed systems in Varki_(1999)_CITE."
Maximum order statistics are used to approximate the synchronization time of heterogeneous full fork systems in Lebrecht_and_Knottenbelt_(2007)_CITE; Harrison_and_Zertal_(2003)_CITE
Chen_(2001)_CITE applies a bubble sort analysis in combination with simulation to approximate an upper bound for the mean response time of an open full-fork homogeneous queueing system
A matrix geometric solution is applied to derive the upper and lower bounds of the performance measures of a heterogeneous full-fork open system in Balsamo_et al._(1998)_CITE and to calculate the moments of the mean queue lengths in Balsamo_and_Mura_(1997)_CITE
Casale_et al._(2008)_CITE apply a noniterative analysis technique to approximate the performance measures for a closed full-fork queueing system.
"For example, Varki_et al._(2012)_CITE calculate the pessimistic and optimistic bounds and approximation for the mean response time of a fork-join queue with dynamic forking"
Kumar_and_Shorey_(1993)_CITE calculate bounds on the mean response times for a fork-join system in which the number of forked jobs is random
The work in Alomari_and_Menasce_(2014)_CITE provides an MVA approximation for dynamic and full fork joins for a multi-class homogenous and heterogeneous open and closed fork-join queues
"Nelson_and_Tantawi_(1988)_CITE build on the work in Flatto_and_Hahn_(1984)_CITE to derive an approximate closed-form expression for the mean response time for a n-way fork-join system, 2 n 32, with homogenous servers"
The work in Thomasian_and_Menon_(1994)_CITE; 1997_CITE); Thomasian_(1997)_CITE present an approximation of mean response times for fork-join requests in RAID5 disk arrays in degraded mode in which interfering requests arrive at the n 1 surviving disks in addition to a (n 1)-full-fork request that is used to reconstruct the nth failed disk.
"RCAT refers to the structure used to analyse SPNs in product-form as building blocks (BBs) ( Balsamo_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"(Building Block (BB) ( Balsamo_et al.,_2012_CITE)) Given an ordinary (connected) SPN S with a set of transitions T and set of N places P"
"The sufficient conditions for the product-form of a BB is given in Theorem 1 ( Balsamo_et al.,_2012_CITE) and the throughput (reversed rate) of the output transition in Lemma 1 ( Balsamo_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"To simplify the calculation of the performance measures of the RB-n-m and avoid the calculation of the normalization constant, we follow the convention in Llad _and_Harrison_(2011)_CITE, Balsamo_et al._(2012)_CITE by considering each place Ni in the BB-n as an independent M/ M/1 queue"
"AutoCAT ( Casale_and_Harrison,_2013_CITE) formulates the RCAT sufficient conditions for product-form into a non-linear optimization problem with non-convex quadratic constraints"
"INAP ( Balsamo_et al.,_2010a;_Marin_and_Bulo,_2009_CITE) is a fixed point iterative technique to compute the stationary distributions of product-form models that satisfy MARCAT ( Harrison_and_Lee,_2005_CITE)"
"Comparing against an open model comprising a BB-2 and three queues (equivalent to 13 equations), our method provided a more efficient solution time of 0.09 s, with AutoCAT and INAP taking 35 and 234 seconds respectively ( Casale_and_Harrison,_2013_CITE)."
"In distributed NoSQL single-master datastores ( Cattell,_2011;_Stonebraker_and_Cattell,_2011_CITE), eg, Redis_(0000)_CITE, the client application is aware of the location of the replicated data within the datastore cluster"
"Furthermore, in practice, industry deployments of NoSQL datastores favor partial consistency in which the number of copies of data items replicated within the cluster is three or below ( Bailis_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"A product-form solution is possible as the RCAT theorem allows for the composition of BB-n and product-form constructs to form larger models ( Llad _and_Harrison,_2011;_Balsamo_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"In addition, RB-n-m models can be composed with other product-form constructs to form detailed models of network infrastructure, cloud storage and data center delays, as illustrated in ( Llad _and_Harrison,_2011_CITE)."
"The reversed rate for a transition from state i to state j with rate is ( Kelly,_1979_CITE): (16)r = (i) (j)where ( ) denotes the equilibrium probability function of the CTMC."
"The steps to apply RCAT are as follows ( Harrison,_2010_CITE): 1"
"Check that the RCAT enabling conditions ( Harrison,_2003_CITE) stated below are satisfied."
"The elegance of RCAT and its extensions ( Harrison,_2004;_Harrison_and_Lee,_2005_CITE), has been in providing a unified automated approach to deriving product-form solutions to a variety of known cooperating Markovian processes: ie, Jackson queueing networks ( Harrison,_2003_CITE), BCMP networks ( Harrison,_2004_CITE), G-networks with triggers ( Harrison_and_Marin,_2013_CITE) and stochastic Petri nets ( Balsamo_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"Moreover, Extended RCAT has produced new product-form solutions for G-networks with generalized resets ( Harrison,_2004_CITE), finite capacity queues with blocking or skipping ( Balsamo_et al.,_2010b_CITE) and stochastic Petri nets with signals ( Marin_et al.,_2012_CITE)."
"Algorithms to derive the rate equations for specific Markovian processes, eg, in Harrison_and_Marin_(2013)_CITE the authors describe a general algorithm to derive the rate equations for any set of cooperating Markovian processes specified in PEPA ( Hillston,_1994_CITE)"
"In Balsamo_et al._(2012)_CITE, an algorithm to identify the basic building blocks of a stochastic Petri net is described"
"A Business process can be defined as a set of one or more linked procedures or activities which collectively realise a business objective or policy goal, normally within the context of an organisational structure defining functional roles and relationships [32]_CITE"
"1 is the automation of a business process, in whole or part, during which documents, information or tasks are passed from one participant to another for action, according to a set of procedural rules [32]_CITE"
A workflow has two main stages [32]_CITE: Build-time stage this refers to the stage where workflow descriptions of the business process are defined or changed
"For any two organisations to proceed in business, they need to have compatible workflows and compatible means that there should be an agreed sequence of activities exchanging collaborative messages and information [6]_CITE"
The set of all interface activities in a workflow is called interface process [6]_CITE
"When two of more organisations do business together, the need for workflow collaboration across multiple organisations arises [5]_CITE"
"Considerable amount of effort is needed to ensure that workflows are compatible [7,23]_CITE and proceed into the execution stage."
"Recent research on workflow collaboration focuses on reconciling existing incompatible workflows [13,3]_CITE"
"In an alternative top-down approach, organisations meet, discuss and design collaborative processes and then implement them [5]_CITE"
"Another paradigm in the literature is automatic workflow generation, which is based on AI planning where a workflow is considered as a plan [2,10]_CITE"
"If every activity in a workflow is treated as a web service, a workflow represents a plan of web services to achieve the desired goal state from a given initial state [22]_CITE"
"Web services are self-contained units of application logic [29]_CITE, which can be can be discovered, connected to and executed over the internet"
Therefore workflow generation can be treated as a web services composition problem [10]_CITE
Executing the plan will result in the goal state [2]_CITE.
Domain ontology refers to the formal representation of the environment where planning takes place [2]_CITE
"A web service composition environment is primarily a collection of web services, so the domain ontology is in the form of web services descriptions [22]_CITE."
"The framework uses SHOP2 for planning because SHOP2 supports complex domains, extended goals and non-deterministic actions [21]_CITE"
"Furthermore, it is a highly efficient planning system and has a Web Ontology Language for Services (OWLS) type mechanism for representing atomic tasks and decomposing composite tasks into atomic tasks [27]_CITE"
"The similar mechanism of OWLS and SHOP2 to hierarchically decompose complex tasks into sub tasks makes it straightforward to map OWLS definitions directly into SHOP2 domain [27,33]_CITE and create workflows based on the translated domain."
SHOP2 is a substantially expressive planner [26]_CITE
The expressivity of SHOP2 is similar to Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) [27]_CITE
"In the context of semantic web services, PDDL is neither too restrictive nor too expressive and is considered as a viable compromise between expressivity and efficiency [20]_CITE"
This makes it possible to integrate existing knowledge bases on the semantic web into SHOP2 domain [26]_CITE.
Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) language is the most widely used standard to represent workflows [14]_CITE
It defines the notation and semantics of business processes [16]_CITE
"It is a workflow modelling language [16]_CITE and lacks the semantic precision required for automatic business process generation and execution [17]_CITE, and so we cannot use it as a notation for the proposed framework"
OWLS is a language for describing web services [18]_CITE
"In OWLS, each service is modelled as a process [27]_CITE"
This similar way of modelling makes it possible to translate OWLS web services descriptions to SHOP2 domain [27]_CITE.
Van-der-Aalst and Weske [31]_CITE applied a three step Public-to-Private approach to inter-organisational workflows
Krukkert [13]_CITE proposed a solution in the openXchange project
Chen [3]_CITE presented an approach for reconciling existing workflows to bring about compatibility
[4]_CITE presented a bottom-up cross organisational workflow enactment approach
"Sirin et al [25]_CITE created a semi-automatic web services composition system, which allows users to select from a list of web services at each step of composition"
"Later, Sirin et al [27]_CITE extended their semi-automatic web service composition system to a fully automatic system"
Okutan and Cicekli [15]_CITE proposed an event calculus based web service composition and execution (WSCE) system
[1]_CITE suggested a Pi-Calculus based approach to compose web services into cross organisational business processes
"Corre a da Silva et al [8]_CITE presented a lightweight, flexible and user-friendly platform for cross organisational workflow interactions"
"Problem Solving Methods (PSMs) [9]_CITE is another area that has a conceptual resemblance to web service composition, due to its focus on reusable domain-independent reasoning about ontologies [11]_CITE"
"It is assumed that the collaborating organisations follow OWLS ontology for services, as OWLS is the most widely used standard specification for adding semantics to web services [10]_CITE"
"It extends the translation algorithm put forward in [27]_CITE, to translate atomic processes with both outputs and post-conditions"
The translation algorithm described in Sirin et al [27]_CITE translates composite processes directly into SHOP2 methods as it looks at web service composition as finding an execution path for already defined composite processes
"As the system proposed by Sirin et al [27]_CITE targets the creation of workflows for a single organisation only, it has a single SHOP2 domain to begin with"
"This means there is an agreed sequence of activities that can ensure the achievement of the goals of every collaborating organisation, which is the definition of compatibility [34]_CITE."
"The existing execution mechanisms from literature enact automatically generated workflows for single organisations only, however they can handle adhoc processes that are outside the boundaries of the organisation in the workflows [1]_CITE."
"The collaboration among cross organisational activities is enabled by using sending and receiving activities, also known as interface activities [6]_CITE"
"It also decouples the collaborating organisations from each other completely at runtime, which is a desired quality [30,31]_CITE"
"Unlike the presented enactment mechanism, the mechanism proposed by Sirin et al [27]_CITE targets the enactment of a single workflow only, and it is not able to perform runtime collaboration among the workflows of multiple collaborating organisations."
This is a modification of the example presented by Chen [3]_CITE
SHOP2 does not follow a specific model of time [19]_CITE
"The time taken by the system to generate workflows is dependent on several factors, including: the number of collaborating organisations, the number of activities in the workflow of each collaborating organisation and the quality of the domain knowledge used for planning [22]_CITE"
"The order in which the methods are specified in the domain can influence the efficiency of SHOP2 [28,24]_CITE"
"A mismatch between SHOP2 and OWLS that exists is that the logic used for describing SHOP2 domain is differently expressive than OWL used for describing web services [26]_CITE ie while OWL assumes an open world, the SHOP2 has a closed world assumption"
"Similarly, SHOP2 assumes that the modelled domain must be correct which is not easy to ensure in the web domain [26]_CITE"
The integration of an OWL reasoner with SHOP2 will minimise these issues [26]_CITE
"Based on Avi ienis_et al._(2004)_CITE, we use the term failure in this paper to refer to the state of the component or system violating expected QoS levels."
"Online failure prediction ( Salfner_et al.,_2010_CITE) aims to foresee looming QoS problems at runtime before they manifest themselves"
"Accurate failure predictions are a prerequisite for preemptive maintenance actions, reducing the effect of problems or even completely preventing them from occurring ( Brun_et al.,_2015;_Calinescu_et al.,_2011;_Candea_et al.,_2004;_Li_and_Lan,_2006_CITE)."
"This causes a chain of errors up to the system boundary and results in a failure on the system level ( Avi ienis_et al.,_2004;_Cortellessa_and_Grassi,_2007;_Nygard,_2007;_Hiller_et al.,_2001;_Johansson_and_Suri,_2005_CITE)"
This concept of failure propagation follows the definition by Avi ienis_et al._(2004)_CITE
"The FPM employs Bayesian network theory ( Bishop,_2006_CITE) to represent the propagation paths of failures with corresponding probabilities"
"The results show that our approach can predict runtime failures with a higher prediction quality, with respect to standard evaluation metrics ( Salfner_et al.,_2010_CITE)."
"1 provides a high-level view on a typical distributed enterprise application system ( Fowler,_2002_CITE)"
"In this scenario, the root cause of the failure could be a memory leak in the BT2, which causes a chain of errors ( Nygard,_2007_CITE) that propagates to the end users."
"There are already a number of existing architectural modeling languages and model extraction mechanisms ( Lorenzoli_et al.,_2008;_Schmerl_et al.,_2006_CITE), eg, PCM ( Becker_et al.,_2009_CITE), Descartes ( Brosig_et al.,_2014_CITE), and SLAstic ( van_Hoorn,_2014_CITE)."
"The architectural model used as the source is the SLAstic model ( van_Hoorn,_2014_CITE) which contains information regarding the structure and behavior of the system, and can be automatically extracted from monitoring data"
"The FPM employs the formalism of Bayesian networks ( Bishop,_2006_CITE) which is a probabilistic directed acyclic graph that can represent random variables and their conditional dependencies"
"Since the memory consumption is time series data, we can, for instance, employ autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) ( Shumway_and_Stoffer,_2013_CITE) as a component failure prediction technique"
"Assuming that the input data is normally distributed, the prediction error is also normally distributed ( Montgomery_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"The 95% prediction interval covers the 1.96 area of the distribution ( Montgomery_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Hora is designed to utilize any other prediction method, such as other time series forecasting ( Amin_et al.,_2012a_CITE) or machine learning techniques ( Pitakrat_et al.,_2013;_2014b_CITE), as long as they can 1) predict the failure probability and 2) provide the expected time of the failure."
"This microservice-based application ( Newman,_2015_CITE) provides a web service where users can view, add, or delete RSS feeds."
"The workload driver is set up on a separate node and uses Apache JMeter ( Halili,_2008_CITE) to generate user requests"
"A service failure is defined as an event that occurs when the service deviates from the correct service ( Avi ienis_et al.,_2004_CITE)"
"The load average represents the number of tasks in the CPU queue over time and provides more information than the CPU utilization ( Walker,_2006_CITE)"
"A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve ( Fawcett,_2006_CITE) represents the quality of the prediction by relating (TPR) to FPRs for different prediction thresholds, as shown in Fig_9"
"The AUC is recommended to be used as a single-number metric for evaluating learning algorithms ( Bradley,_1997;_Huang_and_Ling,_2005_CITE)"
"This is because the prediction quality is reduced when the predictors consider more data from the past because the short-term variations are neglected by the moving average part of ARIMA ( Shumway_and_Stoffer,_2013_CITE)."
"For instance, Fronza_et al._(2013)_CITE, Liang_et al._(2007)_CITE and Salfner_and_Malek_(2007)_CITE employ machine learning techniques to analyze event logs and classify the system into healthy and failure states"
"Online prediction approaches aim at providing information regarding the near future state of the running system based on runtime observations ( Salfner_et al.,_2010_CITE)"
"In contrast, offline prediction approaches are not used to trigger runtime actions, but to focus on providing QoS measures to reason on system design and evolution decisions ( Cortellessa_et al.,_2011;_Musa,_1998_CITE)."
"Similar to our approach, Cavallo_et al._(2010)_CITE and Amin_et al._(2012a,_2012b)_CITE use ARIMA and GARCH models, respectively, to forecast response times and time between failures of web services"
"In contrast, other approaches use statistical analysis with adaptive thresholds ( Bovenzi_et al.,_2011_CITE), complex event processing ( Baldoni_et al.,_2012_CITE), rule-based classification ( Sahoo_et al.,_2003_CITE), linear regression and decision trees ( Alonso_et al.,_2009_CITE), support vector machine ( Liang_et al.,_2007;_Fronza_et al.,_2013_CITE), nearest neighbor methods ( Liang_et al.,_2007_CITE), Bayesian networks and submodels ( Guan_et al.,_2012;_Watanabe_et al.,_2012;_Fu_and_Xu,_2007_CITE), and hidden semi-Markov models ( Salfner_and_Malek,_2007_CITE)."
Bovenzi_et al._(2011)_CITE apply statistical analysis with adaptive threshold to predict threshold violation of performance metrics in complex software systems
"Michlmayr_et al._(2009)_CITE present a framework to predict SLA violations in web services, which combines the advantages of both client- and server-side QoS monitoring."
"For black-box failure prediction, Baldoni_et al._(2012)_CITE employ complex event processing and hidden Markov models to predict failures of a distributed system based on the sniffed network traffic"
"On the other hand, Williams_et al._(2007)_CITE monitor performance metrics including response time and predict failures using anomaly detection in combination with dispersion frame technique."
"Regarding failures in large-scale systems, Sahoo_et al._(2003)_CITE predict critical events in computer cluster by analyzing event logs using rule-based classification algorithms"
Zheng_et al._(2010)_CITE predict failures in Blue Gene/P supercomputers by analyzing the log messages and using genetic algorithms to create rules for the log patterns that precede the failures
"Liang_et al._(2007)_CITE predict failures based on the event log from Blue Gene/L using different machine learning techniques, ie, RIPPER, support vector machine, and nearest neighbor method"
Guan_et al._(2012)_CITE employ Bayesian submodels to detect anomalies in the performance metrics of cloud computing systems
Watanabe_et al._(2012)_CITE collect log files of a cloud data center and analyze the similarity between the records
"In our previous work ( Pitakrat_et al.,_2014a_CITE), we apply machine learning techniques to analyze the correlation of event log of HPC systems and use the model to predict failure events"
Fu_and_Xu_(2007)_CITE employ Bayesian networks to predict failure events in HPC systems
"For other types of systems, Salfner_and_Malek_(2007)_CITE propose an online failure prediction approach using hidden semi-Markov models"
Alonso_et al._(2009)_CITE predict web server crashes by monitoring the memory usage and applying linear regression and decision trees to predict the time to memory exhaustion
Fronza_et al._(2013)_CITE apply random indexing to log messages and use support vector machine to predict the patterns that can lead to software failures.
"The approaches in this category employ architecture-based system models annotated with specific quality evaluation models or scenarios ( Babar_and_Gorton,_2004;_Babar_et al.,_2004;_Grunske,_2007_CITE), eg, performance ( Balsamo_et al.,_2004;_Koziolek,_2010_CITE), reliability ( Goseva-Popstojanova_and_Trivedi,_2001_CITE), and safety ( Grunske_and_Han,_2008_CITE) attributes"
Cortellessa_and_Grassi_(2007)_CITE present an approach for reliability analysis of component-based software systems
Becker_et al._(2009)_CITE introduce the Palladio Component Model (PCM) which enables performance prediction of component-based software systems
Brosch_et al._(2012)_CITE extend the PCM by annotating the components with corresponding reliability attributes
"As one recent example for performance, Brosig_et al._(2014)_CITE employ an architecture-based performance model to predict system performance at runtime for capacity planning and online resource provisioning"
"The performance characteristics are captured in an architectural performance model which is then solved by transforming it to an analytical model or by simulation, similar to Becker_et al._(2009)_CITE"
Chalermarrewong_et al._(2012)_CITE predict system unavailability in data centers using a set of component predictors and fault tree analysis
"For instance, emerging software engineering paradigms, such as DevOps ( Bass_et al.,_2015_CITE), aim for faster release cycles and rely on dynamic cloud environments"
"The structures and behaviors of these systems change frequently which requires continuous relearning of the failure models in order to retain the prediction quality ( Irrera_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
de_Barros_Barreto_et al._(2013)_CITE introduce a well-understood modeling technique and use BPMN models to acquire knowledge
Buckshaw_et al._(2005)_CITE propose a quantitative risk management by involving various experts and present a score-based assessment based on individual values and a standardization using a weighted sum
"However Jakobson_(2011)_CITE uses self-defined metrics for propagating impacts through Boolean gates, which cannot provide context- and bias-free understandable results or parametrization"
Musman_et al._(2011)_CITE proposes the use of BPMN models and describes a process for evaluating impacts of cyber-attacks
"Another ontology-based approach is presented by Amico_et al._(2010)_CITE, which identifies multiple experts while noting that, eg, system administrators are not capable of understanding an organization's missions."
"In terms of (probabilistic) approaches toward assessments of impacts caused by vulnerabilities and attacks, probabilistic models have been researched by Wang_et al._(2008),_Liu_and_Man_(2005)_CITE, or Xie_et al._(2010)_CITE"
Chung_et al._(2013)_CITE consider a probabilistic approach as well to determine the likelihoods of explicit attack paths
"This feature allows Bayesian networks to be a direct representation of the world, as stated by Pearl_and_Russell_(2003)_CITE"
We deeply discuss and propose a solution to the semantic normalization and merging problem of mission dependency models in Motzek_et al._(2016)_CITE.
"An implementation of this heuristic in an ICT use case is directly provided by, eg, Wireshark ( Combs,_2016_CITE )"
"In fact, examples like StuxNet (see, eg Langner,_2013_CITE) have shown that actual attack paths are only loosely based on an interaction of vulnerabilities, and that vulnerabilities rather represent first stages of attacks"
"Calculating iP(wiMN), ie, an exact solution to the MIA problem, is also known as the probabilistic satisfaction problem and is also used in the Problog reasoning framework ( Raedt_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
"In 2011 Sommestad_and_Hunstad_(2013)_CITE conducted an experiment at the information warfare lab of the Swedish defense research agency, which gives us the opportunity to demonstrate Example 4 for vulnerability impact assessment"
"The Panoptesec integrated research project aims to deliver a beyond-state-of-the-art prototype of a cyber defence decision support system ( Panoptesec_DOW,_2013_CITE)"
"We are able to apply and test the complete approach in the Panoptesec's use case partner, Acea SpA, Italy's largest water services operator and one of the largest energy distribution companies in Italy ( The_Acea_Group,_2016_CITE)"
We deeply discuss these challenges of an eminent semantic normalization and merging problem of mission dependency models in Motzek_et al._(2016)_CITE
In our work by Granadillo_et al._(2016)_CITE we demonstrate an approach to unify these three-dimensional assessments with further multi-dimensional assessments of response plans and propose a selection of optimal response plans based on an unweighted best compromise in all dimensions
In Granadillo_et al._(2016)_CITE we evaluate the suitability of the presented mission impact assessment for operational impact assessment to obtain adequate responses to cyber-attacks in the here-discussed ARETi environment
We discuss and evaluate the benefits of a combination of both toward a well-defined probabilistic mission defense and assurance approach in Motzek_and_M ller_(2016)_CITE
"An aggregation significantly can reduce computational costs for obtaining inference results in DPGMs, but requires a careful consideration of indirect influences as Motzek_and_M ller_(2015a)_CITE has shown"
"Then, in fact, the presented DMIA model represents a so-called activator dynamic Bayesian network (ADBN) Motzek_and_M ller_(2015a,_2015b)_CITE and one obtains well-defined semantics"
"One has to differentiate between induced observations and true observations; a differentiation related to Pearl's ( Pearl,_2002_CITE) introduction on the do-calculus and is best explained at an example: Considering an infectious-disease monitoring system, one has to differentiate between a person being healthy, because he has been healed and between a person being tested to be healthy"
"Boutilier_et al._1996_CITE) of Xt on all its possible dependencies Z , given +set, Xt is decoupled from all other potential sources of (non-)impact, and the observation xt is completely accredited to SEt"
"Several online [7,5,3,4]_CITE and one offline solution [2]_CITE have been proposed for order-preserving matching"
Kubica et al [4]_CITE and Kim et al [3]_CITE presented solutions based on the Knuth Morris Pratt algorithm (KMP) [8]_CITE
"Later, Cho et al [5,6]_CITE gave a sublinear solution based on the bad character heuristic of the Boyer Moore algorithm [9]_CITE"
"Almost at the same time, Belazzougui et al [7]_CITE derived an optimal sublinear solution"
"In the first KMP approach presented by Kubica et al [4]_CITE, the fail function in the KMP algorithm is modified to compute the order-borders table"
The second KMP approach by Kim et al [3]_CITE is based on the prefix representation
"The BMH approach by Cho et al [5]_CITE is based on the bad character rule applied to q-grams, ie strings of q characters"
"Later, Cho et al [6]_CITE introduced a linear version, which has been combined with KMP in order to guarantee linear behavior in the worst case."
"Two of them, SBNDM2 and SBNDM4 [10]_CITE are based on the Backward Nondeterministic DAWG Matching (BNDM) algorithm [1]_CITE"
"In BNDM, each alignment window is processed from right to left like in the Boyer Moore algorithm [9]_CITE by simulating the nondeterministic automaton of the reversed pattern with bitparallelism"
The third algorithm is Fast Shift-Or (FSO) [11]_CITE
FSO was selected because it is fast on short binary patterns [10]_CITE
"The fourth algorithm is the KMP algorithm [8]_CITE; together with verification it was supposed to approximate the two earlier methods [3,4]_CITE based on KMP"
"In Table 1, S2OPM represents the algorithm based on SBNDM2 filtration, S4OPM represents the algorithm based on SBNDM4 filtration, BMOPM- q represents the BMH approach [5]_CITE for q=3,4,5, KOPM represents the algorithm based on KMP filtration and FSO-OPM represents the algorithm based on Fast Shift-Or."
"After submitting this paper, Chhabra et al [13]_CITE improved filtering time with the SIMD technology"
Chhabra et al [14]_CITE applied the same encoding to approximate order-preserving matching
"As long as the system is given by time-invariant dynamics, linearization at the operating point gives local stability information that can be extended through incorporating some nonlinear features, eg, via the use of normal forms, see [1]_CITE"
"In this paper we discuss the latter situation since macroscopic perturbations in engineering systems generally are non-white; but a similar theory also holds for the white noise case, see [4]_CITE for the basics"
"We assume that (2) has a unique stationary, ergodic solution (t, ) which is guaranteed by the condition (compare [5]_CITE) (3)dimLA{X1, ,Xr}( )=dimMfor all M.Here LA{ } denotes the Lie algebra generated by a set of vector fields"
"Exponential stability of the system (1) is described by Lyapunov exponents; in [6]_CITE we gave an overview of the almost sure theory, with applications to power systems"
"Then, by [5]_CITE, Condition (7) is equivalent to dimI( ,s)=dimM+d-1"
"This condition, which is needed for the analysis of moment Lyapunov exponents, is slightly stronger than Condition 7 in [6]_CITE, but it is generally satisfied for systems that appear in applications, compare, eg, [5]_CITE or [10]_CITE"
With the results from Theorem 2.1 it was shown by Arnold in [7]_CITE that the a.s
"Such a point a does not always exist since g(p)= p is possible, compare [9]_CITE, Theorem 2.3, Case 2.1.2(a)"
"More precisely, + is given by the exponential growth rate of the spectral radius of the (deterministic) semigroup given by (1), see also [13]_CITE, Chapter 7"
"For these reasons, the point a>0 is called the stability index of a linear stochastic system in [8]_CITE"
"In [8,14]_CITE the authors investigate the robustness of the stability index under small nonlinear model misspecifications"
"The almost sure stability radius (11)r=inf{ 0, ( )>0}was introduced in [12]_CITE and analyzed in detail in [3]_CITE"
"Lyapunov exponents has attracted great interest (see, eg, [6,11,16]_CITE, or [17]_CITE and the references therein), the computation of moment Lyapunov exponents seems relatively unexplored"
"One way is to write g(p) as the maximal eigenvalue of a certain second order partial differential operator (see, eg, [7]_CITE for the white noise, and [9]_CITE for the general case)"
"This idea has been followed, eg, in [21]_CITE, in some examples of Chapter 9 in [20]_CITE, or in [18]_CITE, but generalizations to high dimensional systems appear more than cumbersome"
"The other approach is to follow the definition (5), ie, simulate trajectories of the system (1), compute the moments and their exponential growth rate, see eg, [19]_CITE or [20]_CITE, Chapter 9.2 for an idea in this direction"
"Our experiences from [6]_CITE suggest to simulate solutions directly from the linear differential equation, using renormalization at regular time intervals since the trajectories grow or decay exponentially"
"Of course, burn-in intervals and choice of initial values have to be considered carefully, see [6]_CITE for a discussion of these issues for a.s"
"The stochastic perturbation is (t)= sin( (t)), where (t, ) is an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process as in [6]_CITE and 0 is the size of perturbation"
exponent ( ) using the methodology described in [6]_CITE
"The state vector for the linearized system x =Ax, is x=[ , , fd,v1,v2,v3]where v1,v2,v3 are variables of the power system stabilizer, using expressions defined in [15]_CITE"
The stochastic perturbation is t= sin( t) with t an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process as in [6]_CITE and is the size of perturbation
"In the similar case of Example 4.1, the key parameter in this system is the gain of the PSS, KPSS, whose nominal value KPSSnom was chosen as in [15]_CITE"
"These indices are based on moment Lyapunov exponents and they complement the almost sure Lyapunov exponent and stability radius analyzed in [6,2]_CITE"
"1 or by the rich semantic content of moving point abstractions of real-world events and everyday interaction scenes (eg reading gender from gait, [21]_CITE)"
"Furthermore, such spatial interactions between agents carry invaluable information not only to human observers, but increasingly also to electronic sensing systems, for example those overlooking or assisting with crowd flows [32]_CITE, or traffic management [5]_CITE"
"A number of variants of QTC have been proposed in the past, including versions enabling the application of QTC to networks [8]_CITE, and shapes [31]_CITE"
Our representation is based on qualitative descriptions of transformations of the Frenet Serret frames [17]_CITE accompanying the trajectories of the moving objects
"Qualitative temporal and spatial reasoning about movement behavior has increasingly gained momentum over the last two decades, as scholars have begun to recognize the importance of qualitative reasoning in describing the common-sense background knowledge on which our human perspective on physical movements is based [11,12]_CITE"
"In particular, various qualitative temporal calculi, such as the Interval Calculus [2]_CITE and the Semi Interval Calculus [10]_CITE, have been proposed"
"Along this line, a well-matured body of research has been developed regarding mereotopological relationships, as exemplified by the RCC-calculus [25]_CITE and the 9-intersection model [9]_CITE."
"As with other qualitative calculi, the theoretical framework of QTC has been thoroughly investigated by, among others, composition-tables [28]_CITE and conceptual neighborhood diagrams [29]_CITE"
"This has been furthered by an implementation of QTC that is capable of describing real-world movements, both at time stamps (by QTC relations) and during longer periods (by QTC animations, being a sequence of QTC relations) [7]_CITE"
"Such animations can represent all kinds of real-world interactions, including an overtake event [27]_CITE and prey predator interactions [30]_CITE."
"In the preliminary work of Bellotto [3]_CITE, a version of QTC dealing only with the linear distance between two agents (ie QTC Basic = QTC B) was adopted to describe and implement simple spatial interactions, in which a robot and a human approached or moved away from each other"
"In Hanheide et al [13]_CITE, the human trajectory induced by a particular robot motion behavior in narrow spaces was analyzed using sequences of QTC states that included also lateral movements (ie QTC Double Cross = QTC C)"
"Combinations of QTC B and QTC C sequences were then exploited in Bellotto et al [4]_CITE to design and implement human robot spatial interactions with varying degrees of resolution, depending on the scenario and the desired robot behavior"
Some previous work has considered qualitative spatial representations and reasoning on 3D regions [1]_CITE
"Also, an attempt has been made on the orientation of point objects, but only with respect to external reference systems [23,24]_CITE"
Let us start by providing a brief summary of the essentials of the traditional two-dimensional Qualitative Trajectory Calculus [26]_CITE
An example of hand-crafted controller informed by QTC analysis and applied to Human Robot Spatial Interaction can be found in Bellotto et al [4]_CITE
"For the automated solution of the more general problem, which is the generation of prototypical trajectories of two objects satisfying a given QTC sequence, one needs a solution to the so-called Inverse QTC problem , which was for the first time provided in Iliopoulos et al [16]_CITE"
"Group dance movements, for example, contain intricate yet often highly structured patterns of motion; QTC could be used not only towards analysis of human relative trajectories as moving point objects, but also by placing moving point objects at important human body points, and then describing the relative motions within a dancer body or across dancer body points [6]_CITE"
"Calculate the component vectors of the two Frenet Serret frames, ie the tangents, normals, and binormals, according to the following equations [20]_CITE: (I)t1( )=ds1/d /|ds1/d |t2( )=ds2/d /|ds2/d | (II)n1( )=dt1/d /|dt1/d |n2( )=dt2/d /|dt2/d | (III)b1( )=t1( ) n1( )b2( )=t2( ) n2( )"
"Performing the roll, pitch, and yaw rotations (in that order), would yield the following matrix [18]_CITE, which corresponds to our transformation T: (VII)R , , =cos cos cos sin sin -sin cos cos sin cos +sin sin sin cos sin sin sin +cos cos sin sin cos -cos sin -sin cos sin cos cos"
"New communication technologies such as social media have made social news more pervasive ( Bazarova,_2012_CITE)"
"Facebook continuously keeps users updated with a variety of posts, and passive consumption of news updates is the main Facebook activity that people engage in ( Wise,_Alhabash,_&_Park,_2010_CITE)"
"The majority of these updates are positive ( Barash,_Ducheneaur,_Isaacs,_&_Bellotti,_2010;_Utz,_2015_CITE)"
"There is evidence for emotional contagion, showing happiness can spread through the news updates on online social networks ( Coviello_et_al.,_2014;_Kramer,_Guillory,_&_Hancock,_2014_CITE)"
"However, recent studies also indicate that exposure to positive posts on Facebook may induce envy and lead to depression ( Steers,_Wickham,_&_Acitelli,_2014;_Tandoc,_Ferrucci,_&_Duffy,_2014_CITE) and reduced well-being over time ( Kross_et_al.,_2013;_Verduyn_et_al.,_2015_CITE)"
"Given that Facebook has over 1.35 billion active users ( Facebook,_2014_CITE) and there are on average 1500 potential stories for users to check per visit ( Facebook,_2013_CITE), we are eager to understand how Facebook affects users emotions and identify relevant factors that will determine emotional reactions"
"From a long-term perspective, the use of social media offers benefits such as the possibility of developing and maintaining social capital and social connectedness ( Ellison,_Steinfield,_&_Lampe,_2007;_Grieve,_Indian,_Witteveen,_Anne_Tolan,_&_Marrington,_2013;_Sheldon,_Abad,_&_Hinsch,_2011_CITE); Nevertheless, it may also lead to negative outcomes such as social overload ( Maier,_Laumer,_Eckhardt,_&_Weitzel,_2012_CITE), an over-optimistic perception towards others lives ( Chou_&_Edge,_2012_CITE), and a decrease in life satisfaction ( Kross_et_al.,_2013_CITE)"
"From a short-term perspective, the use of Facebook can evoke a feeling of flow, which is characterized by high positive valence and high arousal ( Mauri,_Cipresso,_Balgera,_Villamira,_&_Riva,_2011_CITE), and joyful and fun are the most common positive feelings reported by users while using Facebook ( Krasnova,_Wenninger,_Widjaja,_&_Buxmann,_2013_CITE)"
"Nonetheless, the consumption of social news on Facebook can also trigger invidious emotions such as jealousy and envy ( Krasnova_et_al.,_2013;_Muise,_Christofides,_&_Desmarais,_2009;_Tandoc_et_al.,_2014_CITE)."
"Previous research has revealed that the more time individuals spent browsing Facebook, the more negative their mood was immediately afterwards, and this was mediated by a feeling of not having done anything meaningful ( Sagioglou_&_Greitemeyer,_2014_CITE)"
"Users may experience the feelings of exhaustion and information overload when they are continuously browsing social news ( Maier_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"Also, being exposed to social news on Facebook can evoke feelings of envy ( Krasnova_et_al.,_2013_CITE)"
"However, when it comes to momentary experiences, users often feel pleasant and positively aroused when browsing Facebook ( Mauri_et_al.,_2011;_Wise_et_al.,_2010_CITE)."
"In an exploratory study ( Krasnova_et_al.,_2013_CITE), participants were asked to report their overall feelings after their most recent Facebook usage: 43.8% of the respondents reported at least one positive emotional outcome (such as feeling joyful/fun, satisfied, informed, excited, and relaxed), and 36.8% of the respondents reported at least one negative emotional outcome (such as feeling bored, angry, frustrated, guilty, tired, sad, lonely, and envious)"
"In a social network context, relationship closeness is often intertwined with the expression of tie strength ( Gilbert,_2012_CITE): A strong tie is usually a close friend or family member, that with whom one shares an intimate relationship; and a weak tie is usually an acquaintance that one does not feel emotionally close to"
"As tie strength can also be measured by relationship closeness ( Marsden_&_Campbell,_1984_CITE), in this paper, we treat tie strength and relationship closeness as interchangeable."
"Facebook users often post about their positive life events, successes, and entertaining status updates ( Utz,_2011,_2015_CITE), and sometimes even present themselves in overly flatting ways ( Barash_et_al.,_2010;_Mehdizadeh,_2010;_Qiu,_Lin,_Leung,_&_Tov,_2012_CITE)"
"The feeling of happiness can be explained by the effects of emotional contagion ( Cheshin,_Rafaeli,_&_Bos,_2011;_Hatfield,_Cacioppo,_&_Rapson,_1993_CITE), ie, the tendency for two individuals to emotionally converge; whereas the feeling of envy can be explained as a result of upward social comparison ( Festinger,_1954_CITE)."
"Humans, as a species that are embedded in complex social networks, rely on the ability of sharing others emotions (empathy) to engage in successful social interactions ( Norscia_&_Palagi,_2011;_Preston_&_de_Waal,_2002_CITE)"
"The ability to catch or experience other feelings leads to the phenomenon of emotional contagion , which has been described as the tendency to automatically mimic and synchronize expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movements with those of another person s, and, consequently, to converge emotionally ( Hatfield_et_al.,_1993_CITE)"
"Recent studies found that emotions such as happiness can be transferred from one person to another not only in face-to-face communication ( Hancock,_Gee,_Ciaccio,_&_Lin,_2008;_Hatfield_et_al.,_1993;_Neumann_&_Strack,_2000_CITE), but also in computer-mediated-communication ( Cheshin_et_al.,_2011;_Coviello_et_al.,_2014;_Kramer,_2012_CITE)"
"Previous research (in offline settings) demonstrates that empathy is more pronounced when the relationship between two individuals within a dyad is closer ( Beeney,_Franklin,_Levy,_&_Adams,_2011;_Norscia_&_Palagi,_2011;_Preston_&_de_Waal,_2002_CITE)"
"And thus, the ability to empathize with close others would have facilitated social interactions ( Norscia_&_Palagi,_2011_CITE)"
"In addition, based on the Perception Action Model for empathy, individuals with higher similarity and familiarity are more likely to catch emotions from each other ( Preston_&_de_Waal,_2002_CITE)"
"Envy, a pain caused by the good fortune of others, is another potential emotional outcome of encountering positive news on Facebook ( Krasnova_et_al.,_2013_CITE), and it might be a reason why browsing Facebook can lead to depression ( Tandoc_et_al.,_2014;_Verduyn_et_al.,_2015_CITE)"
"The concept of envy is often confused with jealousy, but clear differences exist: Jealousy arises when one has something but is afraid of losing it or has lost it to another person, while envy arises when another person has something that one does not have ( Parrott_&_Smith,_1993_CITE)"
"Recent literature on envy further established two different types of envy: benign envy and malicious envy ( Smith_&_Kim,_2007;_Van_de_Ven,_Zeelenberg,_&_Pieters,_2009_CITE)"
"Envy generally arises from engaging in upward comparison(s) ( Nabi_&_Keblusek,_2014;_Van_de_Ven,_Zeelenberg,_&_Pieters,_2012_CITE), ie, when people compare themselves with better-off others ( Mussweiler,_R ter,_&_Epstude,_2004_CITE)"
"In Festinger s_(1954)_CITE classic theory of social comparison, he claimed that people have a desire to know about their own opinions and abilities, and when the reference to the physical world is not clear, people tend to compare themselves to others"
"In essence, he suggested that people select comparison standards that are similar to themselves on the critical dimension, in order to get diagnostic information for self-evaluation ( Festinger,_1954_CITE)"
"Similarly, Smith_(2004)_CITE proposed four pre-conditions for envy: being similar to the compared person, perceiving the situation as self-relevant, the desired object is hard to achieve (or low perceived control), and the feeling that the person does not deserve the object (or one own inferior situation is perceived to be undeserved)"
"The latter two factors were found to be the key appraisals that distinguished benign from malicious envy: The more a situation was perceived as fair and controllable, the more benign envy rather than malicious envy was experienced, while malicious envy was experienced when the situation was appraised as undeserved for the compared person ( Van_de_Ven_et_al.,_2012_CITE)."
"Tesser_(1988)_CITE argued in his Self-Evaluation Maintenance theory (SEM) that an upward comparison is most threatening when the superior other is psychologically close, and social comparisons to strong ties may be a double-edged sword"
"As indicated by Tesser s_(1988)_CITE theory, the effect of tie strength on feeling of envy is further moderated by the compared domain"
"We also measured the respondents self-esteem with 6 items adapted from Rosenberg s_(1965)_CITE scale (Cronbach = 0.91), in addition to demographic information."
"As the positive emotions outweigh the negative emotions, browsing Facebook at least on a message level (for a relatively short amount of time) is not as psychologically harmful as described in certain research (eg, Konnikova,_2013,_September_10_CITE)"
"This phenomenon was recently described as cost of caring in the context of Facebook ( Hampton,_Rainie,_Lu,_Shin,_&_Purcell,_2015_CITE)"
"These types of positive posts can lead to upward comparisons and envy ( Krasnova_et_al.,_2013_CITE)"
"In addition, most of the posts on Facebook are quite positive and entertaining, as a result of impression management motives and privacy concerns ( Barash_et_al.,_2010;_Utz,_2015_CITE)."
"Research has shown that benign envy is an uplifting type of envy: people want to be closer to the comparison other, regardless of the feeling of frustration ( Van_de_Ven_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"In addition, Mussweiler_et_al._(2004)_CITE claimed that assimilation, ie, the self is assimilated toward a given standard, is more likely if the target and the comparison other share a close relationship"
"s_(2004)_CITE concept of assimilation, we assume that a close and intimate relationship between the reader and poster helps to develop good will and the motivation of levelling-up; therefore, benign envy is more likely to happen when an envy-inducing post is posted by a strong tie rather than a weak tie"
"As suggested by Tesser s_(1988)_CITE theory, individuals may do things, such as pulling down other performance, in order to reduce the decrease in self-evaluation"
"When the compared domain is not central to one self-definition, the reflection process is more important than the comparison process ( Tesser,_1988_CITE)"
"Although envy is a common emotion felt by most people, there are important individual differences in the tendency to feel it ( Smith,_Parrott,_Diener,_Hoyle,_&_Kim,_1999_CITE)"
"As described earlier, four preconditions are relevant: perceived similarity, self-relevant, perceived control, and perceived deservedness/unfairness ( Smith,_2004_CITE)"
"We included the third group of middle ties in order to create a continuum connecting the two ends, strong and weak ties, as proposed by Huszti,_D vid,_and_Vajda_(2013)_CITE"
These items were adapted from the scales used in Crusius_and_Lange s_(2014)_CITE study
"Furthermore, dispositional envy was measured with an 8-item scale (Cronbach = 0.85) developed by Smith_et_al._(1999)_CITE and dispositional happiness was measured with a 6-item scale (Cronbach = .88) developed by Shiota,_Keltner,_and_John_(2006)_CITE"
Krasnova_et_al._(2013)_CITE inferred that the invidious feeling of envy on social networking sites can lead to a decrease in users life satisfaction
"Malicious envy is more likely to emerge when the envied object was perceived as undeserved ( Van_de_Ven_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"Also, based on Tesser s_(1988)_CITE SEM model, there should be an interaction effect between relationship closeness and domain-relevance on envy"
"Further, while individuals might experience envy towards their close friend, it may be less detrimental as once expected (eg, Krasnova_et_al.,_2013_CITE) since benign envy generally motivates individuals to self-improve."
"Because most Facebook users cannot read all the potential stories from their Facebook friends and pages, a News Feed ranking algorithm was created, adjusting the sequence of posts rather than using the chronological order ( Facebook,_2013_CITE)"
"However, it is still technically difficult to determine what kinds of stories are relatively important for individual users and what kinds of posts can make users happier, rather than triggering negative feelings such as envy (as described in Chou_&_Edge,_2012_CITE)"
"The underground mines can be divided into two major areas [4]_CITE: (a) the open area consisting of a room and pillars ( Fig_1 a) is where the extraction activities take place, (b) the tunnels include the passageways and shafts [5]_CITE and are used for cut-and-fill mining ( Fig_1b) and long-wall mining ( Fig_1c)."

Asif and colleagues [7]_CITE used ray tracing technique for modeling an Ultra Wide Band indoor channel
"Ndoh and Delisle [8]_CITE showed that using the reflection from the rough sidewalls, and diffraction and scattering of the signal from corners and obstacles the ray tracing technique allows estimation of the received signal in a mobile system."
Emslie et al [9]_CITE provided the first comprehensive theoretical study of propagation characteristics in underground mines
Sun et al [10]_CITE used a multimode model to analytically characterize the natural wave propagation in mines
The main challenge in characterizing wireless channels in confined areas of a mine is the randomized multipath propagation phenomena [11]_CITE
"The average error probability in the presence of fading is obtained by averaging the conditional error probability over one of the selected fading PDF [15]_CITE: (9)pe= 0 pex f d ,where pe( x| y) is the conditional probability of bit error given by instantaneous SNR ( ) and f( ) is the PDF of a particular fading channel."
"The probability of bit error over Rayleigh fading channel for DBPSK can be expressed as [14]_CITE: (10)pe_DBPSK+Ray=12 (1+ ) .Similarly, the probability of bit error in Rician fading channel for DBPSK can be expressed as: (11)pe_DBPSK+Ric=1+K2 (1+K+ )exp-K 1+K+ ."
"There are multiple relevant reviews concerning the psychology of spatial cognition ( Allen,_2003;_Tommasi_&_Laeng,_2012_CITE) as well as its underlying neuroscience ( Avraamides_&_Kelly,_2008;_Burgess,_2008;_Moser,_Kropff,_&_Moser,_2008;_Tommasi,_Chiandetti,_Pecchia,_Sovrano,_&_Vallortigara,_2012_CITE)"
"Although some of these reviews also mention the occasional computational model, no systematic review of computational models of spatial memory has been published in the last decade (note that Trullier,_Wiener,_Berthoz,_&_Meyer,_1997_CITE have reviewed biologically based artificial navigation systems, and Mark,_Freksa,_Hirtle,_Lloyd,_&_Tversky,_1999_CITE published a review of models of geographical space)"
"In addition to navigation space the space of potential travel other forms of spatial representation have also been considered in the literature (eg representations of the positions of body parts or external representations such as maps or diagrams Tversky,_2005_CITE)."
"Computational models attempt to formally describe a part (or parts) of cognition in a simplified fashion, allowing their simulation on computers ( McClelland,_2009;_Sun,_2008b_CITE), and providing more detail, precision, and possibly more clarity than qualitative descriptions"
"In addition, computational models might facilitate the understanding and clarification of the implications of a theory or idea, in ways that would be difficult for humans without simulation on computers ( McClelland,_2009_CITE)"
"The predictions can subsequently be tested or verified using data obtained from empirical experiments with humans or animals, and comparing this data with the model predictions (usually employing some statistical measure of model fit; Pitt,_Myung,_&_Zhang,_2002_CITE)."
"Frequently employed qualitative criteria include explanatory adequacy, interpretability, and biological plausibility or realism ( Cassimatis,_Bello,_&_Langley,_2008;_Myung,_Pitt,_&_Kim,_2005_CITE)."
"Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) show increased firing at multiple locations, regularly positioned in a grid across the environment consisting of equilateral triangles ( Hafting,_Fyhn,_Molden,_Moser,_&_Moser,_2005_CITE)"
"since their activation is updated depending on the animal movement speed and direction ( Burgess,_2008;_Hafting_et al.,_2005;_McNaughton,_Battaglia,_Jensen,_Moser,_&_Moser,_2006_CITE)"
"There is evidence to suggest that grid cells exist not only in mammals, but also in the human entorhinal cortex (EC) ( Doeller,_Barry,_&_Burgess,_2011_CITE)"
"The primary circuit responsible for head direction signals projects from the dorsal tegmental nucleus to the lateral mammillary nucleus, anterior thalamus and postsubiculum, terminating in the entorhinal cortex ( Taube,_2007_CITE)"
"There is evidence that head direction cells exist in the human brain within the medial parietal cortex ( Baumann_&_Mattingley,_2010_CITE)."
"The former ( Lever,_Burton,_Jeewajee,_O Keefe,_&_Burgess,_2009;_Solstad,_Boccara,_Kropff,_Moser,_&_Moser,_2008_CITE) seem to fire in proximity to environment boundaries, whereas the firing of the latter ( Barry_et al.,_2006;_Burgess,_2008_CITE) depends on boundary proximity as well as direction relative to the mammal head"
"Cells with these properties have been found in the mammalian subiculum and entorhinal cortex ( Lever_et al.,_2009;_Solstad_et al.,_2008_CITE), and there is also some behavioral evidence substantiating their existence in humans ( Barry_et al.,_2006_CITE)."
"Place cells are pyramidal cells in the hippocampus which exhibit strongly increased firing when the animal is in specific spatial locations, largely independent from orientation in open environments ( Burgess,_2008;_O Keefe_&_Dostrovsky,_1971_CITE), thus providing a representation of an animal (or human Ekstrom_et al.,_2003_CITE) location in the environment"
"A possible explanation for the formation of place cell firing fields is that they emerge from a combination of grid cell inputs on different scales ( Moser_et al.,_2008;_Solstad,_Moser,_&_Einevoll,_2006_CITE)"
"It has also been proposed that place fields might be mainly driven by environmental geometry, arising from a sum of boundary vector cell inputs ( Barry_et al.,_2006;_Hartley,_Burgess,_Lever,_Cacucci,_&_O Keefe,_2000_CITE); or by a combination of grid cell and boundary vector cell inputs ( Madl_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Apart from information about the current spatial location, hippocampal place cells also participate in place object associations ( Kim,_Delcasso,_&_Lee,_2011;_Manns_&_Eichenbaum,_2009_CITE), associating place cell representations of specific locations with the representations of specific objects in recognition memory (the perirhinal cortex, among others, is heavily involved in recognition memory for objects Brown_&_Aggleton,_2001_CITE; Yonelinas,_Otten,_Shaw,_&_Rugg,_2005_CITE)"
"In addition, in the primate hippocampus, view-dependent instead of place-dependent cells have also been identified (dubbed spatial-view cells Rolls_&_Xiang,_2006_CITE)"
"Finally, an interesting cell type with spatially localized firing activity has been found in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), representing goal or reward locations ( Hok,_Save,_Lenck-Santini,_&_Poucet,_2005_CITE)."
"Evidence for this includes the observation that place cells re-map when rats enter a new environment (the firing fields of the same cells reflect a completely different map in different environments), and the observation that their firing field sizes can significantly differ ( Derdikman_&_Moser,_2010_CITE)."
"Such allocentric representations of physical locations in the environment have been called cognitive maps a term coined by Tolman_(1948)_CITE and there is substantial evidence that the hippocampal entorhinal complex is the main neural correlate involved in their storage and recall ( Moser_et al.,_2008_CITE)."
"Topological maps lack metric information (such as distances or directions), but provide adjacency and containment information and thus allow route planning as well (although planning optimal routes can be difficult) ( Booij,_Terwijn,_Zivkovic,_&_Krose,_2007_CITE)"
"The parieto-medial temporal pathway connects this occipito-parietal circuit with areas in the medial temporal lobe including hippocampal, entorhinal and subicular areas involved in processing long-term allocentric spatial representations supporting spatial navigation (see above) ( Kravitz_et al.,_2011_CITE)."
"Patients with parietal lesions might have intact primary sensory and motor representations, but often suffer from spatial neglect they are unable to perceive one side of space ( Husain,_2008_CITE)."
"Evidence suggests that the precuneus is the main brain area concerned with multiple types of egocentric representations, as well as transformations between them ( Kravitz_et al.,_2011;_Vogeley_et al.,_2004;_Zaehle_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
"The precuneus seems to coordinate spatial processing in the reference frames of the eyes and the head with controlling body and limb-centered actions (in addition to the intraparietal and postcentral sulci and the parieto-occipital region; Plank,_2009_CITE; Vogeley_et al.,_2004_CITE) for example, area 5d within this parietal area seems to represent reach vectors (hand position relative to reach target)."
"Neuropsychological studies have also implicated the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) in representing visual stimuli in the reference frame of the body ( Snyder,_Grieve,_Brotchie,_&_Andersen,_1998_CITE), the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) containing receptive fields with head-centered reference frames Duhamel,_Colby,_and_Goldberg_(1998)_CITE, the medial intraparietal area (MIP) in the encoding of object locations in eye-centric coordinates ( Pesaran,_Nelson,_&_Andersen,_2006_CITE), and area 6a ( Marzocchi,_Breveglieri,_Galletti,_&_Fattori,_2008_CITE)"
"The latter two areas have also been called the parietal reach region and seem to encode the location of reach targets in an eye-centered reference frame ( Bhattacharyya,_Musallam,_&_Andersen,_2009_CITE)"
"Apart from visuospatial representations, the basal ganglia also play an important role in egocentric navigation, and are thought to associate a cue with a reward ( Packard_&_McGaugh,_1996_CITE), triggering guidance behavior along a known route"
"This taxon strategy seems to be in use mainly when a route is well-known ( Hartley,_Maguire,_Spiers,_&_Burgess,_2003_CITE)"
"The RSC receives direct inputs from visual areas V2 and V4, and egocentric sensory information from parietal areas 7a and LIP, among others; as well as inputs from the hippocampal formation and the anterior thalamus usually associated with allocentric position and heading information ( Vann,_Aggleton,_&_Maguire,_2009_CITE)."
"There is strong empirical evidence for such a learning mechanism ubiquitously occurring in brains ( Song,_Miller,_&_Abbott,_2000_CITE)"
"In a variant of Hebbian learning, called competitive learning, neurons of one population compete with each other to respond to the pattern appearing in another population from which they receive input (the more strongly a neuron responds to the input, the more it inhibits other neurons, and the more its connection strengths to highly active input neurons increase) ( Grossberg,_1987;_Kaski_&_Kohonen,_1994;_Rumelhart_&_Zipser,_1985_CITE)."
"As mentioned above, the mPFC seems to be involved in representing goal or reward locations ( Hok_et al.,_2005_CITE) (and has also been suggested to be involved in responding to rewards)"
"To select an action based on an expected reward, stimulus response or response reward associations have to be learned; empirical evidence implicates the dorsal striatum in this process (which exhibits increased activity when a contingency is established between responses and reward) ( Maia,_2009;_O Doherty,_2004_CITE)."
"The name comes from the reinforcement signal a numerical reward used in such models; RL agents aim to choose actions that maximize the reward they obtain over time ( Woergoetter_&_Porr,_2008_CITE)"
"They should also have the ability to generalize to new data, not only account for the data provided to the model during development and training ( Myung_et al.,_2005_CITE)."
"Explicating the correspondence between model components and brain areas, as done by the researchers of ACT-R ( Anderson_et al.,_2008_CITE) (who have also performed brain imaging experiments for validation), helps to verify structural similarity between the model and the corresponding neural substrate, and thus also to evaluate claims of biological plausibility"
"In contrast, neural network-based spatial memory models are based on a number of simple processing units affecting each other via weighted connections, operate in parallel, usually employ distributed representations, and commonly learn rules from training data instead of encoding explicit rules ( Thomas_&_McClelland,_2008_CITE)"
"In general, robotics emphasizes high-performance solutions to low-level sensor problems (eg dealing with sensory uncertainty/noise or processing or recognizing complex sensory data), and aims for high performance (accuracy, efficiency, etc.) instead of cognitive plausibility ( Jefferies_&_Yeap,_2008_CITE)"
"However, as Gallistel_(2008)_CITE points out, the nature of the computational problems of navigation and map making based on limited information does not depend on whether one is studying biological or artificial systems"
"Computational models of cognition operating in similar environments to the modeled biological agent, and dealing with similar difficulties posed by the real world (such as complexity, limited knowledge, uncertainty, or noise), can be regarded as being more plausible than models not accounting for such difficulties ( Webb,_2000_CITE)"
"A number of processes operate on these representations, creating, modifying, or deleting them ( Smolensky,_1987_CITE)"
"There is usually very little similarity between the elementary representations of symbolic models and biological neurons (mainly because of the choice of localist and amodal representations, in contrast to the distributed and more modal representations of the brain; Barsalou,_2008_CITE; Martin_&_Chao,_2001_CITE)"
Jefferies_and_Yeap_(2008)_CITE provides a survey of such cognitive mapping approaches that have been designed to work on robots
"SLAM is usually implemented by a probabilistic state estimation method, integrating self-motion information and landmark observations in a statistically optimal fashion ( Jefferies_&_Yeap,_2008;_Thrun_&_Leonard,_2008_CITE)."
"They fit in well with the recent Bayesian brain hypothesis ( Knill_&_Pouget,_2004_CITE); the idea that the brain integrates information in a statistically optimal fashion"
"Computational models resembling SLAM using probabilistic state estimation have been proposed to explain spatial orientation and cognitive mapping ( Cheung,_Ball,_Milford,_Wyeth,_&_Wiles,_2012;_Fox_&_Prescott,_2010_CITE)"
"It has also been suggested that hippocampal place cells might be able to perform approximate Bayesian inference on the neuronal level, based on electrophysiological recording evidence ( Madl_et al.,_2014_CITE)."
"In SLAM approaches in robotics, maps are stored in different ways, most commonly as covariance matrices, or as occupancy grids (two-dimensional matrices with entries storing the probability of occupancy), or tree-based representations ( Thrun_&_Leonard,_2008_CITE)"
"For reviews of robotic SLAM, see eg Bailey_and_Durrant-Whyte_(2006)_CITE, Durrant-Whyte_and_Bailey_(2006)_CITE and Thrun_and_Leonard_(2008)_CITE."
"Based on this model, Yeap_et al._(2008)_CITE developed a robotic system capable of building allocentric maps"
"This map was subsequently split, or merged, into distinct regions (eg corridors and rooms) using features such as average width (eg corridors are long and narrow), and employing the split and merge algorithm ( Pavlidis_&_Horowitz,_1974_CITE) to find continuous regions"
"Also drawing on the ideas of Jefferies_et al._(2008)_CITE and Yeap_(1988)_CITE proposed that a cognitive map might consist of a topological global map containing metric local space representations, aiming to benefit from the advantages of both simple localization and metric consistency of the local maps, and easier loop closing with the help of global maps (as well as the confinement of location errors to the local maps)"
"The authors argue for the psychological plausibility of their model using the empirical evidence for local and global spatial maps ( Poucet,_1993_CITE) and multiple reference frames for different parts of an environment ( Derdikman_&_Moser,_2010;_McNaughton_et al.,_2006_CITE)."
"As it is also based on Yeap_(1988)_CITE, tentative arguments of functional similarity can be made between ASR regions and place cells, and boundary elements and boundary vector cells"
"Beeson_et al._(2010)_CITE also propose a spatial memory model combining the strengths of topological and metrical approaches, calling it HSSH (Hybrid Spatial Semantic Hierarchy), an extension of the SSH model proposed by Kuipers_(2000)_CITE"
"On the first level, the LPM is built using probabilistic SLAM ( Thrun_&_Leonard,_2008_CITE) based on laser rangefinders, and represented as an occupancy grid (a discretized grid in which each cell contains the probability of being occupied by an obstacle)"
HSSH is the only model except for Jefferies_et al._(2008)_CITE capable of building a global map and closing the loop.
"Although not aiming for structural similarity to the brain, the HSSH and its predecessors claim to be theories of robot and human commonsense knowledge of large-scale space: the cognitive map ( Kuipers,_2008_CITE)"
"In terms of functional similarity, the occupancy grid employed as the low-level metric representation bears some resemblance to hippocampal place cells, as both can be used to infer the most likely location of the agent, as well as the most likely locations of boundaries ( Barry_et al.,_2006_CITE)"
"which range from 20 cm or less to multiple meters, Kjelstrup_et al.,_2008_CITE; O Keefe_&_Burgess,_1996_CITE), constancy (place fields can be destroyed or changed by adding barriers or making other changes in the environment), shape properties (occupancy grid cells are square, place cells can have multiple firing fields of different round shapes), representation (occupancy grid cells contain probabilities, place cell firing rates almost certainly do not, since they strongly depend on factors such as running speed), among others ( Moser_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"Franz_et al._(2008)_CITE have developed a robotic system on a Khepera miniature robot that accounts for egocentric route navigation, as well as allocentric topological navigation and global metric navigation (with the first two working on the robot and the latter implemented in a simulation), building on their earlier work ( Franz_&_Mallot,_2000_CITE)."
"Franz_et al._(2008)_CITE use a panoramic stereo camera to calculate the disparities of N=72 image sectors, after identifying each sector in both images (disparities are defined as how much an image sector appears shifted in the second image relative to the first; from these disparities, distances can be computed using elementary trigonometry)"
"Franz_et al._(2008)_CITE argue that their navigation strategies are biomimetic ; citing behavioral evidence from studies with insects, which lend strong support to the claim that insects seem to use mainly view-based homing for navigation ( Graham_&_Collett,_2002_CITE) a strategy resembling the disparity minimization approach of the authors"
"The model is claimed to qualitatively replicate several aspects of human spatial behavior, such as way-finding errors (three types of errors made by NAVIGATOR appear similar to humans errors made at locations with more information, at locations requiring complex navigational actions, and errors due to misidentification of the goal) ( Gopal_&_Smith,_1990_CITE)"
"Raubal_(2001)_CITE describe the perceptual wayfinding model, a cognitively based computational model for wayfinding which, unlike NAVIGATOR, considers the information needs of navigators at each decision point"
"The model is based on the Sense-Plan-Act framework, as well as affordance theory (affordances are possibilities for action) the idea that animals perceive the environment in terms of what they can do with it and in it ( Gibson,_1986_CITE)"
"In a recent model, Brom_et al._(2012)_CITE have proposed a computational model of both egocentric and allocentric spatial memory for intelligent virtual agents (IVAs), calling their spatial model the DP-model since it was evaluated in a disorientation paradigm (see below)"
"Mental states are represented as numeric activation values of the units (or subsets of the units), and learning is usually implemented by modifying connection strengths between the units ( Thomas_&_McClelland,_2008_CITE)."
"In addition to modeling neuronal and synaptic state, they also model temporal dynamics, and use short and sudden increases in voltage ( spikes ) to transmit information ( Ghosh-Dastidar_&_Adeli,_2009_CITE)"
"For ANNs, the claim of biological realism can be cast in doubt, since they make undefended design decisions (eg elements not having clear biological counterparts such as fixed biases, nonmonotonic activation functions, or the commonly used back-propagation learning algorithms) ( Dawson_&_Shamanski,_1994_CITE)."
"Still, even if their degree of realism is debatable, ANNs are structurally more similar to brains than symbolic cognitive models the representations employed by both are mostly distributed, grounded and modal Barsalou_(2008)_CITE"
"Furthermore, on a higher level, neural network-based models incorporate properties characteristic of biological cognition, such as content-addressable memory, context-sensitive processing, and graceful degradation under damage or noise Thomas_and_McClelland_(2008)_CITE"
"For example, all of them model place cells, except for the SOM model by Voicu_(2003)_CITE"
The model by Byrne_et al._(2007)_CITE accounts for all of these cell types (with a simplified anatomy).
"Burgess_et al._(2000)_CITE proposed one such model that was implemented on a Khepera robot, based on the influential idea that place cell firing is driven by inputs with Gaussian responses tuned to the presence of walls at particular distances ( O Keefe_&_Burgess,_1996_CITE) (later expanded and called Boundary Vector Cell model Barry_et al.,_2006_CITE, which successfully accounted for rat neural and human behavior data, but was not implemented in a real-world robot)"
"Sensory cells are a rectangular array of cells, each representing a different possible distance and allocentric direction to a wall, just like BVCs ( Barry_et al.,_2006_CITE) (however, unlike BVCs, only the four orthogonal compass directions are represented)"
"Another biological ANN model that is also capable of controlling a real-world Khepera robot was proposed by Str sslin_et al._(2005)_CITE, building on earlier modeling work ( Arleo_&_Gerstner,_2000_CITE)"
"Rotation cells (RCs) in LV discriminate headings regardless of position, based on average relative distance between stored and current filter activity; whereas step cells (RCs) discriminate positions regardless of headings based on perceived angular differences between landmarks (firing rates of SCs depend on the most similar column difference of the associated filters, similarly to the disparities in the model by Franz_et al._(2008)_CITE described above)"
APC place cells help calibrate PI cells using allothetic information to correct accumulating errors Etienne_et al._(1996)_CITE
"Barrera_et al._(2011)_CITE proposed another biological ANN model based on brain neurophysiology, which they evaluated against rat behavior data, unlike the previously reviewed models (extending their earlier work Barrera_&_Weitzenfeld,_2008_CITE)"
"Similarly to the model by Str sslin_et al._(2005)_CITE above, they use modeled place cells to represent spatial locations, and use reinforcement learning to learn appropriate reward-oriented actions at spatial locations"
"Additionally, although not replicating neural data, the authors present results verifying the engagement of the proposed neural correlates of their models (reporting gene expression data) in the rats they used in their experiments ( Barrera_et al.,_2011_CITE)."
"A further neural network based model of mapping very successful in robotics which was also inspired by rat neurophysiology is RatSLAM ( Milford_&_Wyeth,_2010_CITE)"
"Sch lkopf_and_Mallot_(1995)_CITE proposed a neural network model of cognitive map learning in a maze, a model aiming for cognitive rather than biological plausibility (but nevertheless pointing out similarities to neural substrate)"
"Their agent employs a central perception action cycle ( Fuster,_2002_CITE) (similarly to the sense plan act cycle of the symbolic perceptual wayfinding model; Raubal,_2001_CITE)"
"The view graph is learned using a SOM-type (self-organizing sequence map) neural network ( Kohonen,_1990_CITE), which has three layers: an input layer (with units representing views), a movement layer (representing the movements left, right or back; with only one of these three units active at each time), and a map layer"
"A map of the current maze is learned by random exploration , ie a large number of random movements and views are passed to the network, which uses learning by self-organization ( Kohonen,_1990_CITE) to assign map units in a way that they closely resemble the view graph (ie near views are represented by near units, and distant views by distant units)"
"It is also one of only three neural network models implementing topological maps (the other two being Barrera_et al.,_2011_CITE and Erdem_&_Hasselmo,_2012_CITE)."
"A model also based on self-organized learning was proposed by Voicu_(2003)_CITE, extending their earlier work ( Voicu_&_Schmajuk,_2000_CITE)"
"A further difference is that it learns hierarchical instead of flat spatial representations which is frequently argued to be the structure of cognitive maps (see Derdikman_&_Moser,_2010_CITE, Hirtle_&_Jonides,_1985_CITE and McNamara,_1986_CITE, for behavioral and Derdikman_&_Moser,_2010_CITE, for neural evidence)."
"The cognitive map itself uses types of SOM (recurrently connected hetero-associative networks; Kohonen,_1990_CITE) to build associations"
It was tested and evaluated by Samsonovich_and_McNaughton_(1997)_CITE and later reviewed and argued to be plausible based on neural evidence by McNaughton_et al._(2006)_CITE
"The model and its elements are neuroanatomically plausible; MEC might perform path integration (passing activation to hippocampal place cells), and the analogy between modeled and biological HD cells is clear (see McNaughton_et al.,_2006_CITE for evidence)"
"Similarly to the BVC model and its predecessors ( Burgess_et al.,_2000_CITE), place cell firing is driven by BVCs (the firing of which in turn depends on the distances and directions of boundaries)"
"In contrast to these navigation strategies, Erdem_and_Hasselmo_(2012)_CITE have proposed a SNN model of navigation based on probing linear look-ahead trajectories in several candidate directions to find a trajectory leading to the goal location"
"Modeled grid cell firing is based on the persistent spiking cell model (briefly, grid fields arise from an interference oscillation in persistent spiking cells) ( Hasselmo,_2008_CITE)"
"Place cells are driven by grid cells in the model, as suggested before by theoretical models ( Moser_et al.,_2008;_Solstad_et al.,_2006_CITE); place fields arise from a thresholded product of the grid fields (the multiplication is implemented using coincidence detection in the model)."
"The model was able to produce grid cell ensemble activity resembling recorded rat medial entorhinal neurons demonstrating look-ahead activity in a T-maze navigation task ( Gupta,_Erdem,_&_Hasselmo,_2013_CITE)."
"In contrast to computational cognitive models focused on accounting for one or few specific processes, systems-level cognitive architectures aim to comprehensively model a wide range of cognitive phenomena, attempting to account for behavior and structural properties of minds ( Sun,_2007_CITE)"
"The general usefulness of these chunks and production rules is stored in a neural network reflecting previous usage (which has led some researchers to categorize ACT-R as a hybrid cognitive architecture, despite it being primarily symbolic Duch_et al.,_2008_CITE)."
"ACT-R has been used to replicate a large number of psychological experiments ( Anderson_et al.,_2004_CITE)"
"One such extension, called ACT-R/S was proposed by Harrison_et al._(2003)_CITE, adding two additional systems to ACT-R: a manipulative system (representing spatial characteristics of objects facilitating manipulation), and a configural system (representing the relative, approximate configuration of objects in space)"
Casimir by Schultheis_and_Barkowsky_(2011)_CITE is a cognitive architecture explicitly devised as a framework for computationally modeling human spatial knowledge processing
"Because of its emphasis on structural modeling (spatio-analogical instead of symbolic representations), Casimir is argued to exceed the modeling capabilities of other cognitive architectures in the spatial domain ( Schultheis_&_Barkowsky,_2011_CITE)"
"The architecture was tested on paradigms involving eye movements in a spatial reasoning task ( Sima,_Lindner,_Schultheis,_&_Barkowsky,_2010_CITE), mental scanning (the effect of the time to scan between entities in a mental image increasing linearly with the distance between them), mental reinterpretation of spatial relations ( Sima,_2011_CITE), and recall effects ( Schultheis,_Lile,_&_Barkowsky,_2007_CITE)"
"The model is heavily based on prevalent cognitive science theories of mental representations (eg analogical representations Barsalou,_2008_CITE, mental models Mani_&_Johnson-Laird,_1982_CITE, mental images Shepard_&_Metzler,_1971_CITE), and replicates human behavior data in a number of paradigms"
CLARION by Sun_and_Zhang_(2004)_CITE is a hybrid cognitive architecture accounting for spatial representations
"CLARION ability to represent and navigate in space is shown in the complex minefield navigation (MN) task implemented by Sun,_Merrill,_and_Peterson_(2001)_CITE"
"Although not modeling neurons, LIDA is biologically inspired, with each major part of the model functionally mapped to brain areas ( Franklin_et al.,_2014;_Goertzel_et al.,_2010_CITE), and is largely based on the Global Workspace Theory of functional consciousness ( Baars_&_Franklin,_2009;_Baars,_Franklin,_&_Ramsoy,_2013_CITE), as well as a number of psychological and neuropsychological theories including grounded cognition ( Barsalou,_2008_CITE), working memory ( Baddeley,_1992_CITE), and Slomans H-CogAff cognitive framework ( Sloman,_1998_CITE) among others"
"It is a recent architecture and only partially implemented, but has replicated a number of psychological experiments ( Franklin_et al.,_2014_CITE)."
"LIDA cognitive cycles, corresponding to the action perception cycles in neuroscience Fuster_(2002)_CITE, consist of three phases"
"These PAM node structures parts of the PAM network are hierarchical, modal representations similar to Barsalou perceptual symbols Barsalou_(2008)_CITE"
"This can account for systematic position errors in humans due to hierarchical representation ( Madl_et al.,_2013_CITE)."
"It can be shown that in multi-goal navigation tasks, gradient ascent on a single map leads to a sub-optimal nearest-neighbor strategy (as does the look-ahead approach ( Erdem_&_Hasselmo,_2012_CITE) and RL with simple goal-distances as rewards ( Barrera_et al.,_2011;_Str sslin_et al.,_2005_CITE), although RL with different reward functions can improve this)"
"LIDA-based agents have been shown to be able to perform mapping and navigation, and model human behavior in different tasks, including modeling map recall errors, capacity limits of spatial working memory, and errors in the TSP paradigm ( Madl_et al.,_2013_CITE) (work is underway to embody LIDA on a robot ( Franklin_et al.,_2014_CITE) and to extend it with both egocentric and allocentric real-world spatial memory)"
"(Symbolic Brom_et al.,_2012_CITE): replication of human accuracies in pointing tasks (subjects/agent had to remember locations of several objects in a room, and subsequently asked to point to the locations after the objects have been removed)"
"(Neural network-based Barry_et al.,_2006_CITE; Burgess_et al.,_2000_CITE): This model is the only reviewed model which was compared to both electrophysiological data from rat place cells, and behavioral data human subjects"
"(Neural network-based Barrera_et al.,_2011_CITE): The model learning curve when learning to reach a goal in a maze was comparable to that of rats in an experiment"
"(Neural network-based Voicu,_2003_CITE): The model imposed hierarchies comparable to human hierarchical cognitive maps, and resulted in comparable distance estimation biases"
"(Cognitive architecture-based Schultheis_&_Barkowsky,_2011_CITE): Replication of eye movements in spatial reasoning, mental scanning, mental reinterpretation of spatial relations, and recall effects"
"(Cognitive architecture-based Sun_&_Zhang,_2004_CITE): Replication of human data in a minefield navigation task"
"(Cognitive architecture-based Madl_et al.,_2013_CITE): Replication of human performance in the traveling salesman problem and of map representation errors"
"It should be noted that although all of these models can be said to create maps (of different kinds and different accuracies), only a few of them can be said to be modeling cognitive maps in the sense of Tolman_(1948)_CITE, who has pointed out that cognitive maps can be used to plan novel routes such as shortcuts or detours (for known routes, no allocentric map would be necessary)"
"In this sense, only 7 models are accounting for cognitive maps those that can perform path planning (see also the Abilities row in Figs_2 9 ): Beeson_et al._(2010)_CITE, Byrne_et al._(2007)_CITE, Erdem_and_Hasselmo_(2012)_CITE, Gopal_and_Smith_(1990)_CITE, Madl_et al._(2013)_CITE, Sch lkopf_and_Mallot_(1995)_CITE and Voicu_(2003)_CITE."
"Examples are the development of statistical methods to deal with sensory uncertainty (which later proved to help explain behavioral and neural data, starting the Bayesian brain movement; Knill_&_Pouget,_2004_CITE), machine learning approaches for learning optimal action policies in unpredictable environments (reinforcement learning, which has contributed to understanding the neuroscientific study of conditioning; Maia,_2009_CITE), or dynamical systems and control theory (which have inspired dynamical systems approaches to cognition; Beer,_2000_CITE)."
"The first point the importance of allocentric spatial representations has been known to cognitive science for many decades ( Tolman,_1948_CITE)"
"Along similar lines, it has long been suspected that the cognitive map might be hierarchical ( Derdikman_&_Moser,_2010;_Hirtle_&_Jonides,_1985;_McNamara,_1986_CITE), and multiple models incorporate hierarchies in their maps (such as HSSH, the model by Voicu,_2003_CITE, LIDA, and Casimir)"
"Plausible neural correlates of hierarchical maps have also been identified in hippocampal and entorhinal cortical neurons with significantly varying firing field sizes ( Derdikman_&_Moser,_2010_CITE)"
"Some of the reviewed models include both types of representations ( Beeson_et al.,_2010;_Brom_et al.,_2012;_Byrne_et al.,_2007;_Franz_et al.,_2008;_Schultheis_&_Barkowsky,_2011_CITE)"
"Other well known measures include Mean Square Error [6]_CITE, cross-entropy [20]_CITE, and AUC (eg, [17]_CITE)"
"Relevant work devised to shed light on the characteristics of the above measures include [34]_CITE, [22]_CITE, [39]_CITE, and [24]_CITE"
"There are also many graphical representations and tools for model evaluation, such as ROC curves, a 2D visual environment widely acknowledged as the default choice for assessing the intrinsic behavior of a classifier (see, for instance, [5]_CITE and [13]_CITE), ROC isometrics [16]_CITE, and cost curves [11]_CITE"
"Besides classical approaches, eg, Fisher linear discriminant analysis [15]_CITE and Pearson correlation coefficient [14]_CITE, a number of proposals have been made over time"
"Starting from the definition given in [4]_CITE, Guyon and Elisseeff [21]_CITE divide feature selection methods in three broad groups: filter, wrapper and embedded methods"
An alternative grouping strategy can be found in the work of Dash and Liu [8]_CITE
"Borrowing relevant categories from [3]_CITE and [4]_CITE, the authors divide evaluation functions in five groups: distance, information-theoretic, dependence, consistency, and classifier error rate"
Notable examples in this category are LDA [19]_CITE and ICA [26]_CITE
"Recent work in this category includes LFDA [37]_CITE, sparse LDA [33]_CITE and CDA [30]_CITE"
"Information-theoretic measures, typically aimed at evaluating the entropy or the mutual information of features, have been adopted in various feature ranking or feature subset assessment methods (see, for instance, [2]_CITE, [27]_CITE, [12]_CITE, [35]_CITE and [7]_CITE)"
"Beyond the classical correlation measures (eg, Pearson correlation coefficient or cosine similarity), more recent proposals in this field include CCA (eg, [23]_CITE) and dCOV/dCOR [38]_CITE"
"Among other proposals made in this field, let us recall [9]_CITE, [40]_CITE, [1]_CITE and [36]_CITE"
"Relevant proposals that fall in this group are [25]_CITE, [31]_CITE and [29]_CITE."
"In [16]_CITE, Flach gave definitions of some unbiased measures starting from classical ones"
"Let us verify it, starting from the classical definition given in Friedman [18]_CITE: (17)biasf^(X)=f(X) E[f^(X)]where f( X) corresponds to the output of an oracle over a set X of samples and E[f^(X)] to the expected value over X of the corresponding classifier"

"Note that, in accordance with the Zipf law [41]_CITE, most of the terms are located at the left hand corner of the constraining diamond"
"Woolley_and_Pidd_(1981_CITE, p_197) described problem structuring as the process by which the initially presented set of conditions is translated into a set of problems, issues and questions sufficiently well defined to allow specific research action"
"In theory and practice, problem structuring methods have gained more and more attention ( Franco_&_Montibeller,_2010;_Mingers_&_Rosenhead,_2001;_Tavella_&_Papadopoulos,_2014_CITE)"
"Problem structuring methods (PSM) are described by Rosenhead_(2013_CITE, p_1162) as a broad group of model-based problem handling approaches whose purpose is to assist in the structuring of problems rather than directly to derive a solution"
"These methods are most frequently applied by groups and are characterised by participation and interactivity ( Rosenhead,_2013_CITE)."
"They will also structure and evaluate the relative advantages and disadvantages of different strategic options before selecting a problem focus and/or a course of action (negotiate) ( Franco_&_Meadows,_2007_CITE, p_1624)"
"They pioneered in systematically analysing the impact of Jung's_(1971)_CITE theory of psychological types in context of PSM and derive logically from literature eight hypotheses, eg that sensing and intuitive individuals will play a lead role during option designing tasks, in comparison to thinking and feeling individuals (p"
"Garfield,_Taylor,_Dennis,_and_Satzinger_(2001)_CITE identified empirically that innovative, radical alternatives are created by intuitive and feeling individuals more often than by sensing and thinking individuals."
Bateman_and_Crant_(1993)_CITE define proactive behaviour as the relatively stable tendency to effect environmental change
"The essential characteristic of proactive behaviour is that people can intentionally and directly change their current circumstances, social or nonsocial, including their physical environment ( Bateman_&_Crant,_1993_CITE, p_104, referring to Buss,_1987_CITE)"
"Individuals classified as reactive, by contrast, are relatively passive and are rather shaped by their environment than shaping it themselves ( Parker,_Bindl,_&_Strauss,_2010_CITE)"
"Proactive individuals actively search for opportunities, take initiative, and proceed with their actions until they achieve their objectives ( Bateman_&_Crant,_1993_CITE)"
"Schwarzer_(1999)_CITE develops a scale to measure the personality trait proactive attitude, which can affect motivations and imply actions"
"They follow goals that they think are worth reaching for ( Parker_et_al.,_2010;_Schwarzer,_1999_CITE)"
"Individuals cannot change their personality traits related to decision-making easily ( VandenBos,_2007_CITE)"
"However, Kirby,_Kirby,_and_Lewis_(2002_CITE, p_1542) find empirical evidence that proactivity can be trained by the development of context specific knowledge and skills ."
"As it has been postulated and verified empirically, proactive personality traits ( eg Seibert,_Crant,_&_Kraimer,_1999;_Thompson,_2005_CITE) as well as proactive cognitive skills ( Keeney,_1992_CITE) can have positive impacts on an individual in decision situations"
"Research in OR focuses on best practices or on developing and improving highly sophisticated methods ( eg Corbett,_Overmeer,_&_Van_Wassenhove,_1995_CITE)"
"H m l inen,_Luoma,_and_Saarinen_(2013_CITE, p_623) indicate the importance of behavioural operational research (BOR) as the study of behavioural aspects related to the use of [ ] OR methods in modelling, problem solving and decision support"
"Lu_et_al._(2001)_CITE state that in OR applications, the personality as well as the communication style of the decision analyst and the decision-maker may have a huge impact"
"Appropriate tools and methods for eliciting information about the decision analyst and the decision-maker are still needed, in particular in problem structuring, since hardly any behavioural research has been done on the process itself and on the role of the analyst and problem owner ( H m l inen_et_al.,_2013_CITE, p_623)"
"These tools and methods have to be selected on the basis of the skills, knowledge, personal style and experience of the analyst ( H m l inen_et_al.,_2013_CITE, p_624, referring to Ormerod,_2008_CITE)"
Grant_and_Ashford_(2008)_CITE point out that proactive behaviour involves acting in advance of future situations
"Researchers describe this characteristic using the adjectives future-focused , anticipatory , and forward-looking ( Frese,_2006;_Frese_&_Fay,_2001;_Frese,_Kring,_Soose,_&_Zempel,_1996;_Greenglass,_2002_CITE)"
"Proactive behaviour is characterised by the intention of having a discernible effect on the self and/or the environment ( Grant_&_Ashford,_2008_CITE, p_9)"
"Proactive individuals are change-oriented and interested in creating a meaningful impact on their environment ( Buss,_1987;_Diener,_Larsen,_&_Emmons,_1984_CITE)"
"Reactive individuals, by contrast, are passive and react to, adapt to, and are constrained by their environment instead of shaping it themselves ( Bateman_&_Crant,_1993_CITE)"
"Schwarzer_(1999)_CITE, who developed a scale to measure proactive attitudes, points out that individuals purpose in life is defined by striving for ambitious goals"
Parker_et_al._(2010)_CITE emphasise the generation of goals as well as the endeavours to achieve them
"Proactive individuals take the initiative in pursuing personal and organisational goals ( Frese_&_Fay,_2001;_Roberson,_1990_CITE)"
"Proactive individuals scan for opportunities, show initiative, take action, and persevere until they reach closure by bringing about change ( Bateman_&_Crant,_1993_CITE, p_105)"
"Proactive behaviour is considered to be relatively stable and cannot be changed easily ( Bateman_&_Crant,_1993_CITE)"
"The VandenBos_(2007_CITE, p_950) defines a personality trait as a relatively stable, consistent, and enduring internal characteristic that is inferred from a pattern of behaviours, attitudes, feelings, and habits in the individual"
"However, Kirby_et_al._(2002_CITE, p_1542) find empirical evidence that proactivity can be trained by the development of context-specific knowledge and skills"
"Referring to proactive behaviour, Seibert_et_al._(1999)_CITE analyse the association with endogenous constructs"
Crant_and_Bateman_(2000)_CITE discover that employees who show proactive behaviour are recognised as charismatic leaders
"Furthermore, Thompson_(2005)_CITE links proactive personality to job performance conceived by superiors"
"Decision-making is the process of making a choice between competing courses of action ( von_Winterfeldt_&_Edwards,_1986_CITE)"
"It is a dynamic process: a complex search for information, full of detours, enriched by feedback from casting about in all directions, gathering and discarding information, fuelled by fluctuating uncertainty, indistinct and conflicting concepts some sharp, some hazy ( Zeleny,_1982_CITE, p_3)"
"Individuals and organisations have only through decisions an impact on their situation ( Keeney,_1992_CITE)"
"On the basis of normative models of the decision theory, processes can be derived as to how individuals should proceed in order to achieve a maximum of their values, objectives, and well-being ( Bell,_Raiffa,_&_Tversky,_1988;_Howard,_1988_CITE)"
Furby_and_Beyth-Marom_(1992)_CITE summarise five steps of decision-making
Howard_(1988)_CITE emphasises the need to distinguish between decision and outcome
"A good decision is an action we take that is logically consistent with the alternatives we perceive, the information we have, and the preferences we feel ( Howard,_1988_CITE, p_682)"
von_Winterfeldt_and_Edwards_(1986)_CITE conclude that a decision cannot be judged by its outcome
"Thus, the quality of a decision can only be evaluated by the process in the course of which it was made and it has to be evaluated by looking at the stages of the decision process before the outcome occurs ( von_Winterfeldt_&_Edwards,_1986_CITE)"
"However, across the life span, decision-making skills are related to obtaining good decision outcomes ( Bruine_de_Bruin,_Parker,_&_Fischhoff,_2012_CITE)."
"Furthermore, Howard_(1988)_CITE introduces seven elements of decision quality"
Keeney_(1992)_CITE introduces a normative approach to PDM
"Instead of following the traditional process of identifying a problem, generating alternatives, and defining criteria for the evaluation of outcomes before making a choice, Keeney_(1992)_CITE suggests that decision-makers seek out decision opportunities proactively"
"In other words, people think first of what they desire (themselves) and then of possible alternatives that are useful for reaching the desired objective ( Keeney,_1992_CITE)"
"Siebert_and_Keeney_(forthcoming)_CITE identify that decision-makers are able to list only one third of their potentially relevant alternatives, but significantly more and better when being stimulated with objectives."
"Scott_and_Bruce_(1995_CITE, p_820, based on Driver,_1979;_Driver,_Brousseau,_&_Hunsaker,_1990;_Harren,_1979_CITE) speak of a habit based propensity to react in a certain way in a specific decision context"
"Some are derived from personality traits ( eg Epstein,_1973_CITE), while others are derived from situational aspects ( eg Novak_&_Hoffman,_2009_CITE)."
"Epstein ( 1973,_1983,_1985,_1994,_2003_CITE) introduce the concept of thinking styles, providing also implications for decision-making"
"Rational thinking, by contrast, is logical, based on the cause-and-effect rule, hierarchical, sequential, process-oriented, slowly implemented but quickly changed, of much effort, oriented towards delayed action, conscious, and actively experienced with the individual being aware of and in control of the process ( Epstein,_1994,_2003;_Kahnemann_&_Frederick,_2002;_Sloman,_1996;_Smith_&_DeCoster,_2000_CITE)"
The Rational Experiential Inventory (REI) developed by Epstein_et_al._(1996)_CITE has been used to measure individual differences in dispositional tendencies to adopt rational and experiential thinking styles.
"In contrast to these dispositional thinking styles, Novak_and_Hoffman_(2009)_CITE define a situation specific thinking style as the particular thinking style or momentary thinking orientation adopted by a consumer in a specific (decision) situation"
"As Scott_and_Bruce_(1995_CITE) do, they emphasise the situational factors"
"In recent studies, Novak_and_Hoffman_(2009)_CITE have considered situations in order to incorporate the different tasks or activities that consumers may undertake as well as different motivations or orientations that consumers may reveal when they undertake a specific task or activity"
"The situation specific thinking style may be influenced by the task itself or by the consumer's underlying motive for performing a given task, independently of the task itself ( Novak_&_Hoffman,_2009_CITE)."
"These cognitive skills can be acquired through training and practice ( VandenBos,_2007_CITE)"
"While proactive personality traits are regarded as a stable disposition in decision situations, the proactive way of thinking can be changed more easily by training the related cognitive skills ( VandenBos,_2007_CITE)"
"The distinction between personality traits and cognitive skills can help explain the results of Kirby_et_al._(2002)_CITE), who have found empirical evidence that proactivity is trainable since cognitive skills can be trained."
"It has been verified empirically that proactive personality traits can have positive impacts on an individual in decision situations ( Seibert_et_al.,_1999_CITE)"
"Although Keeney_(1992)_CITE postulates positive impacts of a proactive way of thinking, these have not been verified empirically yet"
"In this section, we derive the four dimensions systematic identification of objectives , systematic search for information , systematic identification of alternatives , and using a decision radar which represent proactive cognitive skills in decision situations from decision-making, in particular from the first four of the elements of decision quality ( Howard,_1988_CITE), and the value-focused thinking framework ( Keeney,_1992_CITE)"
"According to Schwarzer_(1999)_CITE and Keeney_(1992)_CITE, proactive individuals have a vision and are guided by values"
"Their purpose in life is generated by striving for ambitious goals ( Schwarzer,_1999_CITE)"
"The anticipation and imagination of objectives encourage individuals to pursue these objectives ( Locke_&_Latham,_2002_CITE)"
"They are the basis for systematically creating alternatives, guiding the methodical search for information, and planning decisions ( Siebert_&_Keeney,_forthcoming_CITE)"
"Proactive individuals, by contrast, try to create more and better alternatives ( Keeney,_1992_CITE)"
"As previous research has shown, using objectives for the systematic identification of alternatives results in more and better alternatives ( Butler_&_Scherer,_1997;_Gettys,_Pliske,_Manning,_&_Casey,_1987;_Jungermann,_Ulardt,_&_Hausmann,_1983;_Pitz,_Sachs,_&_Heerboth,_1980;_Siebert_&_Keeney,_forthcoming_CITE)"
"Furthermore, using objectives for the identification of alternatives increases the likelihood that individuals will actually achieve their objectives ( Grant_&_Ashford,_2008_CITE, referring to Gollwitzer,_1999;_Gollwitzer_&_Brandst tter,_1997;_Gollwitzer_&_Oettingen,_1998_CITE)"
"The relevant values guide the collection of information in a decision situation ( Keeney,_1992_CITE)"
"Reactive individuals only use information that is available or easily accessible and do not gather information systematically ( Keeney,_1992_CITE)"
"Proactive individuals are characterised as future-oriented ( Frese_et_al.,_1996;_Frese_&_Fay,_2001,_2006;_Greenglass,_2002_CITE)"
"This includes not only the anticipation of future events but also the prevention of future problems and active creation of decision opportunities ( Frese_&_Fay,_2001;_Weick_&_Roberts,_1993;_Weick,_Sutcliffe,_&_Obstfeld,_1999_CITE)"
"Furthermore, decisions can be planned in a broader context and it can be ensured that the right problems are dealt with ( Howard,_1988_CITE)"
"Proactive individuals strive for a discernible effect on the self and/or the environment ( Grant_&_Ashford,_2008_CITE)"
"They are interested in creating a meaningful impact ( Buss,_1987;_Diener_et_al.,_1984;_Grant_&_Ashford,_2008_CITE)"
"Proactive individuals strive for improvement in decision situations ( Iyengar,_Wells,_&_Schwartz,_2006;_Parker_et_al.,_2010_CITE)"
"Firstly, proactive cognitive skills are contrasted with vigilance ( Mann,_Burnett,_Radford,_&_Ford,_1997_CITE), rational decision-making ( Scott_&_Bruce,_1995_CITE), and rational thinking ( Novak_&_Hoffman,_2009_CITE)"
"Secondly, proactive traits are differentiated from buck-passing and procrastination ( Mann_et_al.,_1997_CITE) and maximisation ( Schwartz_et_al.,_2002_CITE)."
"Using a conflict model, Mann_et_al._(1997)_CITE have found empirical evidence for four basic patterns of coping with stress generated by difficult, potentially threatening decisions: vigilance, buck-passing, procrastination, and hyper-vigilance"
"Vigilance posits a decision maker who clarifies objectives, considers alternatives, evaluates consequences, and thinks through how to implement chosen options ( Mann_et_al.,_1997_CITE, p_5)"
"To illustrate the concept of vigilance in the context of decisions in more detail, we discuss the six items Mann_et_al._(1997)_CITE used to measure vigilance"
"According to Keeney_(1992)_CITE, this cannot be effective"
"Scott_and_Bruce_(1995_CITE) identify four decision-making styles that represent the way how individuals usually react in decision situations: a rational decision-making style, an intuitive decision-making style, a dependent decision-making style and an avoidant decision-making style"
Novak_and_Hoffman_(2009)_CITE develop a scale for rational and experimental thinking
Mann_et_al._(1997)_CITE find empirical evidence for procrastination and buck-passing as two aspects of defensive avoidance
Scott_and_Bruce_(1995_CITE) describe the same phenomenon regarding the avoidant and dependent decision-making styles
Frost_and_Shows_(1993)_CITE develop a scale to measure compulsive indecisiveness
Schwartz_et_al._(2002)_CITE distinguish between maximiser and satisficer referring to the degree to which people select ideal alternatives instead of acceptable alternatives
"Burnett,_Mann,_and_Beswick_(1989)_CITE identify a modest but significant correlation between dimensions of Flinder's Decision-Making Questionnaire ( Mann,_1982_CITE), which uses, for example, vigilance, and course satisfaction of students"
"This assumption is supported by Keeney_(1992)_CITE who postulates that using value-focused thinking, what implies the use of proactive cognitive skills, improves an individual's quality of life"
"For proving this assumption, we analyse a consequence construct of PDM and have decided to use the adapted Decision Satisfaction Scale ( Fitzsimons,_2000_CITE)."
"PDM is theoretically presumed to be a (multidimensional) construct, which is not directly observable ( DeVellis,_1991_CITE)"
"To ensure consistency, reflective specified multiple-item-measures were operationalised for each construct dimension ( Bollen,_1989_CITE)"
"In terms of wording, although some similarity among items was intended to tap the domain, items were phrased simple, straightforward, and non-redundant, ie with a certain degree of variety to express the amplitude of each construct dimension ( Netemeyer_et_al.,_2003_CITE, p_57)"
"Since we were interested in the relationship between PDM and other constructs, Decision Satisfaction was operationalised by choosing appropriate items from a short version of the Decision Satisfaction Scale ( Fitzsimons,_2000_CITE) that we adapted."
"The model's and item's goodness (of fit) need to be evaluated ( Churchill,_1979_CITE)"
"As recommended by Netemeyer_et_al._(2003_CITE, p_149), we employed EFA and item analyses to trim/retain items for the final form of a scale"
"The factor structure (components) was proven to be highly reliable at the end of the item selection process (eigenvalues, scree tests, total variance explained, communalities, Cronbach's alphas, and item-to-total correlations are used to explore the factors; according to Fabrigar,_Wegener,_MacCallum,_&_Strahan,_1999_CITE)"
"Fit statistics were evaluated according to the thresholds recommended by Akaike_(1987),_Browne_and_Cudeck_(1993_CITE), Homburg_and_Baumgartner_(1995_CITE), Hu_and_Bentler_(1999_CITE), and Arbuckle_(2008_CITE)."
"In main study I (refining the scale), reliability as well as construct validity were tested by composite reliability ( Nunnally,_1978_CITE), cross-loadings between different construct dimensions and chi-square difference tests ( Anderson_&_Gerbing,_1988;_Bagozzi_&_Phillips,_1982;_J reskog,_1971_CITE)"
"In main studies II (finalising the scale), reliability as well as convergent and discriminant validity were gauged by composite reliability (CR .6, Bagozzi_&_Yi,_1988_CITE), average variance extracted (AVE) and the criterion established by Fornell_and_Larcker_(1981)_CITE"
"Regarding the latter [f]or newly developed scales, values near the .5 threshold (>.45) seem reasonable ( Netemeyer_et_al.,_2003_CITE, p_153)."
"As a consequence, common method bias may be an issue ( Podsakoff,_MacKenzie,_Lee,_&_Podsakoff,_2003;_Podsakoff_&_Organ,_1986_CITE)"
"This was considered a priori during the design of our studies and data collections ( MacKenzie_&_Podsakoff,_2012_CITE), eg by separating predictor (PDM) and criterion (DSA) variables in different blocks of the questionnaire, relatively low complexity and short length of the surveys, emphasis that there were no right or wrong answers, provision of an I don't know -option, limited reverse scoring, application of different scale types for dependent and independent variables, voluntary participation, and protecting respondent anonymity"
"Common method bias was further addressed post hoc by applying Harman's single factor test ( Podsakoff_et_al.,_2003_CITE)."
"However, Imp_1 remained because each factor should be measured by at least three items ( Bollen,_1989_CITE) and the item tapped the construct domain and was non-redundant."
"The factor loadings of the remaining 18 items were predominantly within the desired range of .6 and .9 ( Netemeyer_et_al.,_2003_CITE, p_153)"
"Although indicator reliabilities of Alt_2, Rad_5 and Ini_3 were a bit low, all values of composite reliabilities were acceptable and above the threshold of .6 ( Bagozzi_&_Yi,_1988_CITE)"
"Evaluated on basis of AVE greater than .45 for newly developed scales ( Netemeyer_et_al.,_2003_CITE), evidence for convergent validity existed for all six PDM factors"
"Since DSA was measured with an adapted short scale introduced by Fitzsimons_(2000)_CITE, we ensured validity and reliability by another factor analysis"
"In terms of the relationships between the six PDM dimensions, one has to consider PDM as being a higher order construct ( Hair_et_al.,_2010_CITE), ie PDM as a second order or even a third order construct comprising cognitive skills and personality traits as second order constructs"
"Multicollinearity should not be an issue when explaining DSA since the PDM factors had initially been extracted in an EFA, the reliability of the measures as well as the explanatory capacity were high and sample size was large ( Grewal,_Cote,_&_Baumgartner,_2004_CITE)"
"The VIF values ranged from 1.121 to 2.553, ie all values were close to 1 and clearly below the threshold of 3 ( Hair_et_al.,_2010;_O'Brien,_2007_CITE)."
"Considering the uncertainty in decision-making and the distinction between a decision and its outcome ( Howard,_1988_CITE) as well as numerous possible antecedents of satisfaction with one's decision in addition to PDM, such as anticipated regret, evaluation costs, choice confidence ( Heitmann,_Lehmann,_&_Herrmann,_2007_CITE), etc., and the distorted perception of a decision, PDM represented a relevant predictor with significant explanatory power."
"Thus, common method bias had been sufficiently controlled and did not appear to be problematic in these studies ( Podsakoff_et_al.,_2003_CITE)"
"Hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis multi-trait multi-method approach could be used to explore the validity of the PDM as higher order construct in future studies ( Guo,_Aveyard,_Fielding,_&_Sutton,_2008_CITE)."
"Thus, the multidimensional PDM scale could be further validated by applying multiple methods regarding the correlation between the decision-makers self-evaluations of multi-item measures on the one hand and third party observations, responses, or ratings on single-item measures using a different scale on the other hand ( Netemeyer_et_al.,_2003_CITE, p_80)"
"PDM should be validated as a focal construct in a nomological network with different antecedents and consequences as well as potential moderators and mediators ( Edwards,_2001;_MacKenzie,_Podsakoff,_&_Podsakoff,_2011_CITE)"
"We follow Calder,_Phillips,_and_Tybout_(1983_CITE, p_113) argument that [t]heory must be the driving force in designing theory-testing research and thus a theory can only be supported by convergence, discriminant and external validity"
"In accordance with previous literature ( eg VandenBos,_2007_CITE), we suggest that the cognitive skills can be trained or learned more easily compared to personality traits"
"Experiments on hypotheses derived by Franco and Meadows (2007) and empirical findings ( Garfield_et_al.,_2001_CITE) regarding the impact of Jung's theory of psychological types in context of PSM could be complemented by a scale that covers in particular cognitive skills and personality traits that are relevant in the generating phase in problem structuring"
"For example, Garfield_et_al._(2001)_CITE found empirical evidence that innovative, radical alternatives are created more often by intuitive and feeling individuals than by sensing and thinking individuals"
The results of Siebert_and_Keeney_(2013)_CITE indicate that using objectives enhances the quality and quantity of created alternatives
"Proactive individuals use objectives to create alternatives ( Keeney,_1992_CITE)"
"Another example is that the PDM scale may be useful to explain individual differences and conceptual modelling task performance ( Dhillon_&_Dasgupta,_2011_CITE)."
"We have already discussed the aspect that PDM may be linked to procrastination and buck-passing (defensive avoidance, Mann_et_al.,_1997_CITE; avoidant and dependent decision-making styles, Scott_&_Bruce,_1995_CITE) as well as compulsive indecisiveness ( Frost_&_Shows,_1993_CITE)"
"In our conceptualisation Section 3, we discuss the similarities and differences between proactive cognitive skills and vigilance ( Mann_et_al.,_1997_CITE), the rational thinking style ( Epstein,_1973,_1983,_1985,_1994_CITE, and 2003_CITE), and the situation specific thinking style ( Novak_&_Hoffman,_2009_CITE)"
"According to Murphy_and_Davidshofer_(1998)_CITE there is a huge need for psychological tests in practice and they defined three major fields of application for psychological testing, namely educational, personnel, and clinical testing"
"Furthermore, the results of the tests provide information on certain characteristics of the subject ( Murphy_&_Davidshofer,_1998_CITE)."
"In contrast to individual conversations, this would save time and in contrast to group discussions, the use of the PDM questionnaire would prevent single opinion leaders from dominating the results, since certain individuals often lead decisions in companies ( Crant,_1996_CITE)."
"1 1Stephen Elop, the former Executive Vice President of Microsoft's Devices and Services and (at the time of the comment) the CEO of Nokia Corporation, speech at D9, June 1, 2011 Hence, the sheer number of applications in the marketplace has become increasingly important in marketing new mobile devices (see eg, Chen,_2010;_Reuters,_2012;_Lee,_2015;_Smith,_2015_CITE)"
"The logic behind establishing the ecosystems is grounded on the theory of network externalities ( Katz_and_Shapiro,_1985_CITE)"
"Due to network externalities, a large number of application developers within the ecosystem is expected to lead to a large number of applications that, in turn, will attract customers and drive device sales, leading to a virtuous circle ( Holzer_and_Ondrus,_2011_CITE)."
"In this study, the concept of mobile application ecosystem refers to an interconnected system comprising an ecosystem orchestrator, mobile application developers, and mobile device owners, all of whom are connected through a marketplace platform ( Hyrynsalmi,_Sepp nen_and_Suominen,_2014_CITE)"
"Hence, a mobile application ecosystem is a derivate of the more general concept of a software ecosystem ( Jansen,_Finkelstein,_and_Brinkkemper,_2009;_Bosch,_2009;_Manikas_and_Hanssen,_2013_CITE)."
"The increased complexity calls for a better understanding of the boundaries and structures of the ecosystems (eg, Jansen_et_al._2009;_Gueguen_and_Isckia,_2011;_Hanssen,_2012_CITE)"
"Prior research has investigated the success factors of the iPhone ( Laugesen_and_Yuan,_2010;_West_and_Mace,_2010_CITE), the distribution and capture of value in the mobile phone supply chains ( Dedrick,_Kraemer,_and_Linden,_2011_CITE), developers perspectives on the mobile application markets ( Lee,_Lee,_Shim,_and_Choi,_2010;_Holzer_and_Ondrus,_2011;_Schultz,_Zarnekow,_Wulf,_and_Nguyen,_2011_CITE), the dynamics of the application marketplaces ( J rvi_and_Kortelainen,_2011;_Hyrynsalmi,_Suominen,_and_Sepp nen,_2013;_Jansen_and_Bloemendal,_2013_CITE), standard wars and platform battles ( Heinrich,_2014;_Gallagher,_2012;_van_de_Kaa_and_de_Vries,_2015;_van_de_Kaa,_van_den_Ende,_de_Vries_and_van_Heck,._2011_CITE) and cooperation within ecosystems ( Gueguen_and_Isckia,_2011_CITE)"
"To fill this void in the literature, this study draws on theory about platform competition ( Rochet_and_Tirole,_2003;_Armstrong,_2006;_Sun_and_Tse,_2009_CITE) and investigates application developers multi-homing (ie, the situation in which developers publish applications in two or more ecosystems) as well as the content of the most downloaded applications"
"According to the extant research, the success of network platforms, such as mobile application ecosystems, is determined by whether the market is single-homing or multi-homing in terms of volume ( Sun_and_Tse,_2009_CITE)"
"To gain a more accurate insight into the competition between software ecosystems, we advance the research on the influence of multi-homing on platform competition in two-sided markets ( Sun_and_Tse,_2009_CITE)"
"Second, we contribute to the research on competition dynamics in the telecommunications industry ( He,_Lim,_and_Wong,_2006_CITE)"
"Hence, we shed light on the bargaining powers of the nucleus developers and ecosystem orchestrators such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft that host and maintain the ecosystems ( Manikas_and_Hansen,_2013_CITE)."
"Two-sided markets are economic platforms with beneficial cross-group network effects ( Armstrong,_2006;_Rochet_and_Tirole,_2003;_Parker_and_Van_Alstyne,_2005_CITE)"
"Network effects can accrue from direct externalities, whereby utility increases as the number of users consuming increases; and indirect externalities, whereby the demand for a product depends on the existence of another product ( Katz_and_Shapiro,_1985_CITE)"
"Hence, in the mobile application ecosystems context, two-sided markets can be conceptualized as markets where one or several economic platforms enable interaction between customers, developers, and an orchestrator ( Rochet_and_Tirole,_2003,_2006;_Armstrong,_2006_CITE)."
"To date, the managerial and scholarly debate on two-sided markets has followed the logic of the credit card business, where the absolute number of merchants accepting a credit card or the number of applications available in the marketplace determines the value of the credit card for the end user (see eg, Chen,_2010;_Reuters,_2012;_Lee,_2015;_Smith,_2015_CITE)"
"Prior studies have examined winner-takes-all competition ( Eisenmann,_Parker_and_Van_Alstyne_2006_CITE), ie, a situation where one platform ultimately wins the platform race"
"Econometric modeling studies, such as Tse_(2006)_CITE and Sun_and_Tse_(2009)_CITE have created models of platform competition that emphasize the role of single- or multi-homing"
"Sellers engage in multi-homing to gain access to larger potential markets ( Rochet_and_Tirole,_2006_CITE), to offer their products to the same customers across different platforms, and to reduce dependency on a single market and orchestrator ( Idu,_van_de_Zande,_and_Jansen,_2011_CITE)"
"However, multi-homing also generates costs associated with converting a product to different platforms, additional marketing efforts, and also maintaining the product for several platforms ( Eisenmann_et_al.,_2006_CITE)."
"Prior research has focused on software vendors multi-homing in console games marketplaces ( Landsman_and_Stremersch,_2011_CITE), Software as a Service (SaaS) marketplaces ( Burkard,_Draisbach,_Widjaja,_and_Buxmann,_2011;_Burkard,_Widjaja,_and_Buxmann,_2012_CITE), and also within Apple's ecosystem ( Idu_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"In their study on the gaming console market, Landsman_and_Stremersch_(2011)_CITE found that the multi-homing of games has a negative effect on sales at the marketplace level, although the negative effect decreases when a platform matures or gains market share"
"Idu_et_al._(2011)_CITE investigated the iPhone, iPad, and Mac software marketplaces, and found that, out of the top 1,800 applications, 17.2% were multi-homed in two marketplaces and 2.1% in all three marketplaces."
"In their theoretical analysis of competitive advantage in two-sided markets, Sun_and_Tse_(2009)_CITE highlighted the importance of the distinction between multi-homing and single-homing in determining the winner among competing platforms"
"Drawing on dynamic systems models, Sun_and_Tse_(2009)_CITE argued that, in the context of single-homing, only the largest network will survive and that network size is the critical factor in determining the winner among competing platforms"
"This is due to the fact that in a two-sided market, network participants become a critical resource for the platform orchestrator ( Sun_and_Tse,_2009_CITE)"
"By drawing on two dynamic systems models, Sun_and_Tse_(2009)_CITE concluded that a multi-homing market is able to sustain several platforms, whereas a single-homing market is prone to becoming dominated by a single platform."
"However, Sun_and_Tse_(2009)_CITE pointed out that their analysis of platform competition focused on the quantity of network participants but did not address the quality of participants"
"This issue is particularly important in the context of mobile application ecosystems, since most of the installations in Google Play were generated from a small set of applications ( Hyrynsalmi,_Suominen,_M kil ,_and_Knuutila_2012_CITE)."
"(see eg, Castillo,_2004;_Olston_and_Najork,_2010_CITE) utilizing the Python programming language to gather the application data"
"As pointed out by Hyrynsalmi_et_al._(2012)_CITE, most of the installations in Google Play were generated by a small set of applications"
"Therefore, we pay special attention to this subset of applications, also referred to as superstars ( Landsman_and_Stremersch,_2011_CITE), and we consider developers of these superstar applications as the nucleus developers of the respective ecosystems"
"It should be noted that while a keystone actor, ie an active leader in the ecosystem ( Basole,_2009_CITE), can also be a nucleus developer, the opposite is seldom the case."
"This process of analyzing and coding textual data is typical for the content analysis of textual data (see eg Krippendorf,_2013_CITE)"
"Thereafter, we compare our results against prior theory on multi-homing in two-sided markets ( Sun_and_Tse_2009_CITE), and then on the often-stated argument concerning the importance of a large developer base and the volume of complementary products to the success of an ecosystem ( Cenamor_et_al.,_2013_CITE)"
"According to Sun_and_Tse's_(2009_CITE) theory of platform competition, a multi-homing market can sustain several competing ecosystems; however, a single-homing market eventually evolves into only one prevailing ecosystem"
"According to Sun_and_Tse_(2009)_CITE, this implies that the market would be able to sustain more than one ecosystem"
"As a result, we depart from Sun_and_Tse_(2009)_CITE who emphasized the sheer size of the two sides of the market as a decisive factor in platform competition"
"In addition, our findings differ from the extant research (eg, Yamakami,_2010;_Holzer_and_Ondrus,_2011;_Schultz_et_al.,_2011_CITE) that, grounded on network externalities ( Katz_and_Shapiro,_1985_CITE), somewhat simplistically argues that a large base of developers leads to a large number of applications that, in turn, leads to an increasing number of end-users, and vice versa"
"First, our observation that nucleus developers are active in multi-homing implies that the market might be able to sustain more than one ecosystem, particularly if the ecosystems are able to focus on specific customer segments and differentiate their offerings ( Kouris_and_Kleer,_2012_CITE)"
This supports the findings by Hyrynsalmi_et_al._(2013)_CITE who did not find differentiation between the consumers nor the application offerings of the ecosystems
"Furthermore, as pointed out by Hyrynsalmi_et_al._(2012)_CITE, only a small share of all applications published in the marketplace are actually downloaded, and even fewer are actually used by customers"
"With regard to the second area of future research, a business ecosystem should, among other success factors, support niche and opportunity creation ( Iansiti_and_Levien_2004_CITE)"
"Association Football (hereafter referred to as simply football) is the most popular sport internationally [10,27,11]_CITE, and attracts an increasing share of the multi-billion dollar gambling industry; particularly after its introduction online [6]_CITE"
Pope and Peel [30]_CITE evaluated a simulation of bets against published market odds in accordance with the recommendations of a panel of newspapers experts
A similar paper by Dixon and Pope [9]_CITE was also published on the basis of 1993 1996 data and reported similar results
Rue and Salvesen [32]_CITE suggested a Bayesian dynamic generalised linear model to estimate the time-dependent skills of all the teams in the English Premier League (EPL) and English Division 1
"In an attempt to exploit the favourite-longshot bias for profitable opportunities, Poisson and Negative Binomial models have been used to estimate the number of goals scored by a team [3]_CITE"
Goddard and Asimakopoulos [17]_CITE proposed an ordered probit regression model to forecast EPL match results in an attempt to test the weak-form efficiency of prices in the fixed-odds betting market
1 Using a benchmark statistical model with a large number of quantifiable variables relevant to match outcomes Forrest et al [15]_CITE examined the effectiveness of forecasts based on published odds and forecasts generated
[19]_CITE attempted to investigate the rationality of bookmakers odds using an ordered probit model to generate predictions for EPL matches
"By considering William Hill odds, they followed the betting strategy introduced in [8,9]_CITE and reported negative returns ranging from 2.5% to 15% for all discrepancy levels during seasons 2004 2006"
"[21]_CITE considered the ELO rating system for football match prediction, although it was initially developed by [12]_CITE for assessing the strength of international chess players"
"[7]_CITE recently presented a Bayesian network model that was used to generate forecasts about the EPL matches during season 2010/2011, by considering both objective and subjective information for prediction"
In this section we first provide a brief overview of the model summarising the main differences to the approach in [7]_CITE
The dynamic discretisation algorithm [28]_CITE uses entropy error as the basis for approximation
"The primary differences with the BN model proposed in [7]_CITE are: 1.P, which formulates the prior predictive distribution of S, is now measured using a straightforward Beta Binomial approach (which we describe in detail in Section 2.1 below), rather than the complex non-symmetric Bayesian parameter learning approach;2.Model components which correspond to each of the generic factors have been both decreased in number and simplified in an attempt to reduce model complexity"
For market odds we have considered the odds with the highest payoff as recorded by [14]_CITE for the matches of the EPL season 2011/2012
"However, many researchers also consider (or solely focus) on various scoring rules for this purpose in an attempt to determine the accuracy of the forecasts against the observed results [8,32,20,16,24,16,15,22,19,21]_CITE"
"The results reported in this section add further evidence of market inefficiency to an already extensive list, particularly in the presence of regular predetermined biases, arbitrage opportunities, as well as conflicting daily adjustments in published odds between firms [6]_CITE"
"The model was used to generate the match forecasts for the EPL season 2011/2012, and forecasts were published online [29]_CITE prior to the start of each match."
"This was carried out by analyzing the layout and structure of socially constructed texts of organizational communication ( Yates_&_Orlikowski,_1992_CITE) amongst people in a particular workplace or in a community of practice (CoP) as described by Wenger_(1999)_CITE, where, genre, in a textual sense, is sometimes defined as a group of texts or documents that share a communicative purpose, as determined by the discourse community which produces and/or reads them ( Swales,_1990_CITE)"
"As Yates_and_Orlikowski_(1992)_CITE stated: In structurational terms, genres are social institutions that are produced, reproduced, or modified when human agents draw on genre rules to engage in organizational communication"
"Collins,_Mulholland,_and_Watt_(2001)_CITE explained that what the community sees as important will be reflected in the implicit structures found in the objects they create and share and as Watt_(2009,_chap._8)_CITE has observed: convergence on a set of standardized document structures is both natural and helpful"
"Layout in organizational communities causes people to focus perceptually on key parts of the text ( Schmid_&_Baccino,_2002_CITE) and our empirical research has previously demonstrated that people use layout and other related cues to focus on key parts of the text ( Clark,_2008;_Clark,_Ruthven,_&_Holt,_2008;_Clark,_Ruthven,_&_Holt,_2010;_Clark,_Ruthven,_Holt,_&_Song,_2012_CITE)"
"The reader is able to perceive the meaning through interaction with the cues which exist on the outside and inside of the frame ( Frow,_2006,_chap._5_CITE) a term that Frow uses synonymously with genre"
"Is there any evidence of Frame ( Frow,_2006,_chap._5_CITE) theory (see Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 in user activities involving internal and external cues, while they are identifying the e-mails?"
Aristotle_(1954)_CITE considered that whatever was perceivable by the individual was reality
"Outside objects imposed upon the senses, and due to the power of reason, the mind was able to extricate the form, which determined the nature of the perceived object ( Breure,_2001_CITE)"
"We contend that the specific contexts of researchers guide the way they delineate genre: as Kwa nik_&_Crowston_(2005)_CITE argue, the researcher chooses the definition applicable to the current context of the study"
"When we perceive and interrelate with any object, in this context a book or textual document, we view in an unconscious (a misnomer in a real sense because in cognitive science it is described as attention and awareness) or conscious sense for the elements of background informations that are evoked by texts and generically shaped and specific ( Frow,_2006,_chap._5_CITE)"
"This is quite closely related to Semiotic intertextuality a term that is said to have been coined by the post-structuralist semiotician, Kristeva_(1980)_CITE"
"In fact, texts owe more to other texts than to their own makers ( Chandler,_2011_CITE)."
Beebee_(1994)_CITE states that genre is primarily the precondition for the creation and the reading of texts and literary learning or academic research is secondary
"Extending Beebee idea, Frow believes that interpretation is led by genre due to the constriction of the process of signs (semiotics) and the production of meaning ( Frow,_2006,_chap._5_CITE)"
Lorch_(1989)_CITE believes that the text provides signals (writing devices) which emphasize the text content and structure
"Hirsch_Jr._(1967,_p._76)_CITE, explains that genre is an interpretative process called into being by the fact that all understanding of verbal meaning is necessarily genre-bound"
"Basically, when we deduce the genre of a text or what kind of thing this is ( Frow,_2006,_chap._5_CITE) our guess stays the same until the initial interpretation is reformed because of an event which allows the viewer to re-evaluate the understanding of the meaning"
"Hirsch explanation could be appropriately linked to the work pertaining to perceptual hypotheses by Gregory_(1980)_CITE or, indeed, as we like to refer to it, perpetual perceptual hypotheses, where we are continuously trying to ascertain what an object or text is"
"The cues (or metacommunications) of the frame offer the reader/viewer specific options with regard to the following questions: how can I use the text?; What can I expect to occur at different stages?; what can I do if my expectations are not fulfilled? The cues encountered can either be internal to the text or external: located at the margins of texts ( Frow,_2006,_p._104,_chap._5_CITE)"
"Genette_(1997,_p._1)_CITE has highlighted examples of external cues (or paratexts) that surround a literary text, for example, the name of the author, the title, the foreword, the figures or tables within the text"
"Lorch_(1989)_CITE identifies textual signals, such as headings, previews, summaries, titles, numeric signals and so on"
"For the purpose of this study, genre was defined by its purpose (sometimes known as substance) but mainly by form (see Fig_2 for categories of form) as described in Dewdney,_VanEss-Dykema,_&_MacMillan_(2001)_CITE and Yates_&_Orlikowski_(2002,_p._15)_CITE"
"The constructivists defend a top-down approach, according to which perception leads to recognition, ie, the perceiver uses sensory information, and builds or constructs this incomplete information to make sense of it ( Braisby_&_Gellatly,_2005_CITE)"
"Ecologists (Gibson and others) believe in an alternative and direct (bottom-up) framework for perception and Gibson, heavily influenced by Gestalt theories, not only challenged the stages but also introduced the notion of affordance (see Section 3.3 below) as a centerpiece for his theories and the Ambient Optical Array ( Gibson,_1986_CITE)."
"The constructivists assert that the final goal in the perception process is recognition which would require intense cognitive processing, for example, Gregory_(1980)_CITE and his theory of perceptual hypothesis"
"With such a large volume of material accessible from the World Wide Web, there is an urgent need to increase our knowledge of factors influencing reading from screen ( Dyson_&_Haselgrove,_2001_CITE)."
"Many consider skimming and scanning to be techniques related to searching as opposed to strategies for reading, for example, Just_&_Carpenter_(1987)_CITE"
Though scanning of course has some relevance to reading it is conducted at a faster speed than normal reading Rayner_(1998)_CITE
As Cole_et_al._(2010)_CITE found different tasks during reading comportment enabled the switching between skimming and reading behavior and are inherent indicators of the present task
Scanning as described in Liversedge_&_Findlay_(2000)_CITE helpfully is: a sequential attention scanning of elements
"Masson_(1983)_CITE describes skimming for most of us, rapid reading involves some form of skimming in which we try to focus on information relevant to our goal and skip over irrelevant information"
Holmqvist_et_al._(2011)_CITE suggests that a sequence of long saccades is likely to reflect skimming over the text
"As Rayner_(2009,_pp._1484)_CITE points out, equivalents between visual search and scene perception are greater than with reading, in that visual saliency plays a greater role in directing fixations"
"In each case, different ocular behavior would be expected Rayner_(2009,_pp._1484)_CITE"
"Many methodologies and algorithms have been devised for the detection of reading, firstly for a baseline, then secondly, comparing those results to other data to detect skimming, scanning or both, for example Campbell_&_Maglio_(2001),_Buscher,_Dengel,_van_Elst,_&_Mittag_(2008),_and_Buscher,_Dengel,_&_van_Elst_(2008)_CITE"
"However, the definitions of scanning and skimming may differ slightly amongst these authors and those cited, for example, in Campbell_&_Maglio_(2001)_CITE skimming is defined as cognitively medium interest and scanning is low interest"
"One main contention of this research is that an important aspect of the document structure, ie, the layout or genre, is understated when considering the ocular behaviors in previous reading detection, skimming and scanning and comprehension experiments, for example, Just_&_Carpenter_(1987),_Just,_Carpenter,_&_Woolley_(1982),_and_Masson_(1982,_1983)_CITE."
"In Watt_(2009,_p._171,_chap._8)_CITE he opines, genres behave as affordances and in essence can be filtered and categorized by form."
"Gibson affordances are intended to describe how meaning and perception are inter-related: he argues in Gibson_(1986,_p._127)_CITE that instead of perceiving objects (for example, texts) and then adding meaning later, there are visual combinations of invariant and distinctive characteristics of objects which provide cues on how to act and behave in relation to these objects (in this case textual e-mails)"
"In addition to the issue of investigating features (or invariants) there is also a case for exploring the possible actions which are afforded to the perceiver of documents; this is one of the main tenets of Gibsonian theory: perception for action ( Gibson,_1986_CITE)"
"Alternatively, Toms_&_Campbell_(1999b)_CITE, in their study, leaned towards the Constructivist (perception for recognition) process, since they aimed to contrast the content (function) and form in order to discover whether readers can perceive and process form on its own or need semantic content to identify it"
Toms_&_Campbell_(1999a)_CITE contended that the attributes of a document genre enable it to be specifically identified and showed that genre features play a significant role in recognizing documents
"In Toms_&_Campbell_(1999b)_CITE they performed experiments using form and function (content or purpose), exposing users, with backgrounds in IT and an academic environment, to digital and hard copies of web documents"
"When the document structure was shown, however, Toms_&_Campbell_(1999b,_p._2014)_CITE stated that: participants had to match their sensory response with the corresponding representation stored in long-term memory"
"They argue that their results show that perception is a top-down process, in contrast to the Ecological bottom-up process, where the readers recognize the genres through the attributes of the layout which forms the basis of document recognition (or perception for recognition), and although Toms and Campbell, like Lakoff_(1987)_CITE, refer to the bottom-up process and suggest that genres may act as a single gestalt Toms_&_Campbell_(1999a,_p._2015)_CITE they do not explore other possibilities, such as perception for action and how a genre is perceived when the document is displayed to a reader (in all fairness Watt_(2009,_chap._8)_CITE also fails to explore the perception for recognition concept)"
"In their conclusions, however, Toms_&_Campbell_(1999a,_p._2015)_CITE query how the form of the document affects a user in the first few seconds of the interaction and this begs the question: how do the form features of a genre aid in text interpretation and use? This is one of the questions that forms a central part of our research."
"In a later study, Toms_(2001)_CITE claims that form is important but reinforces her perceptual claims by explaining: because the unique shape triggers a user mental model of that class of genre"
"Although the research carried out by Toms_&_Campbell_(1999a,_1999b),_Toms,_Campbell,_&_Blades_(1999),_Toms_(2001)_CITE, and then Watt_(2009,_chap._8)_CITE, seems to indicate a leaning towards one process or another (Watt Ecological and Toms Constructivist) the latter does explore Ecological in her thesis ( Toms,_1997_CITE), it may emerge that they are both correct (or indeed wrong), but for different information searching tasks and in different contexts"
"The scanpath mirrors clearly the unfolding of visual attention over time and indicates which features or contents in a visual context are attended ( Coco,_2009_CITE)"
"The movement represented by these scanpaths are not random, rather they reflect the viewer frame of mind, expectations and purpose ( Yarbus,_1967_CITE)"
"Measurements of observed scanpaths have been used in a multitude of different domains, such as, dyslexia research ( Adler-Grinberg_&_Stark,_1978_CITE), cognitive computation ( Humphrey_&_Underwood,_2011_CITE) and social phobias/anxiety disorders ( Horley,_Williams,_Gonsalvez,_&_Gordon,_2003_CITE) and so on"
Goldberg_&_Kotval_(1999)_CITE conducted computer interface evaluations with twelve participants testing the interfaces whilst analyzing their scanpath behavior
"Goldberg,_Stimson,_Lewenstein,_Scott,_&_Wichansky_(2002)_CITE set out to evaluate specific design features for a prototype web portal application using scanpaths, etc"
"Joachims,_Granka,_Pan,_Hembrooke,_&_Gay_(2005)_CITE used scanpath measurements to examine the reliability of implicit feedback generated from click through data in Web searches"
Brandt_&_Stark_(1997)_CITE showed their participants visual imagery of irregularly-chequered diagrams
The experimental eyetracking data was input into the SPSS software along with the data used in Clark_et_al._(2010)_CITE and then statistically evaluated
"Saccades, as stated in Holmqvist_et_al._(2011,_pp._23)_CITE, The rapid motion of the eye from one fixation to another (from word to word in reading, for instance) is called a saccade"
"A formula (see Figs_5 and 6, and originally by Goldberg_&_Kotval_(1999,_pp._638)_CITE) for each metric was implemented to compute the means for the lengths and durations"
"Secondly, the experimental eyetracking scanpath data was then collated with the data used in Clark_et_al._(2010)_CITE 2mean fixation durations, mean fixation counts saccade lengths and saccadic regressions"
"A function was then implemented using the formulae shown in the Figures in Goldberg_&_Kotval_(1999,_p._638)_CITE to calculate Length ( Fig_5) and Duration ( Fig_6.)"
"If this had occurred, it would have shown up in the data obtained from Clark_et_al._(2010)_CITE ie the time taken to make an identification"
"We adopted the mode switch scoring system using pooled evidence described in Table 1 of Campbell_&_Maglio_(2001,_p._3)_CITE to identify any changes of mode (scanning or skimming) within a tokenized stream of eye-movement data Campbell_&_Maglio_(2001,_p._3)_CITE."
"It should be noted that for the setting of the parameters, some research was necessary: first of all, we looked at the fixation duration descriptions found in Table 1 of Rayner_(1998)_CITE who states that during the reading process, the fixation duration averages between 225 and 250 ms"
"Thirdly, like Campbell_&_Maglio_(2001)_CITE, the data was quantized by averaging the gaze points from 60 Hz per second to 20 Hz per second"
"The use of skimming and scanning techniques was detected by referring to the 20 possible permutations found in Campbell_&_Maglio_(2001,_p._3)_CITE and Buscher,_Dengel,_van_Elst,_and_Mittag_(2008)_CITE scoring was based on the short, medium or long movements, which were given a particular score whenever they occurred on the X or Y axes gaze point"
"Our scoring system differed from that shown in Table 1 in Campbell_&_Maglio_(2001,_p._3)_CITE: we used the term skimming to refer to the long movement mentioned by Campbell and scanning to refer to the short movement"
"According to Campbell_&_Maglio_(2001,_p._3)_CITE, a positive number is evidence that reading has taken place and a negative number is evidence of, skimming"
"To test these, we followed the same data formatting approach previously used in Toms_&_Campbell_(1999b)_CITE, and later e-mail work by Watt_(2009,_chap._8)_CITE"
"In this analysis, we are still asking the original questions from Clark_(2008)_and_Clark_et_al._(2008,_2009b,_2010)_CITE, but we are also extending the scope of the questions shown in Section 1."
"The scanpath duration measure is used to see how much time participants spend on processing information and complexity Goldberg_&_Kotval_(1999,_p._638)_CITE; a longer scanpath duration indicates participants are spending more time processing information and hence classifying information is far more intensive"
"For information search tasks, the ideal scanpath is a straight line to the target, with relatively short fixation duration at the target Goldberg_&_Kotval_(1999,_p._638)_CITE"
"Since the scanpaths are formed by computing the fixations and saccades, this allowed us to make inferences about the allocation of the user attention ie cognitive processing to the stimuli Goldberg_&_Kotval_(1999,_p._638)_CITE"
"However, there were dissimilarities between participants at the feature level, which as Toms_&_Campbell_(1999b)_CITE found precludes the specification of an exclusive parsimonious set of attributes per genre"
The evidence in the data shown in Tables 6 8 in Clark_et_al._(2010)_CITE and collected here indicates a higher level of fixations and the longest scanpaths for the e-mails only represented by form with no content
Cross-comparison with Table 6 in Clark_et_al._(2010)_CITE revealed that the scanpaths for this representation were the longest overall (1822) dominated by fixations (mean count 8.09)
"Cross-comparison with the e-mail genres, ( Table 6 in Clark_et_al._(2010)_CITE), revealed that the calls for papers, newsletters and spam had the highest level of fixations and longest scanpaths overall"
"This is indicative of the scanpath containing more saccades than fixations, especially if cross-referenced with saccades per second, as shown in Table 8 in Clark_et_al._(2010)_CITE."
"Is there any evidence of Frow_(2006,_pp._103 109,_chap._5)_CITE Frame theory (see 2.1.2 ) in user activities involving internal and external cues, while they are identifying the e-mails? The types of cues used by our participants have reinforced the ideas put forward by Frow_(2006,_chap._5)_CITE and also Genette_(1997,_p._1)_CITE"
"Interestingly enough, however, by cross-referencing of the data in Clark_et_al._(2010)_CITE, such as mean fixation durations and the scanpath data in SPSS did not reveal any particular patterns between the scanpath metrics and familiarity"
"Thus, the proposal for concept similarity models to estimate the degree of similarity between word and concept pairs has been a very active line of research in the fields of cognitive sciences [106,124]_CITE, artificial intelligence and Information Retrieval (IR) [107]_CITE"
"For this reason [57,_ 1.1]_CITE, ontology-based semantic similarity measures exclusively based on is-a relationships are currently the best and most reliable strategy to estimate the degree of similarity between words and concepts [58]_CITE, whilst the corpus-based similarity measures are the best strategy for estimating their degree of relatedness [8]_CITE."
"For instance, in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and IR, ontology-based semantic similarity measures have been used in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods [92]_CITE, text similarity measures [86]_CITE, spelling error detection [20]_CITE, sentence similarity models [44,66,91]_CITE, paraphrase detection [36]_CITE, unified sense disambiguation methods for different types of structured sources of knowledge [73]_CITE, document clustering [31]_CITE, ontology alignment [30]_CITE, document [74]_CITE and query anonymization [11]_CITE, clustering of nominal information [9,10]_CITE, chemical entity identification [40]_CITE, interoperability among agent-based systems [34]_CITE, and ontology-based Information Retrieval (IR) models [55,62]_CITE to solve the lack of an intrinsic semantic distance in vector ontology-based IR models [23]_CITE"
"In the field of bioengineering, ontology-based similarity measures have been proposed for synonym recognition [24]_CITE and biomedical text mining [14,98,112]_CITE"
"Many GO-based semantic similarity measures have been proposed for protein functional similarity [28,29,101,132]_CITE, giving rise to applications in protein classification and protein-protein interactions [41,129]_CITE, gene proritization [117]_CITE and many others reported in [76,_p.2]_CITE."
"In another subsequent work [56]_CITE, the same aforementioned authors introduce a new family of intrinsic and corpus-based IC models and a new algebraic framework for their derivation, which is based on the estimation of the conditional probabilities between child and parent concepts within a taxonomy"
Another significant example of caching is the approach adopted by the WNetSS semantic measures library introduced recently by Aouicha et al [15]_CITE
"This latter caching strategy based on MySQL could be appropiate for supporting a large Web-based experimental platform, such as the SISR system proposed in [15]_CITE"
"This latter software design decision looks fine from an abstract point of view; however, it hinders the implementation of weighted IC-based measures like the weighted J&C and coswJ&C similarity measures introduced by Lastra-D az and Garc a-Serrano [57]_CITE, because the edge weights depend on the IC values of the nodes."
"Many works introducing similarity measures or IC models during the last decade have only implemented or evaluated classic IC-based similarity measures, such as the Resnik [108]_CITE, Lin [70]_CITE and Jiang-Conrath [52]_CITE measures, avoiding the replication of IC models and similarity measures introduced by other researchers"
"Pedersen [94]_CITE, and subsequently Fokkens et al [37]_CITE, warn of the need to reproduce and validate previous methods and results reported in the literature, a suggestion that we subscribe to in our aforementioned works [56 58]_CITE, where we also refuted some previous conclusions and warn of finding some contradictory results"
"A recent study [6,33]_CITE on the perception of this reproducibility crisis in science shows that the aforementioned reproducibility problems in our area are not the exception but the rule"
"Precisely, this latter fact has encouraged the recent manifesto for reproducible science [90]_CITE, which we also subscribe."
"For example, the node depth can be defined as the shortest ascending path length from the node to the root, or the longest ascending path length as defined by Taieb et al [43]_CITE"
"On the other hand, the computation of the hyponym set, subsumed leaves and subsumer set requires a careful counting process to avoid node repetitions, as is already noted in [119,_ 3]_CITE"
"However, in [43]_CITE, the hyponym set also includes the base concept"
"Stanchev [122]_CITE introduces an assymmetric similarity weighted graph derived from WordNet, whilst Mart nez-Gil [75]_CITE proposes an aggregated similarity measure based on a combination of multiple ontology-based similarity measures and Van Miltenburg [125]_CITE proposes a method to compute the semantic similarity between adjectives based on the use of the similarity between their sets of derivational source names in WordNet"
"More recently, Meymandpour et al [85]_CITE propose several semantic similarity measures for Linked Open Data (LOD) based on IC models, whilst Batet and S nchez [13]_CITE propose a semantic relatedness measure based on the combination of highly-accurate ontology-based semantic similarity measures with a resemblance measure derived from corpus statistics."
"WS4J includes, like its parent library, the most significant path-based similarity measures, the three aforementioned classic IC-based measures and several corpus-based IC models [95]_CITE"
"WNSim has been used in a series of papers on word similarity by Patwardhan and Pedersen [93,96]_CITE, and it has been extended in order to support the UMLS biomedical ontology, thus becoming an independent Perl software library called UMLS::Similarity [78]_CITE, which is used in a WSD evaluation by McInnes et al [77]_CITE"
"However, there are many other libraries and tools exclusively focused on Gene Ontology (GO), as detailed by Mazandu et al [76]_CITE, which should be considered in this specific domain"
"Finally, we have the WNetSS semantic measures library introduced recently by Aouicha et al [15]_CITE, which is based on an off-line pre-processing and caching in a MySQL server of WordNet, as well as all WordNet-based topological features and implemented IC models"
"Mendling et al [80]_CITE study the current practices in the activity labeling of business processes, whilst Dijkman et al [32]_CITE propose a similarity metric between business process models based on an ad-hoc semantic similarity metric between words in the node labels and attributes, as well as the structural similarity encoded by the concept map topology"
"Likewise, Leopold et al [68]_CITE propose an automatic refactoring method of activity labels in business process modeling based on the automatic recognition of labeling styles, and Leopold et al [67]_CITE propose the inference of suitable names for business process models automatically"
"Finally, Montani and Leonardi [89]_CITE introduce a framework for the retrieval and clustering of process models based on a semantic and structural distance between models"
"HESML V1R2 [60]_CITE is distributed as a Java class library ( HESML-V1R2.jar) plus a test driver application ( HESMLclient.jar), which have been developed using NetBeans 8.0.2 for Windows, although it has been also compiled and evaluated on Linux-based platforms using the corresponding NetBeans versions"
"HESML V1R2 is freely distributed for any non-commercial purpose under a Creative Commons By-NC-SA-4.0 license 2 2HYPERLINK recognized by citing the present work, whilst the commercial use of the similarity measures introduced in [57]_CITE, as well as part of the intrinsic IC models introduced in [56]_CITE and [58]_CITE, is protected by a patent application [58]_CITE"
HESML is currently being evaluated by Castellanos et al [22]_CITE in a taxonomy recovering task from DBpedia based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) methods like the proposed ones in [21]_CITE
HESML V1R2 significantly improves the performance of the HESML V1R1 version [59]_CITE which was released on September 7 2016 with the original submission of this work.
"HESML V1R2 currently supports the WordNet taxonomy, most ontology-based similarity measures and all the IC models for concept similarity reported in the literature with the only exception of the IC models introduced by Harispe et al [46]_CITE, although the latter IC model could be included in future versions"
"In addition to the aforementioned IC models [46]_CITE, Seddiqui and Aono [120]_CITE and Pirr and Euzenat [104]_CITE propose two further intrinsic IC models not implemented by HESML which are based on the integration of all types of taxonomical relationships, and thus especially designed for semantic relatedness measures"
"In addition, we plan to provide ongoing support for further ontologies such as Wikidata [126]_CITE and the Gene Ontology (GO) [5]_CITE among others, as well as further similarity and relatedness measures"
"PosetHERep is based on our adaptation of the well-known half-edge representation in the field of computational geometry [19]_CITE, also known as a double-connected edge list [17,_ _2.2]_CITE, in order to efficiently represent and interrogate large taxonomies."
"The functionality and software architecture of HESML allow the efficient and practical evaluation of large word similarity benchmarks such as SimLex [50]_CITE and ontology-based similarity measures based on the length of the shortest path, whose implementation in other software libraries requires a high computational cost that prevents their evaluation in large experimental surveys [58]_CITE and datasets"
"Thus, HESML is an essential tool for allowing the fast prototyping and evaluation of new path-based similarity measures on weighted taxonomies or other complex taxonomical features, such as the measures introduced in [57]_CITE."
"All the experiments compute the Pearson and Spearman correlation metrics for a set of ontology-based similarity measures on each word similarity benchmark shown in table 22, as detailed in [56]_CITE"
"There are two different ways of obtaining the HESML source code: (1) by downloading the current version from the permanent Mendeley Data link [60]_CITE; and finally, (2) by downloading it from its GitHub repository detailed in table 8."
This folder contains the full WordNet-InfoContent-3.0 collection of WordNet-based frequency files created by Ted Pedersen [95]_CITE
"The readme file details the method used to build the frequency files, which is also detailed in [97]_CITE."
"Table 11shows the full collection of reproducible experiment files, as well as the corresponding output files that will be generated in order to reproduce the results reported in [57]_CITE, [56]_CITE and [58]_CITE respectively."
"There are two ways of running the accompanying reproducible experiments: (1) by compiling HESML and running the HESMLclient program with any input experiment file shown in table 11, as detailed in section 4.3.1; or (2) by running the HESMLv1r1_reproducible_exps.rpz reproducible experiment file [64]_CITE based on ReproZip, as detailed in section 4.3.4"
These experiment files reproduce most results reported in [56 58]_CITE
"Finally, the WNSimRepv1 dataset [63]_CITE can be computed automatically by running the command in step 4 below"
"These scripts take the raw output files generated by the experiments in table 11 and produce the final assembled tables as shown in [56 58]_CITE, as well asfigures 2 and 3 showing the interval significance analysis in [56]_CITE"
"ReproZip is a virtualization tool introduced by Chirigati et al [27]_CITE, whose aim is to warrant the exact replication of experimental results onto a different system from that originally used in their creation"
The ReproZip program was used for recording and packaging the running of the HESMLclient program with all the reproducible experiments shown in table 11 in the HESMLv1r1_reproducible_exps.rpz file available at [64]_CITE
"Because of the lack of space, WNSimRep v1 is detailed in a complementary paper, which together with the dataset files, is publicly available at [63]_CITE"
"All the corpus-based IC models are derived from the family of *add1.dat WordNet-based frequency files included in the [95]_CITE dataset, which is a dataset of corpus-based files created for a series of papers on similarity measures in WordNet, such as [93]_CITE and [96]_CITE"
The dataset includes all the IC models and similarity measures evaluated in the experimental surveys carried-out in the three aforementioned works by Lastra-D az and Garc a-Serrano in [56 58]_CITE.
"Our experiments compare the performance of the HESML V1R2 library version available at [60]_CITE, with the SML 0.9 library version whose source files are available at GitHub 6 6HYPERLINK, and the recent WNetSS library 7 7HYPERLINK"
"On the other hand, in order to evaluate and compare the performance of WNetSS with HESML and SML, we compare the running-time of the three libraries in the evaluation of the Jiang-Conrath similarity measure [52]_CITE with the Seco et al IC model [119]_CITE in the SimLex665 dataset [50]_CITE."
"All benchmarks detailed in table 17 are implemented on a single Java console program called HESML_VS_SML_test.jar, which is publicly available at [61]_CITE"
"In order to reproduce our benchmarks and see the results reported in tables 20 and 21 , and figure 3 , you should follow the steps detailed in [61]_CITE."
"We have introduced a new and linearly scalable representation model for large taxonomies, called PosetHERep, and the HESML V1R2 [60]_CITE semantic measures library based on the former"
"In addition, we have introduced a set of reproducible experiments based on ReproZip [64]_CITE and HESML, which corresponds to the experimental surveys introduced by Lastra-D az and Garc a-Serrano in [57]_CITE, [56]_CITE and [58]_CITE, as well as the WNSimRep v1 replication framework and dataset [63]_CITE and a benchmark of semantic measures libraries [61]_CITE."
"As forthcoming activities, we plan to extend HESML in order to support Wikidata [126]_CITE and non is-a relationships in the short term, whilst in the mid term, we expect to support the Gene Ontology (GO), MeSH and SNOMED-CT ontologies"
"Due to the burgeoning proliferation of communicative and network-enabled technology, the likelihood of being interrupted by a computer-based update, advertisement or message has never been so high (eg, [27,38]_CITE)"
We often take it for granted that such updates will occur and their common use in software update processes means that the majority of these communications are likely to be considered legitimate [4]_CITE
"However, fraudulent computer-based messages continue to proliferate, exploiting common influence techniques to increase the likelihood that people will click on malicious links or downloads [1]_CITE"
"These techniques include instilling a sense of urgency in recipients, mimicking reputable institutions or familiar communications, and using the threat of loss in their communications, such as account closure or system shut down [6,36,44]_CITE."
"The majority of computer-based influence techniques rely on well-documented heuristics and biases present in human decision-making [19]_CITE, such as the tendency to consider communications to be truthful rather than deceptive [21]_CITE and to make judgements based on emotional responses such as fear or panic (known as the affect heuristic)"
"This includes the recently proposed Suspicion, Cognition and Automaticity Model relating to judgements of phishing e-mails (SCAM; [42]_CITE), the Staged Model of Trust [34]_CITE, and the Integrated Information Processing Model of Phishing Susceptibility [41]_CITE"
"Research examining what makes people susceptible to malicious influence in online environments has focused primarily on phishing e-mails and e-commerce environments [36,41]_CITE"
"Overall, findings suggest that people use particular informational cues, such as the message source and inaccurate spelling or grammar to determine message legitimacy [8,17]_CITE, with factors such as degree of understanding of the internet contributing to individual differences in susceptibility [8,16]_CITE"
"Attempts to understand how fraudulent online messages affect response behaviour have led to the development of phishing susceptibility models such as the SCAM [42]_CITE, which are based on existing theories regarding how information is processed within cognitive systems (eg, Heuristic-Systematic Model, [9,39]_CITE)"
"The SCAM suggests that heuristic processing is a crucial factor in susceptibility to fraudulent e-mails, with people who engage in more automatic forms of message processing being less likely to notice errors or inconsistencies within the message and instead responding to other aspects of message content such as the influence techniques used [41]_CITE"
"These heuristic forms of processing are considered to be the predominant processing mechanism, due to the relative ease with which they are invoked [46]_CITE"
The failure of decision-makers to adequately direct attentional resources and elaborate sufficiently on inconsistencies in the message source is addressed in the Integrated Information Processing Model of Phishing Susceptibility [41]_CITE
"However, attention to urgency cues increased it due to such information monopolising available cognitive resources [41]_CITE"
"Similarly, when considering the credibility of e-health websites, Sillence et al [34]_CITE found that individuals rely on an initial heuristic screening of relatively superficial factors, such as design appeal, when making decisions, reflecting an initial trust of information"
"People have been found to generally trust information in their surrounding environment unless they have a specific reason to doubt its legitimacy [3,6]_CITE"
"This truth bias is well established in the inter-personal deception literature and has recently been expanded in Truth Default Theory [21]_CITE, which suggests that for this default truth state to be temporarily abandoned, trigger events, such as a projected motive for deception, incoherent message content, or cues associated with dishonesty, are required"
"People have been found to vary in their propensity to trust others [22]_CITE, with dispositional trust tentatively linked with the ability to accurately differentiate legitimate and phishing e-mails [14]_CITE"
"In line with phishing susceptibility models (eg, [41,42]_CITE), it is possible that trust decreases the likelihood of identifying inconsistencies within messages due to a failure to direct attention to authenticity information, or, because of inconsistencies attributed to other causes"
"For instance, when presented with photographs of faces, older adults have been found to be less adept at identifying cues of dishonesty; a finding that is suggested to account for their increased trust and resultant susceptibility to fraud [4]_CITE"
"Although such findings suggest that dispositional trust will influence susceptibility to fraudulent computer messages, scenario-specific trust related to online communication may have a greater impact on actual susceptibility [43]_CITE and these relationships are explored in the current study."
"Specifically, we utilise a task interruption approach that is known to be cognitively demanding (eg, [28]_CITE), whereby participants complete a serial recall working memory task and are interrupted during this task by computer updates of varying degrees of authenticity purporting to require critical action"
"Serial recall tasks typically involve trying to remember a sequence of items, usually six to nine numbers, letters, or both and place a high demand on verbal phonological working memory (see [2]_CITE)"
"The extent that participants are susceptible to responding to fraudulent messages heuristically may also be impacted by individual differences in dispositional trust and self-control [12,23,24,32]_CITE"
"People who show a high propensity to trust may consider messages as more likely to be genuine [14]_CITE and therefore will be less likely to actively search for, or evaluate, inconsistencies that suggest a message is illegitimate"
"Previous literature in relation to influence also suggests that participants with lower levels of self-control, and higher levels of impulsivity and sensation-seeking, will be more susceptible to negative urgency-based influence techniques, due to an increased likelihood of responding before potential inconsistencies have been identified [12,40]_CITE"
"Factors included in the SCAM [42]_CITE suggest that the presence of influence techniques may override authenticity cues in participant decision making and this may combine with themes related to participant knowledge, perception of threat (both in relation to accepting and declining updates), and their usual norms of behaviour, to impact on decision making"
"For measures of the disruption caused by interruptions, this number was adequate to detect a small to medium effect size (Cohen's f = 0.1 0.25) with power of 0.8 (determined using G*Power 3.1.7 software; [10]_CITE)"
"The primary serial recall and secondary interrupting message tasks were programmed using PsychoPy ( HYPERLINK: [32]_CITE), an open-source experiment generation software package"
"Of the 36 trials, nine contained an interruption message, representing 25% of all trials in order to reduce the frequency and predictability of interruptions for participants [29]_CITE"
The Brief Self-Control Scale is a 13-item self-report measure designed to measure trait self-control and the Cronbach's alpha for this questionnaire has been reported as 0.89 (BSCS; [37]_CITE)
The NEO Trust facet is a 10-item self-report measure designed to measure generic propensity to trust and the Cronbach's alpha for this questionnaire has been reported as between 0.82 and 0.88 on internet and field samples [18]_CITE
It is designed to measure trait impulsivity and the Cronbach's alpha for this questionnaire has been reported as 0.82 in testing with undergraduate students (BIS; [30]_CITE)
"Finally, the Brief Sensation-Seeking Scale is an 8-item self-report measure designed to measure trait sensation-seeking and the Cronbach's alpha for this questionnaire has been reported as 0.74 (BSSS; [15]_CITE)"
"Effect sizes were determined using Cohen's d for t-tests (with 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 indicating small, medium and large effect sizes respectively) and Cohen's f for F tests (with 0.1, 0.25 and 0.4 indicating small, medium and large effect sizes) [45]_CITE."
"However, participants were still significantly more likely to decline low authority updates during the questionnaire phase of the study, suggesting that greater systematic processing aids in the identification of these particular cues [41,42]_CITE."
"This suggests that low authority messages disrupt performance to a greater degree than messages that appear genuine due to the triggering of suspicion and the resultant requirement to invoke more systematic processing of message content, enabling further consideration of the lack of authority cues and hence whether the message should be declined due to potential illegitimacy [21,42]_CITE ( Fig_4)."
"Taken together, these findings suggest that heuristic processing strategies were utilised during the serial recall phase of the experiment, resulting in errors contained within mimicked authority messages not being identified, and such messages being processed and accepted to the same degree as genuine authority messages [41]_CITE"
"Interestingly, the lack of authority information contained within low authority messages seemed to invoke deeper processing strategies that were both more time-consuming and had a greater impact on resultant task performance, likely due to the triggering of suspicion [21]_CITE"
"Since authority cues have been highlighted as a key factor in determining online credibility [11]_CITE, the lack of sender details in low authority messages likely resulted in participants taking longer to consider the possibility that these updates may not be genuine"
"This may lead to a greater degree of suspicion being invoked, reducing the degree of initial trust otherwise experienced in online communications [34]_CITE."
"Conversely, individuals who are more suspicious may prioritise accepting such updates in order to counter any potential threats that they perceive [22]_CITE."
This suggests that Hypothesis 2a is supported when context-specific conceptualisations of trust are invoked [43]_CITE
"This suggests that increased trust may increase susceptibility to fraudulent cues that others identify more easily (ie, a lack of authority cues), even in contexts where systematic processing is more likely [4]_CITE"
"A lack of sender information could, therefore, either (a) be less likely to be noticed by more trusting individuals due to differences in attention direction processes, in line with heuristic defaults, or (b) not be considered a threat even if it is noticed, with differential threat perceptions resulting in a failure of identified information to trigger suspicion in line with the mechanisms of Truth Default Theory [21]_CITE"
"The ability of urgency cues to attract and monopolise attentional resources has been discussed in previous theoretical models of susceptibility [41]_CITE, with heuristic processing strategies considered to increase the likelihood that greater emphasis will be placed on influence-related message content at the expense of authenticity information"
Linking communications with authority figures is an established influence technique that exploits the tendency for individuals to comply with authority requests and its use has been found to impact on the relative effectiveness of genuine malware warnings [25]_CITE
"Similar to exploiting authority references, placing individuals under a time pressure and instilling a sense of urgency when making a decision is a technique that can be found in a number of scam communications [36]_CITE"
"A small number of respondents also referenced their usual behaviour when responding to similar messages in the past, supporting elements of the SCAM [42]_CITE related to the role of habitual and routine behaviour on judgements"
"This suggests that the presence of influence techniques such as threat of loss and urgency can still provide a valid reason to respond to fraudulent messages, supporting the findings of work by Vishwanath et al [41]_CITE that influence cues may be processed to the detriment of authenticity cues."
"Current models of susceptibility to fraudulent communications (eg, [42]_CITE) should therefore consider that (a) the threshold of potential trigger points is likely to vary according to both the cognitive context of the individual and the particular influence techniques used within the message, and (b) certain influence techniques may prove more resistant than others to systematic processing strategies"
"Therefore, a consideration of the relative role of message factors should be incorporated into susceptibility models [41,42]_CITE."
"Finally, there was tentative support for the hypothesis that individual differences in trust impact on response behaviour [14]_CITE, but this related primarily to scenario-specific conceptualisations (ie, trust in computer communications and trust in the system)"
"This suggests that in scenarios with a higher degree of cognitive pressure, individuals are equally vulnerable to being truth-biased [21]_CITE, unless fraudulent messages are particularly easy to identify, in which case a higher degree of trust may reduce the likelihood of suspicion being triggered"
"Since the appearance of any fraudulent computer message is likely to interrupt a current primary task(s), this is likely to further increase pressure on employees to respond to such notifications as quickly as possible, and therefore heuristically, in order to avoid lost productivity [35]_CITE"
"Within the serial recall task, only a small number of messages were used in order to reduce the predictability of message interruptions whilst keeping the overall serial recall task length manageable for participants (eg, [29]_CITE)"
"However, more research is required to determine the extent that the approach of this group of users (in terms of both age and gender) may differ from other demographic groups when dealing with computer security in cognitively complex conditions (eg, [16]_CITE)."
"Hopfield_and_Brody_(2000,_2001)_CITE (HB) have proposed a model for how the brain might recognize spatiotemporal patterns, and have applied it to the problem of auditory word recognition"
"Their model is particularly appealing at two different levels of analysis ( Marr_&_Poggio,_1976_CITE)."
"In the HB model synchronization arises via balanced excitation and inhibition ( Tsodyks,_Mitkov,_&_Sompolinsky,_1993_CITE) in a network of Integrate and Fire (IF) cells"
"This is particularly interesting to imaging neuroscientists as bursts of gamma activity (which we define here to be higher than 30 Hz in frequency) have been observed to accompany auditory word recognition ( Canolty_et al.,_2007;_Lutzenberger,_Pulvermuller,_&_Birbaumer,_1994;_Pulvermuller_et al.,_1996_CITE)."
"The only requirement is that the underlying neurons operate around a limit cycle and interact weakly ( Brown_et al.,_2004;_Ermentrout_&_Kleinfeld,_2001;_Hansel,_Mato,_&_Meunier,_1995_CITE)."
"It was proposed that synchronization between the relevant regions at gamma frequency was just such a mechanism ( Singer,_1999_CITE)"
"Gamma is also the single frequency band which most strongly predicts BOLD activity ( Goense_&_Logothetis,_2008_CITE)"
"In the auditory domain several studies have found stronger (25 35 Hz) gamma responses to words as opposed to pseudo-words ( Lutzenberger_et al.,_1994;_Pulvermuller_et al.,_1996_CITE) and in the 60 70 Hz range to words as opposed to non-words ( Eulitz_et al.,_1996_CITE)"
"Additionally, Canolty_et al._(2007)_CITE have found High Gamma (80 200 Hz) responses in ECOG recordings to words as opposed to non-words"
"For example, Shamir,_Ghitza,_Epstein,_and_Kopell_(2009)_CITE have developed a neurophysiologically realistic model that shows how gamma oscillations can directly represent stimuli whose time scale is longer than a single gamma cycle, as is required for the representation of auditory words"
"Hopfield_(2004)_CITE shows that subthreshold oscillations can be used to support a spike-time based code that leads to minimal interference with coexisting firing rate codes, and that subthreshold oscillations at gamma frequency may be important for encoding of speech"
This principle has been developed by Ghitza_(2007)_CITE who also propose that hierarchies of rhythms may be the mechanism by which the brain integrates information over multiple time scales during language processing.
"In neural network models with tonic drive, gap junctions can lead to synchronized gamma activity ( Pfeuty,_Mato,_Golomb,_&_Hansel,_2003_CITE)"
"Traub,_Schmitz,_Jefferys,_and_Draguhn_(1999)_CITE, have shown using simulations that a network of pyramidal cells, electrically coupled through their axons, can generate High Gamma activity without chemical synapses."
"For a pair of IF cells receiving tonic excitation, synchronization can be achieved using mutual inhibition ( Vreeswijk_et al.,_1994_CITE)"
"This result follows over to conductance-based models with large numbers of cells ( Tiesinga_&_Jose,_2000;_Wang_&_Buzsaki,_1996;_White,_Chow,_Ritt,_Soto-Trevino,_&_Kopell,_1998_CITE)"
"These network models are referred to as Inhibitory Network Gamma (ING) oscillators ( Bartos,_Vida,_&_Jonas,_2007_CITE)"
"This results in so-called Pyramidal Inhibitory Network Gamma (PING) oscillators ( Whittington,_Traub,_Kopell,_Ermentrout,_&_Buhl,_2000_CITE)."
"If cells receive different input drives then synchronization can be destroyed ( Wang_&_Buzsaki,_1996_CITE)"
"Gamma oscillations that are resistant to such inhomogeneities, however, can be generated with ING oscillators having strong rather than weak synapses, fast rather than slow synapses, and with inhibition that is shunting (ie, vetoing any excitatory input) rather than merely hyperpolarizing ( Bartos_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
"These junctions promote synchronization without changing network frequency ( Bartos_et al.,_2007_CITE)."
Brunel_and_Hakim_(1999)_CITE have investigated a different regime they call Weak Stochastic Synchronization (WSS) in which interneurons and pyramidal cells fire stochastically and during a small proportion of gamma cycles only
"This work has been extended to models with more realistic synaptic kinetics ( Brunel_&_Wang,_2003_CITE) and conductance-based models ( Geisler,_Brunel,_&_Wang,_2005_CITE)."
"There is also a body of work showing that stochastically driven Neural Mass Models ( David_&_Friston,_2003_CITE) comprising stellate cells, interneurons and pyramidal cells, can generate a range of frequencies including gamma"
"These have recently been extended by incorporating an additional population of reciprocally connected fast interneurons ( Ursino,_Cona,_&_Zavaglia,_2010_CITE)"
This section describes a spectral analysis applied to the ECOG data presented in Canolty_et al._(2007)_CITE
"Each nonword matched one of the words (action verbs) in duration, intensity and power spectrum, but was rendered unintelligible by removing components of the modulation power spectrum using the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) algorithm described in Elliott_and_Theunissen_(2009)_CITE"
"The corresponding spectrograms G(ywi,f,t) and G(yni,f,t) were then computed using a windowed multitaper method with window size N=256 samples (0.128 s), a window offset of 32 samples (0.016 s), and time-bandwidth parameter set to NW=3 ( Mitra_&_Pesaran,_1999_CITE)"
"More physiologically realistic filters can be implemented by linear spacing the filter bands on a mel-frequency scale ( Ghitza,_1986_CITE), and this was implemented for the pattern recognition results described in Section 3.1."
"Such frequency tuned onset and offset detectors have been observed in the inferior colliculus of the auditory midbrain ( Casseday_et al.,_2002_CITE)"
"Greater physiological realism can be added by using multiple level crossings to define multiple onset and offset points, as in ( Ghitza,_1986;_Gutig_&_Sompolinsky,_2009_CITE)"
"A similar encoding scheme has been proposed by Loiselle,_Rouat,_Pressnitzer,_and_Thorpe_(2005)_CITE."
"Timescales of decay range from tens of milliseconds in the auditory nerve ( Zhang,_Miller,_Robinson,_Abbas,_&_Hu,_2007_CITE) to several seconds for delay activity in frontal cortex"
"Optical imaging reveals larger time windows of temporal integration as one moves from primary to secondary auditory areas ( Harrison,_Harel,_Panesar,_Mori,_&_Mount,_2000_CITE)"
"In primary auditory cortex, Ulanovsky,_Las,_Farkas,_and_Nelken_(2004)_CITE have observed within-trial adaptation time constants, at a fast 10 ms time scale, and a slower 150 ms scale"
"It is these longer time constants that are hypothesized to be useful for auditory object recognition ( May_&_Tiitinen,_2007_CITE)."
"This is broadly consistent with electrophysiological recordings from non-human primates where representations are composed of small dynamic subsets of highly active neurons ( Hromadka,_Deweese,_&_Zador,_2008_CITE)."
"This concept is described in Abbott_(2001)_CITE, and illustrated in Fig_4"
"In the HB model it is spike timing that is synchronized and it is proposed that jopt can be learnt via spike timing dependent plasticity ( Lee,_Sen,_&_Kopell,_2009_CITE)"
"More recently, Gutig_and_Sompolinsky_(2009)_CITE have shown that this can be implemented using a conductance-based tempotron"
"Human speech is characterized by a four-fold variation in the speed at which words are spoken ( Miller,_Grosjean,_&_Lomanto,_1984_CITE), and any speech recognition system whether artificial or natural, will have to deal with this range of time-warp"
"Weakly coupled oscillators are a standard approach for studying synchronization dynamics ( Hoppensteadt_&_Izhikevich,_1997_CITE)"
"Cortical neuron models, for example, such as the Quadratic Integrate and Fire model or any model with type 1 dynamics ( Hoppensteadt_&_Izhikevich,_1997_CITE), can be implemented as a theta neuron"
"An early application, for example, used WCOs to infer that neuronal inhibition rather than excitation can cause synchronous activity ( Vreeswijk_et al.,_1994_CITE)."
"More abstract models based on WCOs have also been used as neurocognitive models of visual attention ( Corchs_&_Deco,_2001_CITE) and attention-guided object selection ( Borisyuk_&_Kazanovich,_2004_CITE)"
"In this paper we make the simplifying assumption that the Phase Interaction Function (PIF) h( )=sin( ) which results in the Global Zero Lag (GZL) solution (where all phase differences are zero ie, full synchronization), being a potential stable state of the system ( Ermentrout_&_Kleinfeld,_2001;_Penny_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"We envisage that in future work it might be possible to infer h based on neuroimaging data, an approach we have implemented for magnetoencephalograph data ( Penny_et al.,_2009_CITE)."
"Kuramoto_(1984)_CITE, for example, has derived the following result"
"In previous work we have used WCOs to study synchronization among different brain regions ( Penny_et al.,_2009_CITE) whereas in this paper we use them to model activity in a single region"
"In this paper we use g=10Hz so as to reflect typical background alpha activity ( Buzsaki,_2006_CITE)."
"The above MH criterion ensures that, after a burn in period, the algorithm produces samples from the posterior density of interest ( Gelman_et al.,_1995_CITE)"
"We now demonstrate the usefulness of Occurrence Times (OTs) as speech recognition features by comparing them to a more commonly used feature, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) ( Roweis,_1998_CITE)"
"Fig_6 shows that speech recognition performance rapidly degrades at less than 25 dB, as is well known ( Ghitza,_1986_CITE)"
"We thought it might be possible that the OT system performed better at low signal levels because it had fewer parameters than the MFCC system, and so might generalize better ( Bishop,_1995_CITE)"
"(3)), rather than more detailed IF network models ( Hopfield_&_Brody,_2001_CITE), is that they describe a similar phenomenon but are quicker to numerically integrate"
"We also compare augmented and minimal models using the model evidence, as computed using the Posterior Harmonic Mean (PHM) ( Gelman_et al.,_1995_CITE)"
"The resulting Bayes factors were 0.98 and 0.99 indicating that neither of the augmented models are significantly better than the minimal model (this would require a Bayes factor of at least three ( Gelman_et al.,_1995_CITE))."
"First, we have viewed the HB model at two separate levels of analysis; the algorithmic and implementation levels ( Marr_&_Poggio,_1976_CITE)"
"For example, an MFCC HMM system can achieve a word error rate of only 11% for connected digits in noise, with an additive noise level of 10 dB ( Lee,_Glass,_&_Ghitza,_2011_CITE)"
"A similar level of performance is obtained when using ecologically realistic noise samples from the Aurora-2 database ( Pearce_&_Hirsch,_2000_CITE)"
"We should also bear in mind, however, that our results were obtained by training the system on clean utterances whereas the results in Lee_et al._(2011)_CITE were obtained from a system trained on noisy utterances"
"An OT-Tempotron ( Gutig_&_Sompolinsky,_2009_CITE) matched the performance level of MFCC HMM approaches implemented in the HTK ( Woodland,_2003_CITE) and Sphinx 4 ( Walker_et al.,_2004_CITE) ASR systems, on noiseless isolated word recognition."
"As the way in which one cell or circuit couples with another can be summarized using phase interaction functions ( Penny_et al.,_2009_CITE) we envisage that it should be possible to identify families of neurons or neural circuits that have the appropriate synchronization properties."
"Previous studies in this area ( Corchs_&_Deco,_2004;_Husain,_Tagamets,_Fromm,_Braun,_&_Horwitz,_2004_CITE) have used computational models of auditory processing as forward models for fMRI data"
"Corchs_and_Deco_(2004)_CITE, for example, have used a neurodynamical model of feature-based attention in combination with a haemodynamic process as a forward model of fMRI activity"
Husain_et al._(2004)_CITE have taken a similar approach using a large-scale neural network of the auditory system as a model of fMRI activity
"This follows the example set by Dynamic Causal Modelling ( Friston_et al.,_2003_CITE)"
"The TS mechanism we have investigated is similar to other models of neural processing that rely on transient dynamics ( Rabinovich,_Huerta,_&_Laurent,_2008_CITE)"
"The Liquid State Machine (LSM) ( Maass,_Natschlager,_&_Markram,_2002_CITE), for example, uses OT features and the temporal embedding idea proposed in the HB model, but then applies standard methods for recognizing the resulting static patterns"
"This results in good pattern discrimination abilities ( Verstraeten_et al.,_2005_CITE), though not as accurate as a recent approach based on OT features ( Gutig_&_Sompolinsky,_2009_CITE)"
"The notion that regions higher up in the auditory cortical hierarchy process information at longer time scales has recently been made use of in a model of auditory sequence recognition based on stable heteroclinic channels ( Kiebel,_Kriegstein,_Daunizeau,_&_Friston,_2009_CITE)"
"The importance of a hierarchy of temporal scales is emphasized in recent work by Ghitza_(2011)_CITE who provides evidence that current models of speech perception, which are driven by acoustic features alone, provide an incomplete description of speech recognition phenomena"
"Whilst the work in this paper provides a useful starting point, it does not make use of the network view of brain function; Price,_Thierry,_and_Griffiths_(2005)_CITE, for example, propose that the human brain has not developed macro-anatomical structures dedicated to speech processing, but rather that speech-specific processing emerges at the level of functional connectivity among distributed regions"
"As the magnitude spectrum of speech is known to be stationary over a period of approximately twin=20 100ms ( Rabiner_&_Juang,_1993_CITE) we broke up each speech time series into frames of length twin=50ms"
"The first and second order derivatives of the MFCCs (with respect to time) are sometimes used as additional features ( Gutig_&_Sompolinsky,_2009_CITE) but did not improve recognition performance on our database."
"The possibility that synchronization increases with frequency is commensurate with in-vitro cell recordings ( Rocha,_Doiron,_Shea-Brown,_Josic,_&_Reyes,_2007_CITE) and computer simulation of both integrate and fire and Hodgkin Huxley type models ( Chawla,_Lumer,_&_Friston,_1999_CITE)."
"To overcome this impasse, there is an increasing interest in ensemble methods such as Markov state modelling [1 3]_CITE, milestoning [4]_CITE, strings using swarms [5,6]_CITE and metadynamics [7,8]_CITE"
"Peer-to-peer (p2p) networking [12]_CITE, grid computing [13 15]_CITE, and dataflow programming [16]_CITE are existing concepts that all target some of these challenges, and in combination they provide very powerful solutions."
"There are many existing grid and p2p computing implementations such as Condor [17,18]_CITE, Gnutella [19]_CITE, Boinc [20]_CITE, Dirac [21]_CITE, and Falkon [22]_CITE"
"Similarly for dataflow programming, implementations such as Naiad [23]_CITE, Flumejava [24]_CITE, Millwheel [25]_CITE, and Swift [26]_CITE provide domain-specific languages and libraries that give users the flexibility to create powerful and efficient implementations"
"As a concept, dataflow programming has mostly been orthogonal to grid or p2p computing, but systems such as Pegasus [27]_CITE, Kepler [28]_CITE, Triana [29]_CITE, and Fireworks [30]_CITE have emerged that combine them"
"MapReduce is also a beautiful example of the power in combining concepts [31]_CITE; this was originally a programming model, but today it is more coupled to distributed and cloud computing as it has been extended with a problem-aware engine that handles workload distribution automatically, and it works very well for large-scale data analysis"
"As previously mentioned, grid, peer-to-peer [18,20]_CITE and dataflow concepts provide mechanisms to handle similar challenges, and the Copernicus architecture has borrowed inspiration from all of them and integrated it tightly into two components aimed specifically at sampling problems: A peer-to-peer network and a workflow execution engine"
The network consists of three components that communicate securely using Transport Layer Security (TLS) [34]_CITE
The peer-to-peer network interfaces with the workflow execution engine [33]_CITE that creates jobs and passes them on to the network queue
"All communication in Copernicus is encrypted using TLS [34]_CITE which not only ensures encrypted network traffic, but it is also used to authenticate workers that want to connect to a server"
"For performance-heavy projects with large workflows that need very large numbers of workers, the source code can be compiled statically using Cython [35]_CITE"
Previous work further describes this using a concrete free energy calculation workflow [33]_CITE
Copernicus comes with pre-bundled analysis modules for these methods [33]_CITE
"It is also possible for the user to manually add provenance logs in a module, but to provide fully automated provenance support [36,37]_CITE the workflow engine has to be extended with these capabilities, and an interface needs to be provided so users can easily trace also manual changes or additions and at what time they where introduced"
"To illustrate two approaches Pegasus [27]_CITE supports provenance via its Mappers where it stores where data was used, produced and the software used and its input parameters [38]_CITE"
Fireworks [30]_CITE on the other hand provides provenance support since it stores each individual task in a database
"In the case of GROMACS [39]_CITE, it is for instance possible to detect a specific file that is generated only when a simulation has finished"
This benchmark structure is very similar to how other platforms such as Fireworks [30]_CITE and Swift [26]_CITE have executed theirs
"As a final test, the code was compiled using Cython [35]_CITE which further decreased the memory consumption and improved the maximum job processing speed to 17 jobs/s for 400 jobs and doubled the speed for tests with 1000 and 1500 jobs"
"Comparing the job processing throughput 14 to Fireworks [30]_CITE which is also built on Python, a similar workflow consisting of individual jobs that are followed by an analysis step (Reduce workflow in Fireworks terminology) has a performance of 7 jobs/s for 1000 jobs"
"General-purpose web servers such as LightHTTPd [41]_CITE and Nginx [42]_CITE can handle thousands of concurrent connections already today, so instead of optimizing the custom web server the application could be made WSGI [43]_CITE compatible to be used on one of these standard high-performance servers."
HTCondor (Condor) [18]_CITE and Dirac [21]_CITE are two resource management systems that can consolidate heterogeneous compute resources and expose them to users via a job queue
DAGMan [44]_CITE is an extension to Condor that provides an additional layer where a user can define a workflow that will be executed on a Condor infrastructure
Systems such as Pegasus [27]_CITE have further leveraged Condor and DAGMan to handle workflows at scale and enable portability
Gnutella [19]_CITE and Boinc [20]_CITE are both p2p systems that connect computers globally on a very large scale
Falkon [22]_CITE differs from the software mentioned above as it focuses on efficient task execution
Flumejava [24]_CITE is a system designed specifically to leverage MapReduce
Kepler [28]_CITE is a workflow tool where users can design their own workflows using a graphical user interface
WorkWays [45]_CITE leverages the Kepler platform and provides a gateway with a web based graphical user interface thus removing the complexity of installing the software
Triana [29]_CITE also offers a graphical user interface to create workflows
"A system that has taken a domain-specific approach is Taverna [46]_CITE, which is mainly designed to connect bioinformatics web-services to orchestrate a workflow"
Fireworks [30]_CITE is a system that supports dynamic workflows and allows users to build them by scripting tasks using Python or by defining a JSON document
"Fireworks [30]_CITE could also potentially be used for our purposes, but in its current form the architecture requires workers to have access to the database where the workflow is stored"
The need for steering computations and iterating computations in a workflow has attracted focus in recent work where models [47]_CITE have been developed to provide basic constructs in the workflow execution model to handle cases that require an undefined number of iterations
"Recent years have witnessed tremendous growth in video traffic on the Internet as a result of higher broadband data rates, proliferation in smart handheld devices [24,95]_CITE and affordable unlimited data plans offered by Internet Service Providers [51]_CITE"
An estimated one-third of all online activities on the Internet is spent watching video according to the recent report [100]_CITE
"Netflix alone is reportedly streaming over 1 billion h of video each month which is equivalent to almost 7,200,000 Terabytes of video traffic [37]_CITE, and this figure is rising constantly"
"Invented at the turn of the century [96]_CITE, CDNs now constitute the backbone for serving content [25,80]_CITE"
"Yet, as several recent studies suggest [60,109]_CITE, even CDNs are being stressed by the demands placed by video users during peak hours."
But this requires major investments both in infrastructure and administrative domain [67]_CITE
"However, from an economic perspective, traditional CDNs require significant investments for scaling up, as it requires deployment and management of geographically distributed data centres [54]_CITE."
"Interestingly, scaling up is precisely the strength of P2P content delivery: Early on, it was identified that P2P swarms possess the so-called self-scaling property [73,83]_CITE available capacity increases with the number of users in the swarm, as each user downloading content also adds new capacity by acting as a server for other users"
"However, obtaining content through self-organised P2P swarms has proved to be unreliable due to availability issues [52]_CITE, because in selfish swarming protocols such as BitTorrent, users leave the swarm after obtaining the item they need, making it difficult to put together complete copies of content"
"Although replacing selfish self-organising swarming with centrally managed P2P content exchange can improve completion rates considerably [81]_CITE, for CDN-grade reliability, peers would still need to stick around to allow other users in the swarm to complete, or to maintain a distributed copy of the entire content item across the set of active users in the swarm"
"Indeed, significant traffic savings (ie, from 50% to 88% of all consumer traffic) from peer-assistance have been recently reported in feasibility studies for a number of large VOD vendors, eg, BBC iPlayer [50]_CITE, Conviva [11]_CITE, and MSN Video [42]_CITE"
"Moreover, in the recent years PA-CDNs have been deployed by a number of leading commercial CDNs including Akamai [124]_CITE, ChinaCache [117]_CITE, and Xunlei [121]_CITE."
"This includes, among others, a need for economically sound mechanisms to incentivize user participation, which is reportedly low in some of the existing systems [124]_CITE and is recognized as a significant obstacle factor in the others [50]_CITE"
"Our work, with its focus on deployable peer-assisted content delivery, is complementary to several survey articles which have focused on traditional P2P-based content delivery [7]_CITE, or on specific P2P issues such as P2P overlay construction [68]_CITE, or chunk scheduling [62]_CITE"
"The closest work is that of Lu et al [66]_CITE, which surveys the design space of PA-CDN architectures, and highlights a fundamental choice between a tightly coupled or loosely coupled model of co-operation between the server-assisted and peer-assisted components of the PA-CDN"
The request-routing system in CDNs typically includes two basic modules for routing user requests to the most suitable edge server; i) request-routing algorithm and ii) request-routing mechanism [80]_CITE
"This entire process is designed to be transparent for the end-users and is most commonly implemented on the DNS level: A special purpose DNS server is programmed to redirect users requests to the IP address of an appropriate edge server by considering some important parameters such as load on edge server and its distance from the client, network proximity, and user perceived latency [19]_CITE"
"Content Delivery Network is a complex content distribution system and several issues and decisions are involved in managing and administrating the entire CDN infrastructure, including, where to place edge servers [18]_CITE, what content to replicate [32,48,97]_CITE, and on which cluster of servers to copy each piece of content [8]_CITE"
To provide a cheap pay-as-you-go service to a broad variety of customers some CDNs have adopted cloud technologies which became known in the literature as cloud CDNs [4]_CITE
"Last but not least, multiple telecom operators (AT&T, BT, Orange, Telefonica, KPN and Verizon among others) to gain a better control over the data services served to their users have deployed their private telco-CDNs [16,30]_CITE."
"Overall, Cisco has estimated that content delivery network traffic will carry nearly two-thirds of all Internet video traffic by 2020 [24]_CITE"
"Yet, several recent studies have reported that CDNs are being stressed by the demands placed during peak hours [60,109]_CITE"
"In a search for alternatives, the networking community have considered augmenting traditional CDN architecture with P2P networks [11,42,50,94]_CITE."
"However, this makes peer-to-peer systems prone to unpredictable changes in content availability - a phenomenon called peer churn - when peers frequently and suddenly leave or join the system due to network failures or their own intent [103]_CITE."
"With a fair participation among peers - ie, when users agree to share their resources in return of access to the system - the content swarms are said to be self-scalable [28]_CITE - as an increase in demand for a content item yields an equal increase in the number of the content suppliers [73,83]_CITE"
This structure is referred to as partially centralized P2P system [88]_CITE
"For instance, in the early versions of Skype - one of the first peer-to-peer Internet telephony networks - exploited well connected Supernodes to relay the traffic from the peers behind firewalls or Network Address Translators (NATs) [12,114]_CITE"
"Similarly, PPLive - the largest P2P live streaming service - rely on dedicated Tracker nodes to store the information about streaming channels, available video chunks and peers [40]_CITE"
Some versions of Bit-Torrent - a popular file sharing P2P system - also rely on Tracker nodes to distribute bulk software updates or multimedia files [88]_CITE.
"Similarly, the authors of [62]_CITE provided an overview of different approaches to address chunk scheduling techniques and peering mechanisms."
"Indeed, it has been reported in [31]_CITE that the presence of middle boxes is a challenging issue"
"A peer inside the private network can initiate a connection with Peers of public network, but a reverse connection is often complicated by administrative policies [29]_CITE."
"For example they may upload and share corrupted, malicious or illegal contents in the system or block nodes from using the service [89]_CITE"
"Indeed, pollution of the system with corrupted and unauthorized contents has been named as a serious problems in peer-to-peer networks [105]_CITE"
"The impact of user heterogeneity on the performance of traditional P2P systems has been analyzed in gory details in the previous literature [13,40,103,116,119]_CITE"
"Completion ratio: In [11]_CITE the authors have analyzed the user trace collected from the Conviva media platform and reported a very low completion ratio among users, when they abandon sessions after watching first few chunks"
"Similarly, a measurement study of PowerInfo [119]_CITE a video-on-demand system deployed by the world largest mobile phone operator (China Mobile) - has reported a 70% abandon rate among users as measured by the fraction of sessions which were abandoned after first 20 mins"
"The results suggested that mobile users abandon sessions with a higher rate, ie, only around 30% of mobile sessions last for longer than a half of a content duration in comparison to around 50% for the fixed-line sessions [51]_CITE"
The accesses of Spotify users [120]_CITE feature a vivid diurnal pattern: The lengths of user sessions are the longest during morning hours and are gradually decreasing by the end of the day
"The user sessions are also shorter during weekends than during working days, and on mobile devices than on desktop computers [120]_CITE."
"This phenomenon can be explained by the typical diurnal patterns in user accesses, when most of the users come online in the evening peak hours [11]_CITE, but also by the content availability policies specific for some video on-demand websites: for example, in catch-up TV systems, such as BBC iPlayer [51]_CITE, the content items are typically released for a limited amount of time, eg, 7 to 30 days, and feature a burst of accesses in the first few hours after the release [50]_CITE"
"The diurnal fluctuations in user arrivals are also vivid in Spotify where desktop accesses peak during evening hours, ie, 6 9pm, although the lengths of evening sessions are considerably shorter than the morning ones [120]_CITE."
"Indeed, in [50]_CITE, the authors reported that the Top-10% popular videos account for up to 80% of the total traffic in BBC iPlayer"
"Similarly, in [42]_CITE is reported that the Top-10 videos constituted a significant fraction of CDN traffic in MSN Video"
"The authors in [108]_CITE reported that, video popularity in online social networks (OSNs) follows the Zipf-like distribution"
"However, the content popularity would change quite dynamically, for example, due to daily releases of highly popular news and business-related shows [42]_CITE"
"It has been reported in [42]_CITE that, for small size MSN videos, users generally opt to view the entire or most of the video clip, and only 20% of users watch 60% of video content with the length greater than 30 min"
"Feasibility studies: Different feasibility studies [11,42,50]_CITE have been conducted to investigate the patterns of user accesses and their impact on the performance of PA-CDNs (see Table 2 for details)"
"Balachandran et al in [11]_CITE reported that, despite heterogeneity in the user access patterns and resources, peer-assistance has a potential to reduce the burden of CDN servers in Conviva media platform for up to 87% during peak hours"
"Similarly, in [50]_CITE the authors built on observation that the users of BBC iPlayer spend considerable amount of time online while watching long duration multimedia contents (eg, TV shows and feature movies) and suggested that up to 88% of BBC iPlayer traffic can be offloaded to peers"
"Simulation results from [11]_CITE have shown that up to 30% of traffic could be offloaded to P2P system by taking advantage of bootstrapping, ie, downloading initial chunks from multiple sources to decrease the startup delay"
"The authors of [42]_CITE reported that, by employing bandwidth saving mechanism, the server bandwidth requirements could be reduced from 2.20 Gbps to 79 Mbps (for details see-Limited upload bandwidth- in page 10 )."
"The asymmetry between upload and download bandwidths of end-mile Internet connections is yet another obstacle for video streaming in many peer-to-peer applications such as Bit-torrent, PPlive, and Maze networks: A downstream rate of ADSL2+, for example, can be as much as 17 times higher than the upstream rate, suggesting a potential bottleneck in uploading bandwidth when streaming a high resolution content item from peers [10]_CITE."
"Peers churn: There are a number of other factors apart from user interests - discussed in the previous section - which impact the dynamics of peers availability, or peers churn, in peer-to-peer systems: A user session might be interrupted due to a network failure, overloaded CPU or a software crash [55]_CITE"
"To tackle the negative impact of peers churn on the performance of peer-assisted content delivery systems, the authors in [20]_CITE proposed a crowdsourcing-based content distribution system called Thunder Crystal"
"Similarly, Youku, one of the largest VOD service in China, has deployed millions of dedicated intelligent peer routers with 8GB storage capacity at consumers homes and offices to assist content distribution [69]_CITE"
"Based on a trace driven evaluation of the YouTube traffic, the authors in [78]_CITE proposed a P2PTube approach which relies on exploiting set-top-boxes to assist content distribution"
"As the results from the [78]_CITE suggest, as much as 46% of videos can be served from peers in the proposed system - an advance of 10% with respect to the previous result reported in [125]_CITE"
"The authors in [38]_CITE devised a mathematical model to evaluate the impact of peer-churn on a PA-CDN, when the users of set-top-boxes are not willing to share their resources"
"Similarly, to deal with peer churn the authors in [72]_CITE proposed Home Box-assisted approach which relies on exploiting set-top-boxes as proxies between users and CDNs."
Limited upload bandwidth: The impact of the limited upload bandwidth on peer-assisted content distribution has been evaluated in [42]_CITE
"To improve the quality of service without putting too much of a burden on the peers, the authors of [42]_CITE also suggest two different peer selection policies: Water Levelling (WL) and Greedy Policy (GP)"
"A biased selection of peers without considering underlying physical topology might lead to severe performance degradation in terms of access delays and bandwidth wastage if, for instance, peers located within the same building use two different ISPs and so, although physically placed close to each other, are very distant in network terms [5]_CITE"
"The authors of [111]_CITE proposed to limit the P2P traffic within sub-networks, or behind common gateways"
"Similar idea of using Kademlia algorithm has also been suggested in [9]_CITE, whereas the authors of [27]_CITE have proposed a locality aware mechanism based on the website content."
"To achieve a lower startup delay, the authors in [112]_CITE proposed a three phase streaming hybrid CDN-P2P architecture that allows peers to download initial chunks of a content item from the geographically closed CDN nodes and remaining chunks from a P2P swarm"
"Particularly, Ha et al in [39]_CITE suggested that, for minimizing startup latency the buffer part at the start of the playback must be filled in with a high priority"
"Similarly, Lu et al in [65]_CITE suggested organizing the playback buffer into three different regions, where a startup region and a common region are equivalent to the ones proposed in [39]_CITE"
The authors of [41]_CITE suggested that a lower startup delay and continuous transmission could be achieved by utilizing P2P resources more efficiently
"Thus, the authors of [53]_CITE proposed a decentralized PA-CDN architecture - named the Group Based CDN-P2P (G-CP2P) - which estimates the latency between two peers using a set of landmarks"
An SP exploits a distributed hash tables algorithm (DHT) called a content addressable network (CAN) [84]_CITE
The algorithm is based on the binning technique proposed in [85]_CITE and operates as follows
Thanks to this locality awareness mechanism the proposed solution has showed an average decrease of 500 ms in the playback delay with respect to the previous location oblivious result in [112]_CITE.
"In summary, our analysis in this section suggests that, the most promising compromise in mixing advantages of peer-assisted and traditional CDNs to improve QoS has been so far found in bootstrapping video streaming with initial chunks downloaded from CDN nodes and delegating the remaining work to peers [39,65]_CITE"
"Similarly, the peer-assisted content delivery system may benefit from redirecting streaming requests to CDNs in emergency cases when no sufficient upload bandwidth is available among the peers to meet playback deadlines [112]_CITE"
"The peers inaccessibility problem; when a peer inside a private network can initiate a connection with the peers of public networks, but a reverse connection is often complicated by administrative policies [29]_CITE, has been discussed in some of the earliest partially centralized PA-CDN articles [101,102]_CITE"
"The simulation results in [102]_CITE suggest that, the users which are connected outside a firewall have slower downloading rates since they are unable to establish connections with the nodes in private networks, whereas peers behind firewalls exchange more, therefore, leading to an increase in downloading speed."
"Many other solutions have been proposed to deal with inaccessibility issues in various perspectives and situations including STUN (Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol through Network Address Translators) [91]_CITE, TURN (Traversal Using Relay NAT) [70]_CITE, RSIP (Realm Specific IP) [17]_CITE, MIDCOM (Middle box Communication) [99]_CITE, UPnP (Universal Plug and Play), ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) [90]_CITE, etc"
"It is worth noting, that all currently deployed NAT traversal solutions have their limitations (for instance - STUN does not support any feedback mechanism) and their further development remains an interesting research direction [21]_CITE."
"To address this concern the authors of [115]_CITE proposed a peers authorization mechanism and a network coding scheme in which each packet is encoded and decoded at the node level using efficient linear codes, thus, allowing for copyrights protection"
The authors of [49]_CITE proposed a control schema over copyrights at a Tracker server in which only legally authorized content items are distributed to the peers.
"Indeed, it has been shown in [124]_CITE that only around 30% of all peers opt-in to contribute their resources in Akamai NetSession, whereas in [50]_CITE the authors named peers participation as the main obstacle factor which affects the amount of bandwidth savings achievable with peer-assistance"
"The influence of the peer co-operation on the scaling properties of peer-assisted CDNs has been analytically studied in [38,47]_CITE and [46]_CITE"
"While the results from [38,47]_CITE have indicated non-cooperative peers as a major problem for scaling peer-assisted CDNs, the findings from the latter work emphasize on the opposite - PA-CDNs with co-operative peers are extremely scalable"
"A limited contribution policy presented in [112]_CITE obliges every user to contribute some fraction of its upload bandwidth resources to a limited number of sessions, for a limited period of time or both"
In [34]_CITE the authors present an economic model for PA-CDNs in which user participation in peer-assistance is incentivized via free high quality video offers
"The authors in [101,102]_CITE proposed a policy akin to Bit-Torrent system to incentivize peers based on their stability and resources contributed to the system"
The authors in [65]_CITE proposed an incentive policy that selects peers directly via edge nodes based on the bandwidth they contribute to the system
"Similarly, authors in [26]_CITE introduced a superiority index for peers that are more stable and share higher bandwidth."
The authors of [76]_CITE have proposed a peer-assisted model with economic incentives for all participating parties including both peers and ISPs
Cho and Yi [23]_CITE presented a cooperative game theory approach to validate a profit sharing mechanism with multiple content providers and peers
The Qtrade system described in [110]_CITE provides a QoE-aware incentive policy which considers the visual quality of videos uploaded by the peers as a criterion for calculating their contributions
The proposed system employs the video quality metric (VQM) [82]_CITE for measuring the loss in users perceived QoE and distributes the surplus bandwidth to the top-scoring peers.
Historically peer-to-peer systems have been ISP-oblivious and could generate significant amounts of the cross-ISP traffic - a fact which reportedly polarized ISPs attitude towards peer-to-peer systems [88]_CITE
A centralized architecture to minimize the inter-ISP traffic has been proposed in [67]_CITE
"In contrast, the authors of [78]_CITE proposed to employ the existing ISP-aware P2P protocols for PA-CDNs as a solution to handle the tussle between the ISPs and P2P networks"
A similar solution for live streaming has been presented in [9]_CITE
"Similarly, in [78]_CITE the authors rely on the Kademlia and ALTO protocols for peer tracking and matching."
"Wang et al [106]_CITE proposed an ISP-friendly rate allocation algorithm for peer-assisted VOD systems, in which the Tracker server selects the neighbours based on two key criteria: i) the peers belonging to the same autonomous system (AS) ; and ii) the peers arrived in the system at the same time"
A theoretical approach to understanding the relationship between CDN bandwidth and traffic localization at different levels inside the ISPs has been proposed in [123]_CITE
Xunlei is the 10th largest Internet company in China and Kankan is its peer-assisted on-demand streaming service with 31.4 million unique daily users as of the end of 2012 [122]_CITE
As reported in [122]_CITE - 30M Kankan users have installed Xunlei accelerator to assist content distribution.
"In 2007 ChinaCache deployed about 500 cache servers in 8 districts of China, out of which 50 are the core service nodes responsible for live streaming and over 400 edge caches deployed in a close proximity to users [117]_CITE."
"NetSession [124]_CITE is a global peer-assisted content distribution network, originally developed by Red Swoosh, a P2P content delivery company founded by Travis Kalanick and Michael Todd in 2001 and acquired by Akamai Technology in 2007 [86]_CITE"
"Spotify is a popular on-demand music streaming service which, according to [35]_CITE exploits peer-assistance to serve its 10 million-large user base around the world"
"Interestingly, the average content length on Tudou is longer than that of Youtube and - although Tudou has a lower number of daily views - it surpasses Youtube in monthly traffic, ie, 15 billion min of videos are served by Tudou per month versus 3 billion served by Youtube [64]_CITE."
"NetSession and LiveSky [61,63]_CITE use standard DNS request routing techniques and redirect users based on their location and the current load on the edge servers: if the nearest edge server is overloaded, the request is redirected to the next nearest and less loaded one"
"A measurement study in [122]_CITE suggests that 45% and 20% of users requests in Kankan are forwarded to the first nearest and the second nearest edge servers, respectively, when a flash crowd hits the system, whereas the rest of the requests are distributed equally among other nearby and less burden edge servers"
"In addition Kankan follows the three phase streaming mechanism proposed in [112]_CITE, ie, pure CDN streaming, hybrid CDN-P2P streaming and pure P2P streaming phase"
"Zhang et al in [122]_CITE reported that, peer-assistance enables significant benefits for Kankan in distributing popular videos, ie, up to 98.0% of the video content in Kankan are distributed in a peer-to-peer fashion, whereas edge nodes are responsible for handling a long-tail of unpopular videos"
"The authors in [61,63,117]_CITE built on observation that despite the fact that the vast majority of users (90%) access the service from behind the firewalls 30% of traffic can still be distributed via peer-assistance"
Authors in [124]_CITE reported that - although only 31% of users in Akamai NetSession opt for sharing their upload bandwidth resources - 70%-80% of traffic can be offloaded to peers without any negative impact on the performance
"The measurement results from [35,56,120]_CITE have reported that, only 8.8% of Spotify music traffic is delivered from Spotify servers, whereas the remaining 91.2% are delivered from either peer-assistance (35.8%) or from local caches (55.4%)"
"Similarly, the authors in [64]_CITE have analyzed the user trace date collected from the Tudou platform and reported a traffic saving from 36% to 96% for popular video content."
"It is estimated that, 90% of users in China are located behind the firewalls [45,61]_CITE"
"Among those, as the user trace collected [61]_CITE from LiveSky is revealed, 37% are not available for peer-to-peer distribution and nearly 30% can provide uploading capacity sufficient to serve only one user at a time"
"To tackle the problem of peers inaccessibility behind the middle boxes, LiveSky and NetSession have exploited the modified version of STUN [92]_CITE and UDP protocols"
Users can also manually configure the size of the cache up to 1GB [56]_CITE
"Yet, it is reported in [124]_CITE that only around 30% of NetSession users agree to participate in peer-assistance"
"This includes, among others a need for economically sound mechanisms to incentivize user participation, which is reportedly low in some of the existing systems [124]_CITE and is recognized as a significant obstacle factor in the others [38,50]_CITE"
"It has been shown, in various recent papers, that by employing efficient topology-aware and ISP-friendly peer selection policies [67,123]_CITE the deleterious influences of inter-ISP traffic can be minimized"
"Indeed, a study on the two leading CDN operators, ie Limelight and Akamai, demonstrated that, significant traffic savings (ie, up to 66.53% for Akamai and 65.55% for Limlight) can be achieved, even if peer-to-peer traffic is localized within the ISP domains [44]_CITE"
"However, [59]_CITE has raised an important concern with respect to ISP-friendly peer-assisted design, suggesting that localizing ISP traffic may negatively impact the quality of service"
"The first field trial of eMTC took place in early 2016 to validate its potential for addressing medium data rate IoT connectivity use cases [87]_CITE, and standardization of a further lower-complexity device category (NB-IoT) that supports data rates of 200 kbps completed in June 16"
"On the other hand, optimisation of uplink M2M networks has been studied recently, and energy-efficient machine-to-data aggregator communication has been investigated via PHY-layer optimization [71]_CITE"
The combination of video coding and fountain coding for live video streaming over wireless networks has been proposed for IoT applications recently [104]_CITE
"Finally, MAC-layer, network (NET)-layer, and application (APP) aware PHY-layer protocols suitable for M2M communications have been considered recently [3,6,87,95]_CITE."
"This has led to the sustained growth of Wikipedia [24]_CITE, but also to possible future scalability problems"
"Due to Wikipedia openness and lack of centralized supervision, authors have to overcome problems unknown in the editing of traditional encyclopedias [25]_CITE."
"The global impact of this kind of damage, while rather low, is rising [22]_CITE"
Vi gas et al [29]_CITE noted that not only controversial articles are threatened by edit wars.
The Wikipedia knowledge community is one of the best examples of how collective intelligence can be achieved on the Web [16]_CITE
Wikipedia can also be seen as a model of collaborative work for future economies [31]_CITE
"Diverse approaches have been used in order to capture various social phenomena, such as editor collaboration [17]_CITE, conflict [7]_CITE, mutual trust or respect, and more"
"The proposed synthesis uses a Multidimensional (Multilayered) Behavioral Social Network (MBSN) [11]_CITE; specifically, we use an MBSN model of the Wikipedia knowledge community (in Section 3) consisting of four dimensions (Discussions, Co-edits, Reverts , and Topics)"
"One of the early papers on Wikipedia collaboration [12]_CITE comprehensively studies the effect of conflict on collaboration on three levels: global, article and user"
"In [13]_CITE, the authors examined the correlation of coordination and conflict in wiki production groups"
"Recent research also recognizes the role of social norms and context in online social networks, similarly to Wikipedia [4]_CITE."
"In [8]_CITE, the authors present an examination of Wikipedia articles with varying needs for coordination"
"Paper [21]_CITE contains an analysis of 58 talk pages in the following categories: articles with most editors, most views, and controversial articles"
"Behavioral social networks are the subject of numerous research efforts in other domains, for example in the study of Peer-to-Peer networks [15]_CITE, grids [23]_CITE, in the study of reputation systems for e-commerce [10,18,19]_CITE and recommender systems [2]_CITE"
"The MBSN is a set of graphs consisting of nodes [11]_CITE, each representing one Wikipedia contributor (some graphs may also contain other nodes, such as Wikipedia categories) and edges, each representing one kind of relationship between them"
"For this reason, we hypothesized that the Co-edits network could be interpreted as the social relationship of trust [32]_CITE."
Revert operations have frequently been used in the literature to model conflict and to identify edit wars [14]_CITE
We hypothesized that the Reverts network could be interpreted as the social relationship of distrust or criticism [30]_CITE.
"For example, in [20]_CITE we described how the four dimensions of this network were linked to the votes cast in the RfA (Request for administrators) procedures"
"In [20]_CITE, we showed that the strength of edges in the Reverts dimension was higher for votes against than for votes in favor of a candidate in the RfA procedure"
"While conscious of the strengths and weaknesses of the presented measures, we consider both of them good indices of the social relationship of acquaintance in terms of face validity [1]_CITE; in our opinion they adequately depict the meaning of the concept"
"We decided to rely on subjects available through informal relationships and the Polish Wikipedia discussion group, and then to snowball (by asking respondents to invite others) [1]_CITE."
"This can be achieved using so-called ROC curves [6]_CITE, which visualize the tradeoff between false positives and negatives in a single chart"
"Because the regression and Support Vector Machines classifiers cannot use records with missing values, we used the standard imputation methods tree surrogate (a decision tree is built for each attribute and used to fill in missing values) and median (missing values are filled in with the median) [5]_CITE"
"For the machine learning process, the dataset was balanced by undersampling observations with a target value of 0 [3]_CITE"
"Single Sign-On (SSO) technologies such as Security Assertion Markup Language ( SAML,_OASIS,_2005_CITE) and OpenID Connect ( Sakimura_et al.,_2014_CITE) have made general service providers free from authentication itself and only consume the assertion generated by the Verifier, which is called Identity Provider (IdP) in SAML and OpenID Provider (OP) in OpenID"
"It is true that a private key stored in a tamper-resistant IC card can be distinguished with the Qualified Certificate specified in RFC 3739 ( Santesson_et al.,_2004_CITE) with the Qualified Certificate statement 5.2.4 in ETSI TS 101 862 ( ETSI,_2004_CITE) which is for secure signature-creation devices with the conditions in Annex III of Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community framework for electronic signatures ( European_Union,_2000_CITE)"
"It assigns requirements on tokens, token and credential management, authentication process, and assertions to each Level of Assurance (LoA) from Level 1 to Level 4 each of which was introduced in OMB M-04-04 ( Office_of_Management_and_Budget,_2003_CITE)"
"The issues are listed in the threat analysis done in a paper ( Ratha_et al.,_1999_CITE) and they are categorized into three categories"
"A paper ( Hachez_et al.,_2000_CITE) has given a solution to the issues as general as possible for the case where smart cards are used"
"Another paper ( Bechelli_et al.,_2002_CITE) has also given a solution for a specific type of smart card for biometric authentication, called Match on Card in the paper but currently called on-card biometric comparison in general, with the assumption that the smart card is ISO/IEC 7816 conformant"
"These assumptions are appropriate since tamper-resistant PKI cards conformant to ISO/IEC 7816-4 ( ISO/IEC_7816-4,_2013_CITE) and 8 ( ISO/IEC_7816-8,_2004_CITE) satisfy (A) to (E)"
"The third is that it is generated by biometric data captured at a biometric sensor device ( Takahashi_et al.,_2015_CITE)"
"For generation of cAC product report, a type SignedData, specified in RFC 3852 ( Housley,_2004_CITE)/RFC 5911 ( Hoffman_and_Schaad,_2010_CITE) Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), is applied"
"The second field levelCMVP is to show the level of Cryptographic Module Validation Program specified in FIPS 140-2 ( National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology,_2001_CITE) and ISO/IEC 19790 ( ISO/IEC_19790,_2012_CITE) if the cryptographic module in the cAC product is certified"
"But the whole security issues that ( Ratha_et al.,_1999_CITE) pointed out, already referenced in Section 3, apply"
"BiometricType and BiometricSubtype are types for modalities defined in ISO/IEC 19785-3 ( ISO/IEC_19785-3,_2007_CITE)"
"In signature scheme with a fuzzy private key ( Takahashi_et al.,_2015_CITE), a private key, also the corresponding public key, is generated from the processed biometric sample"
"Certification bodies in Common Criteria (CC) ( Common_Criteria_Recognition_Arrangement,_2012_CITE) scheme are also candidates where CC is a scheme for security evaluation and certification of IT products"
"CC is also internationally standardized as ISO/IEC 15408 ( ISO/IEC_15408-1,_2012_CITE)."
"Among the various solutions proposed to that end, the adoption of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) Schmidt_(2006)_CITE has fared rather well by measure of interest and success"
"eg, ( Bordin_and_Vardanega,_2007;_Panunzio_and_Vardanega,_2007;_Bordin_et_al.,_2008_CITE)) shows that the higher level of abstraction in the design process facilitated by MDE allows addressing non-functional concerns earlier in the development, thereby enabling proactive analysis, maturation and consolidation of the software design"
"ISO/IEC/(IEEE)_(2007)_CITE defines an architecture as composed of: (a) the fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components; (b) their relationships to each other, and to the environment; and (c) the principles guiding its design and evolution"
"On that basis, Panunzio_and_Vardanega_(2013)_CITE regards the concept of software reference architecture as proceeding from: (i) a component model, to design the software as a composition of individually verifiable and reusable software units; (ii) a computational model, to relate the design entities of the component model, their non-functional needs for concurrency, time and space, to a framework of analysis techniques which assures that the architectural description is statically analysable in the dimensions of interest by construction; (iii) a programming model, to ensure that the implementation of the design entities obeys the semantics, the assumptions and the constraints of the computational model; (iv) a conforming execution platform, which actively preserves at run time the system and software properties asserted by static analysis and it is able to notify and react to possible violations of them."
That joint initiative proved the component model (initially captured in Panunzio_and_Vardanega_(2010)_CITE) to be an essential facilitator to the industrial adoption of the proposed approach
"It also showed the need for the component model definition and implementation to be enriched with support for: (1) specification and model-based analysis of non-functional requirements; (2) separation between functional and non-functional concerns, achieved by the enactment of design views (specializing the definitions of ISO 42010 ( ISO/IEC/(IEEE),_2007_CITE)) and careful allocation of concerns to software entities; (3) selective inclusion of domain-specific concerns, whether functional or non-functional, to address special industrial needs."
"Two decades later the Correctness by Construction (C-by-C) manifesto ( Chapman,_2006_CITE) promoted a software production method fostering the early detection and removal of development errors for safer, cheaper and more reliable software"
"When composability and compositionality can be assured by static analysis, guaranteed throughout implementation, and actively preserved at run time, we may speak of composition with guarantees ( Vardanega,_2009_CITE), which is our grander goal here."
"In accord with Sifakis_(2005)_CITE, we maintain that composability is achieved when the designated properties of individual components, captured in terms of needs and obligations, are preserved on component composition, deployment on target and execution"
"The WCET is a local property of the program (that is, the service attached to the interface in question): composability in the time dimension ( Puschner_et_al.,_2009_CITE) is achieved if the interfering effect caused by the presence of other components in the system does not prevent a safe and tight WCET bound to be determined for every single interface service"
"Components and connectors are present in most component-oriented approaches: a wealth of literature discusses their various possible flavours (see for example ( Szyperski,_2002;_Lau_and_Wang,_2007;_Mehta_et_al.,_2000_CITE))"
"They are used in approaches (like the one presented herein) which present an endogenous treatment of non-functional properties (ie, outside of the component) ( Crnkovic_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
Chaudron_and_Crnkovic_(2008)_CITE defines a software component as a software building block that conforms to a component model
"The semantics of that declarative language emanates from the chosen computational model: the Ravenscar Computational Model (RCM) ( Burns_et_al.,_2014_CITE) in our case"
"The connector ( Mehta_et_al.,_2000_CITE) is the software entity responsible for the interaction between components, which actually is a mediated communication between containers"
"This also means that we do not require an approach for the creation or composition of complex connectors ( Spitznagel_and_Garlan,_2001_CITE)"
"In terms of the rich classification proposed in Crnkovic_et_al._(2011)_CITE, our component model (i) addresses the modeling and implementation phases of the development life cycle, (ii) is independent from the programming language, (iii) provides constructs for interface specification, (iv) allows expressing a limited set of interaction patterns, (v) supports specification, composition and analysis of non-functional properties, and (vi) is special-purpose as intended to high-integrity embedded real-time systems."
G ler_and_Sifakis_(2002)_CITE focuses on integration of components with heterogeneous interactions and execution paradigms
"SaveCCM ( Hansson_et_al.,_2004_CITE) targets heavy vehicular systems"
"The PROGRESS component model (ProCom) ( Carlson_et_al.,_2010_CITE) extends SaveCCM to address high-level concerns typical of early design stages of a large-scale distributed embedded system: high-level early analysis and deployment to processing units"
"The ROBOCOP component model ( Muskens_et_al.,_2005_CITE), targets the consumer electronic domain"
"Giotto ( Henzinger_et_al.,_2001_CITE) is a progenitor in a family of time-triggered languages and tools, which specialize for control processing where deterministic time of execution is inbred to the domain culture ( Henzinger_et_al.,_2003_CITE)"
"The Ptolemy project ( Lee,_2001_CITE) studies modeling, simulation, and design of concurrent, real-time, embedded systems realized as an assembly of concurrent components"
"The ISO standard 42010 ( ISO/IEC/(IEEE),_2007_CITE) stipulates that architectural description of the system is organized into one or more constituents called views , and a view is a partial representation of a system from a particular viewpoint, which is the expression of some stakeholders concerns"
"eg, ( Bordin_and_Vardanega,_2007_CITE), for our reference choices on this topic)."
"The value for the WCET can later be refined with bounds for a given target platform obtained by timing analysis ( Wilhelm_et_al.,_2008_CITE)."
Schedulability analysis (in the simplest forms of response-time analysis equations derived from Joseph_and_Pandya_(1986)_CITE) can in fact provide response times only for individual tasks
"The specification of end-to-end requirements can instead be used by a more expressive analysis framework (such as ( Palencia_and_Gonz lez_Harbour,_1998_CITE)) to compute the completion time of end-to-end chains of operations as well as on single intermediate operations in the chain."
"For example, schedulability analysis verifies whether the timing requirements set on interfaces can be met ( Bordin_et_al.,_2008_CITE)."
"For our choice of computational model (ie, RCM), we defined the whole set of allowable containers and connectors in a library of code archetypes ( Panunzio_and_Vardanega,_2012_CITE), which vastly simplifies automatic code generation."
"Space-specific view, where the designer can specify the use of services related to commandability and observability of the spacecraft (ie, the PUS services ( European_Cooperation_for_Space_Standardization,_2003_CITE));"
"In the former, the designer can specify in the model the functional code of a component implementation using UML state machines and generate C++ code for it ( Ciccozzi_et_al.,_2011_CITE); otherwise, the designer can always associate Ada or C/C++ source code written manually to a component implementation"
"Additionally, in CHESS, study partners focused on the development of various forms of model-based dependability analysis (ie, error modeling, state-based analysis, FMEA, FMECA) ( Montecchi_et_al.,_2011_CITE)."
"The reason is twofold and in line with our previous work ( Bordin_et_al.,_2008_CITE)"
"In CHESS, the specification language for components in the PIM user model comprises UML entities, some high-level MARTE stereotypes ( Object_Management_Group,_2009_CITE), and a few CHESS-specific stereotypes"
"Model-based schedulability analysis is provided via integration with a plug-in by the University of Cantabria, which extracts the analysis information from our PSM to feed the MAST analysis tool ( Gonz lez_Harbour_et_al.,_2001_CITE)"
"After non-functional attributes have been set, a call chain may span across components but it is guaranteed to be finite (it is represented as a tree with a leaf at every first occurrence of a deferred operation, ie, with sporadic or bursty activation pattern, which is executed by its own thread of execution) and acyclic ( Cancila_et_al.,_2010_CITE)."
"The most fundamental model that is used to analyze sequential algorithms is the Random Access Machine (RAM) model [21]_CITE, which we teach undergraduates in their first algorithms class"
There are also a number of other models that consider the memory access costs of sequential algorithms in different ways [23 29]_CITE.
"For parallel computing, the analogue for the RAM model is the Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM) model [30]_CITE, and there is a large body of work describing and analyzing algorithms in the PRAM model [31,32]_CITE"
"Therefore, researchers have designed various models that capture memory hierarchies for various types of machines such as distributed memory machines [33 35]_CITE, shared memory machines and multi-cores [36 40]_CITE, or the combination of the two [41,42]_CITE."
"To motivate this enterprise and to understand the importance of high thread counts on highly-threaded, many-core machines, let us consider a simple application that performs Bloom filter set membership tests on an input stream of biosequence data on GPUs [3]_CITE"
We analyze 4 classic algorithms for the problem of computing All Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) on a weighted graph in the TMM model [43]_CITE
"Using a different approach, Hong et al [17]_CITE propose another analytical model to capture the cost of memory operations by counting the number of parallel memory requests in terms of memory-warp parallelism (MWP) and computation-warp parallelism (CWP)"
"More recently, Sim et al [48]_CITE develop a performance analysis framework that consists of an analytical model and profiling tools"
Our first algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm [53]_CITE that uses repeated matrix multiplication to calculate all pairs shortest paths
The pseudo-code for Dijkstra algorithm is given in Algorithm 1 [55]_CITE
"It is informed by our experience in the development and sustained operation of the CBRAIN [1]_CITE, NSG [2,3]_CITE and VIP [4]_CITE science gateways during the past 7 years, as well as by lessons learned from several science gateway and workflow projects such as SHIWA 1 1HYPERLINK"
"These efforts resulted in tools among which Askalon [5]_CITE, Hyperflow [6]_CITE, MOTEUR [7]_CITE, Pegasus [8,9]_CITE, Swift [10]_CITE, Taverna [11]_CITE, Triana [12]_CITE, VisTrails [13]_CITE, WS-PGRADE [14]_CITE and WS-VLAM [15]_CITE"
An overview of workflow system capabilities is available in [16]_CITE.
"In neuroimaging, our primary domain of interest, tools such as Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python, Pipelines and Interfaces [17]_CITE), PSOM (Pipeline System for Octave and Matlab [18]_CITE), PMP (Poor Man Pipeline [19]_CITE), RPPL [20]_CITE, SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping [21]_CITE) and FSL (FMRIB Software Library [22]_CITE) provide abstractions and functions to handle the data and computing flow between processes implemented in a variety of programming languages"
"Various science gateways have been developed, including frameworks such as Apache Airavata [23]_CITE, the Catania Science Gateway Framework [24]_CITE and WS-PGRADE/gUSE [14]_CITE"
"Numerous science gateways were built using such frameworks [25,24]_CITE or as standalone systems [1,4]_CITE"
"For this purpose, science gateways may balance the load among different instances of the same engine, start new engines elastically using auto-scaling techniques such as the ones reviewed in [26]_CITE, and use advanced task scheduling policies on the infrastructure to improve performance, fault-tolerance and fairness among users."
"When the infrastructure is a grid or a cloud, control may be achieved for instance using libraries that implement standards such as SAGA (Simple API for Grid Applications [39]_CITE), DRMAA (Distributed Resource Management Application API [40]_CITE), or OCCI (Open Cloud Computing Interface [41]_CITE)."
Tools and services such as JSAGA [42]_CITE or Data Avenue [43]_CITE can be used to homogenize these interfaces.
A similar type of interaction is used in pilot-job systems [44]_CITE and other agent-based computing models.
"It has been developed mostly for translation between well-structured and relatively simple workflow languages such as GWorkflowDL and Scufl [45]_CITE, and for translation among the 5 workflow systems in the SHIWA project: Askalon, MOTEUR, Taverna, Triana and WS-PGRADE."
"Tight integration is the model adopted in the Catania Science Gateway Framework [24]_CITE (see specific documentation on workflows 4 4HYPERLINK, in the Distributed application runtime environment (DARE) [27]_CITE, in Galaxy [46]_CITE, and in the LONI Pipeline Environment [28]_CITE"
"This architecture is largely adopted in systems such as the Apache Airvata framework [23]_CITE, GridSFEA [32]_CITE, Vine Toolkit [31]_CITE, Virtual Imaging Platform [4]_CITE, the systems in [30,3]_CITE and the WS-PGRADE/gUSE framework [14]_CITE"
"The integration between the HubZero science gateway and the Pegasus workflow engine performed in [29]_CITE also uses a service architecture, where the d interaction is implemented as a set of calls to Pegasus command-line tools (eg, pegasus-status, pegasus-plan, etc.)."
An example of such interaction is the use of hierarchical workflows in Pegasus [9]_CITE
"Nested workflows have long been available in workflow engines, for instance in the Taverna workbench [11]_CITE"
"Nested workflows were notably used by the SHIWA Science Gateway to implement so-called Coarse-Grained workflow interoperability [35]_CITE, ie, to integrate various workflow engines in a consistent platform."
"In the SHIWA Simulation Platform, it is implemented through the IWIR language, which provides a common language for portability across grid workflow systems [37]_CITE and allows conversion among n workflow languages using 2n interactions instead of n2"
"Tavaxy [36]_CITE enables the import, merging and execution of Taverna [11]_CITE and Galaxy [46]_CITE workflows; when some workflow parts cannot be imported, workflows are run by Tavaxy as nested workflows using their native engine"
The work in [38]_CITE describes workflow conversion from KNIME [47]_CITE to WS-PGRADE/gUSE and from Galaxy [46]_CITE to WS-PGRADE/gUSE.
"4 shows the architecture of the Virtual Imaging Platform (VIP), where the MOTEUR workflow engine [7]_CITE is invoked through a service"
Task encapsulation is used in the CBRAIN gateway [1]_CITE to integrate the FSL toolkit [22]_CITE and the PSOM workflow engine [18]_CITE
The CBRAIN-PSOM integration [33]_CITE is shown in Fig_5(II)
The PSOM workflow engine adopts a pilot-job architecture [44]_CITE where a master coordinates workflow execution by submitting workers and establishing direct communication channels with them
"The pool model was implemented in the SHIWA pool [34]_CITE diagrammed in Fig_6 , where agents can wrap different types of workflow engines to execute workflows expressed with different languages"
"As detailed in [36]_CITE, workflow conversion (interaction g) is implemented through an interactive authoring module where users can check and edit workflow imports, and a mapper module that performs some language substitutions"
The availability and accuracy of fine-grained debugging information usually depends on the number of software layers between the science gateway and the workflow engine [48]_CITE
Deelman et al [16]_CITE have further characterized the features of workflow systems
"Shahand et al [50]_CITE presents the Science Gateway Canvas, which is a business reference model where the most relevant functional components are organized into functional groups"
Olabarriaga et al [48]_CITE presents a user-centered view of the ecosystem of science gateways with focus on workflow management
"Such over-approximations have been used, among other things, in the analysis of cryptographic protocols [8]_CITE, for termination analysis [9,13]_CITE and for establishing non-confluence of term rewrite systems [19]_CITE"
"This research was born of involvement in the development of three tools for term rewriting, CeTA [18]_CITE, a certifier for termination and confluence proofs generated by provers, CSI [19]_CITE, an automated confluence prover, and Image 1 [11]_CITE, an automated termination prover"
"The distinguishing feature of a certifier is that it is highly trustworthy; in the case of CeTA, this is achieved by proving its code correct in the proof assistant Isabelle [17]_CITE"
"Both CSI and Image 1 use quasi-deterministic automata [13]_CITE to produce overapproximations of reachable terms, and CeTA could not certify the resulting proofs"
"Comparison to quasi-deterministic automata We carefully analyze how state-compatible automata relate to quasi-deterministic automata, which were introduced by Korp and Middeldorp [13]_CITE to overcome problems with tree automata completion for non-left-linear term rewrite systems"
"The relation to quasi-deterministic automata can be found in Section 4.1, and we relate state-compatible automata to quasi-models by Endrullis et al [4]_CITE in Section 4.2."
Adaptation to match-bounds The match-bounds technique by Geser et al [9]_CITE is a technique for proving termination of term rewrite systems
"Korp and Middeldorp [13]_CITE extended match-bounds to non-left-linear systems, using so-called raise-consistent, quasi-deterministic automata"
Remark A preliminary version of this paper was already published in [5]_CITE
"Even more importantly, we now present all details on how to adapt state-compatible automata for match-bounds to non-left-linear term rewrite systems, a task which was only mentioned as future work in [5]_CITE"
For introductions to these topics see [1]_CITE and [3]_CITE.
"In this section we relate deterministic state-coherent, state-compatible automata to quasi-deterministic automata by Korp and Middeldorp [13]_CITE"
"In his thesis [12]_CITE, Korp generalizes Definition 17 (cf"
"[12,_Definition_3.10]_CITE) by incorporating an auxiliary relation A that may be viewed as a precursor to our relation"
"Indeed if A=(F,Q,Qf, ) satisfies [12,_Definition_3.10]_CITE using A, then taking ={l q|l lhs( ), A(l) q}, the automaton A =(F,Q,Qf, ) satisfies Definition 17, noting that A(l) is just another notation for the designated state pl of l"
"Furthermore, Lemmas 20 and 21 and Theorem 24 of [13]_CITE remain true for extended quasi-compatible automata, and therefore L(A ) is closed under rewriting by R if A is extended quasi-deterministic and compatible with R"
"In [4]_CITE, Endrullis et al introduce partial quasi-models for establishing local termination, ie, termination on a restricted set of terms"
"(This is not a problem in [4]_CITE, where the languages of interest are terminating terms"
"Tree automata have an obvious application for disproving (local) confluence, as pointed out in [19]_CITE"
In this section we show how tree automata can be used to prove termination via match-bounds [9]_CITE
"In [13]_CITE, raise-consistent automata are used to ensure correctness"
"To handle this problem, the notion of raise-consistency was introduced in [13]_CITE"
"In [13,_Section_5]_CITE the improvement of quasi-compatibility is introduced, which relaxes the compatibility criterion and therefore allows to reduce the size of the automata"
the remark between Definitions 32 and 33 in [13]_CITE
"These are used in CeTA [18]_CITE, a certifier for several properties related to term rewriting."
"Note that in both cases, we did not define new recursive functions, but just proved equalities which are treated as function definitions by Isabelle's code generator [10]_CITE."
"Consider the famous Lorenz system [60]_CITE (1)x = (y-x),y = x-y-xz,z =- z+xy,where , , are positive parameters."
"Consider the Chen system [12]_CITE (2)x =a(y-x),y =(c-a)x+cy-xz,z =-bz+xy and the Lu system [61]_CITE (3)x =a(y-x),y =cy-xz,z =-bz+xy,where a,b,c are real parameters"
"Leonov suggested to consider the following substitutions [35]_CITE (4)x hx,y hy,z hz,t h-1twith h=a"
"Remark that the transformation (4) with h=a does not change the direction of time for the positive chaotic parameters considered in the works [12,61]_CITE."
"Later, in 2013, the transformation (4) was independently considered in the works [2,3]_CITE 1Submission dates: [35] December 27, 2012; [2] 22 January 2013; [3] 22 January 2013"
"Note that here in contrast to the previous transformation: 1) the transformation (4) with h=-c change the direction of time for c>0 considered in the works [12,61]_CITE, 2) for c=0 the Chen and the Lu systems do not become linear and their dynamics may be of interest"
"For c=0 in [2,3]_CITE it is suggested to apply the previous transformation (4) with h=a and is claimed that the Chen and the Lu systems with c=0 are a particular case of the T-system [26,77]_CITE (which was published later) (7)x =a(y-x),y =(c-a)x-axz,z =-bz+xy.To fill the formal gap in the notation of the parameters in this case it is required the additional transformation x x/a,y y/a,z z/a"
"For the parameter set { , , }={10,28,8/3} it was found numerically a chaotic strange attractor in the Lorenz system [60]_CITE"
"Various rigorous approaches to the justification of its existence are based, for example, on the investigation of instability (hyperbolicity) of trajectories with the help of computing Lyapunov exponents, or the computation of attractor dimensions (see, eg, [27,19]_CITE and many others)"
"The Chen system with the parameter set {a,c,b}={35,28,3} is chaotic [12]_CITE, but it may not be chaotic for some other parameter"
"The Lu system with the parameter set {a,c,b}={36,20,3} is also chaotic [61]_CITE and, likewise, it may not be chaotic for any other parameter."
"On the other hand, we would like to recall the classical 16th Hilbert problem (second part, [23]_CITE) on the number and mutual disposition of limit cycles in two-dimensional polynomial systems, where one of the tasks is to find the simplest system, from a certain class, with the maximum possible number of limit cycles"
"Many chaotic polynomial systems have been discovered (eg, such particular cases of three-dimensional quadratic systems as the Lorenz, the Rossler, the Sprott, the Chen, the Lu and other systems) and studied over the years, but it is not known whether the algebraically simplest chaotic flow has been identified [73,72]_CITE"
"Thus, from a physical point of view, systems (5) and (6) are not particular cases of the Lorenz system since =-bc is negative in (5) and (6) for the case bc>0 considered in [12,61]_CITE and + <0 in (5) and =0 in (6)."
In [2]_CITE one can read: Chen attractor exists if Lorenz repulsor exist and most of the literature on the Chen system is redundant because the results obtained can be directly derived from the corresponding results on the Lorenz system .
"Generally speaking, for quadratic systems the existence of a trajectory on t [t0,+ ) does not imply its existence on t (- ,t0] (see, eg, examples from the paper [21]_CITE on the completeness of quadratic polynomial systems or the classical example x =x2)."
"Recall that in the case c=0 in [2,3,11]_CITE there is remarked that the Chen and the Lu systems are only a particular case of the T-system, which was published in 2004 [77]_CITE (ie later than the Chen and the Lu systems were published)"
For =13.9 this stable manifold contains a homoclinic orbit [27]_CITE
So-called Shilnikov chaos exists in three-dimensional dynamical systems with a homoclinic trajectory of a saddle point of equilibrium if this equilibrium is a saddle-focus with a positive saddle value [70]_CITE
"Nevertheless in [37]_CITE it is shown that a small change of all these systems in a neighborhood of a saddle can lead to the satisfaction of all conditions of the Shilnikov theorem and, consequently, to Shilnikov chaos in the Lorenz, the Chen, and the Lu systems"
Consequently the bounded set cannot be positively invariant and it is not dissipative in the sense of Levinson [49]_CITE.
"The mathematical tools, developed independently by Douady Oesterle [20]_CITE and Ilyashenko [25]_CITE, permitted one to obtain the following extension of the Liouville theorem and to estimate the Hausdorff dimension of K"
In the work [43]_CITE it is introduced Lyapunov functions in the estimates of the form (18) and proved the following result
5 The estimate from above of the Lyapunov dimension by Lyapunov functions [36]_CITE and its comparison with the local Lyapunov dimension in zero stationary point permit one to obtain the exact formula of dimension for a generalized Lorenz system (9) with a certain parameter d
"8 Recent examples of hidden attractors can be found in [10,28,34,52,57,58,65,66,79,80,83,84]_CITE"
"Leonov in his work [35]_CITE demonstrated by the transformation x hx,y hy,z hz,t h-1t with h=a that without loss of generality nonlinear Chen and the Lu systems can be considered as two-parametric systems (for a=0 the Chen and the Lu systems become linear and their dynamics have minor interest)"
"Later, in 2013, in the works [2,3]_CITE the transformation with h=-c was applied to transform the Chen and Lu systems for c>0 to the form of the Lorenz system (here for c=0 the Chen and the Lu systems do not become linear and can be transformed by the transformation with h=a to the T-system which was published later)"
"While Lyapunov dimension of the Lorenz attractor can be obtained analytically [47]_CITE, for the Chen and Lu attractors it is still an open problem"
"The Chen system is a special case of the Lorenz system and The Lu system is a particular case of the Lorenz system of [2,3]_CITE may lead to the conclusion that the study of the Chen and the Lu systems is useless, the Chen and the Lu systems stimulate the development of new methods for the analysis of chaotic systems."
The estimate from above of the Lyapunov dimension by Lyapunov functions [36]_CITE and its comparison with the local Lyapunov dimension in zero stationary point permit one to obtain the exact formula of dimension for a generalized Lorenz system (9) with a certain parameter d
This problem is a generalization of the Longest Common Substring problem [2 4]_CITE and is similar to the threshold all-against-all problem defined by Gusfield [2]_CITE and to the local alignment problem of biological sequence analysis
"|S2|) time using the Smith Waterman algorithm [5]_CITE, the goal is to compute a pair of substrings of S1 and S2 such that the corresponding similarity, according to a suitable scoring function, is maximum over all the pairs of substrings"
Babenko and Starikovskaya [1]_CITE studied the case of 1 mismatch only and presented an algorithm for the 1-LCF problem which runs in O(|S1|
"The matching statistics, introduced by Chang and Lawler [6]_CITE for the approximate string matching problem, is an array ms of |S2| integers such that ms[i] is the length of the longest substring of S2 that starts at position i and matches exactly some substring of S1, for i=0, ,|S2| 1"
"Recently, Leimeister and Morgenstern [7]_CITE presented a greedy heuristic for the computation of the matching statistics with k mismatches, which runs in O(|S1|"
"Assuming a constant size alphabet, the suffix tree can be built in O(|S|) time [2]_CITE"
The suffix tree can be preprocessed in O(|S|) time so as to answer LCA queries in constant time [9]_CITE
The binary suffix tree can be built in O(|S|) time [8]_CITE
"This can be improved such that the time requirement becomes proportional to the number of mismatches along the diagonal, by using the well-known technique that performs LCA queries on the generalized suffix tree of S1 and S2 to find, in constant time, how far the next mismatch is from the current one [10]_CITE"
"If the lists L1,L2 are implemented using AVL-trees, the time complexity of the merge and find-longest procedures is O(mlog (n/m)) [11]_CITE, where m=min (|L1|,|L2|),n=max (|L1|,|L2|), and the algorithm can be proved to run in O(|S|log |S|) time"
"In [5]_CITE, Kim constructed a nonlinear ordinary differential equation with respect to t which was related to the generating function of Eulerian polynomial"
"In [2]_CITE, Choi considered nonlinear ordinary differential equations with respect to u not t to obtain different identities on Eulerian polynomial."
"In [3]_CITE, Choi et al solved the first order partial differential equation to determine coefficients of Nth order ordinary differential equation"
Goto [3]_CITE gave a minimal time solution using several thousands of states
"Moreover, it has been shown [5]_CITE that any solution needs at least five states"
"The FSSP has been studied on a ring of n cells [9]_CITE, and on arrays of two and three dimensions [10,11]_CITE"
The FSSP with multi-generals [12 14]_CITE has also been studied
The FSSPs for Cayley graphs [15]_CITE and another particular class of graphs [16]_CITE have also been studied
"Some constrained variants of the FSSP have been developed to find solutions on reversible (ie, backward deterministic) cellular automata [17]_CITE and cellular automata with a number-conserving property (ie, a state is a tuple of non-negative integers whose sum is constant) [18]_CITE"
"Other kinds of constraints which have been considered involve the amount of information exchange between any pair of adjacent cells [19,20]_CITE."
An outline of a minimal time solution (Waksman algorithm [4]_CITE) of the FSSP is as follows.
"Although these technological advances have positive influences in meeting the ever stringent emission legislations, they also introduce broadband, high amplitude torsional oscillations into the lightweight powertrains with potential effects on durability, overall efficiency and poor NVH performance [1 4]_CITE"
"In order to attenuate the torsional oscillations, various palliative measures have been implemented in industry, including Clutch pre-dampers (CD) [5]_CITE, Dual Mass Flywheel (DMF) [2]_CITE and DMF with Centrifugal Pendulum Absorbers (CPAs)."
Bertin et al [6]_CITE performed a comparative study of the performance of radial DMF against a conventional one
Cavina and Serra [7]_CITE studied the effect of the DMF on the vehicle NVH characteristics
Theodossiades et al [8]_CITE examined experimentally the effect of the DMF on impact-induced noise in a rear wheel drive light truck
Sun et al [9]_CITE performed a study of nonlinear characteristics of a DMF with radial springs with the objective of optimising key parameters for its improved performance
"Other studies include DMFs with magnetorheological damper [10]_CITE, variable stiffness [11]_CITE and arc helix spring [2,12]_CITE"
"Magneto-rheological dampers as visco-lock devices have also been developed and used for NVH refinement in the driveline systems of all wheel drive vehicles [13]_CITE, where they can act in combined squeeze and shear, attenuating coupled torsional and axial vibrations [14]_CITE"
"With the objective of further enhancing the effectiveness of the DMF a new type of tuned passive absorber, namely, a DMF with CPA [15 17]_CITE, was used at a cost of increased weight for the potential gains in further suppression of vibration energy during specific drive manoeuvres [18]_CITE."
"TET is a phenomenon, where mechanical (vibration) energy is transferred (in a nearly irreversible manner) from a source (primary structure) to an essentially nonlinear attachment (the NES), where it is partially absorbed, partially redistributed in the frequency domain, and/or dissipated locally [19]_CITE"
"First, a NES induces energy redistribution within the modal space of the primary structure by scattering the vibrating energy initially concentrated at lower frequency modes into higher frequency ones, where it is dissipated more effectively due to the higher damping capacity of the higher-frequency modes [20]_CITE; moreover, the low-to-high frequency vibration energy transfers rapidly reduce the response amplitude of the primary structure"
"Second, a NES effectively absorbs the undesired vibratory energy through its oscillations with no preferential natural frequency (since it lacks a linear stiffness part) in a nearly irreversible form, providing another way to reduce the vibration amplitudes of the primary structure [21,22]_CITE."
"Gendelman et al [23]_CITE and Vakakis et al [24,25]_CITE studied NES in two, three and multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems"
Vakakis et al [26]_CITE studied the Nonlinear Normal Modes (NNMs) to classify the interaction of NES with the modes of a primary linear system
Jiang et al [27]_CITE studied the effect of NES on the steady-state dynamics of a weakly coupled system
Panagopoulos et al [28]_CITE studied the transient resonant interactions of a finite number of linear oscillators coupled to a NES
"Tsakirtzis et al [29]_CITE studied the transient resonant interactions of TET, whilst Kerschen et al [30]_CITE conducted parametric studies to understand the dynamics of energy pumping"
McFarland et al [20]_CITE performed investigations in structures with grounded and ungrounded non-linear attachments
Georgiadis et al [31]_CITE studied the shock isolation properties of a linear system coupled to a nonlinear attachment with clearance nonlinearity
Jiang and Vakakis [32]_CITE studied the steady state dynamics of systems coupled with smooth and non-smooth strong nonlinearities
Karayannis et al [33]_CITE studied the use of a vibro-impact attachment as a shock absorber
The application of a torsional NES to stabilise a drill-string system was examined in [34]_CITE
Gendelman et al [35]_CITE studied numerically and experimentally the dynamics of an eccentric rotational NES mounted inside a linear oscillator
Sigalov et al [36]_CITE expanded the study of Gendelman et al [35]_CITE by analysing the resonance captures and NNMs of the system
Hubbard et al [37]_CITE performed an experimental study on suppressing aeroelastic instabilities of a flexible swept wing using a rotational NES
"The phenomenon is commonly referred to as clonk in industry [8,38,39]_CITE with a negative effect on customer comfort"
"On the lower spectral content clutch in-cycle vibration [40]_CITE and transmission rattle induced by the repetitive impact of unloaded gear teeth pairs [4,41 44]_CITE are both torsional or coupled axial-torsional NVH concerns, which are currently palliated to some extent by the various mass-dampers, slip devices (to dissipate the excess energy) or by the DMF"
"A recent study by Haris et al [45]_CITE demonstrated numerically that the NES with purely cubic stiffness can be used efficiently in automotive drivetrains to attenuate torsional vibrations over a broad frequency spectrum; this can be targeted towards attenuation of idle transmission rattle, which is of particular concern with transmitted engine order torsional vibrations to the clutch-transmission system"
"For the frequency domain, the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) method is used to obtain the transient spectral content at the various Engine Order (EO) harmonics (these are the multiples of the crankshaft's rotational speed [5]_CITE)"
"For the 3-cylinder 4-stroke engine investigated here, the 1.5 EO harmonic is the most significant contribution to the oscillatory response [5]_CITE"
"Schaeffler [46]_CITE reported that using centrifugal pendulum-type absorbers for three-cylinder engines, acceptable acceleration values of 500 rad/s for engine speed of 1000 rpm are attainable"
"Then, it is possible to achieve angular acceleration amplitudes below 200 rad/s from engine speeds of 800 rpm upwards [46]_CITE"
"Using the pre-defined ranges of nonlinear stiffness coefficient and the NES inertia, a contour plot is shown in Fig._7_CITE"
"Furthermore, the results presented in [25,31,33]_CITE concluded that broadband vibration suppression could only be achieved through the use of vibro-impact (VI) NES or higher orders of smooth nonlinearity."
"First, the amplitude of oscillations of the NES should be large enough to overcome the clearance limit and to be able to interact with the spring kN [31]_CITE"
Higher clearance values are not a feasible option as no vibro-impacts can occur [33]_CITE
"It is noteworthy that the attenuation of low frequencies is of particular interest in the palliation of the transmission rattle [4,41 44]_CITE.The AEAAR results are summarized in the three contour plots of Fig_12 and the optimal cases (where the AEAAR becomes maximum) are listed in Table 2."
Load signature analysis has long been used for process control and monitoring in a variety of induction heating and melting applications [1]_CITE
"Time-dependent electromagnetic observables include current and voltage, phase angle between current and voltage, and frequency of the applied voltage [1]_CITE."
"As examples, experimental studies have been reported on the use of load signature analysis to improve process control in induction hardening of steel [2,3]_CITE and for heating of aluminum plates [4]_CITE"
Many of these studies use detailed finite element analysis (FEA) of the coupled thermal and electromagnetic problem to quantify changes in the impedance of the tank circuit as the electrical and magnetic properties of the heated material change throughout the heating process [3 6]_CITE
These impedance changes throughout the heating cycle are responsible for changing the electromagnetic observables during heating [4]_CITE
"With these assumptions, the magnetic field in a cylindrical object heated by a close-coupled coil is governed by [11]_CITE, (1)d2Hdr2+1rdHdr j H=0,where j= 1"
"The magnetic field is symmetric about the r-axis, and the field is imposed at the surface of the cylinder, or, (3)H(r=R)=HsanddHdr|r=0=0.The magnetic field at the outermost surface of the load, Hs is set equal to the magnetic field in the gap between the coil and the load [11]_CITE"
"The coefficient is evaluated from [12]_CITE, namely, (5)Kn=K n(1 R2b2)+R2b2,where K n is the Nagaoka coefficient for a finite-length coil with an air core, which can be estimated from [13]_CITE, (6)K n=1+1.535604 2+0.273728 41+1.035808 2 8 3 ,with =b/l"
"An exact solution to Eq (7), where the magnetic field is represented by Bessel functions, is well documented for induction heating of cylinders [11]_CITE"
A multiple-scale analysis is used to solve the problem [14]_CITE
These approximate expressions for the Poynting vector are compared to the exact solution given by Davies [11]_CITE
We assume that a series resonant voltage source converter is used and that control is achieved by controlling the frequency of the inverter [15]_CITE
"The inductance of the air gap can be evaluated by using the formula for the self-inductance of a short air-filled solenoid [16]_CITE, (39)LAG= nlAdHs/dtdI/dt= n2lAKn,where A is the cross-sectional area of air"
A number of studies have established methods for using the finite element method to solve and optimize the coupled multiphysics induction heating problem [17 19]_CITE
"Based on this geometry, we estimate the inductance of conductors between the power supply and coil to be Lcir=0.87 H [16]_CITE"
"Values for graphite density and temperature dependent thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and specific heat are obtained from values reported for POCO AXM-5Q ultrafine grain graphite [20]_CITE"
"Previous authors have used perturbation methods to approximate fields in induction heating applications [21]_CITE; however, the asymptotic solutions were used to simplify numerical simulations of complex geometries, never to give a complete description of the electromagnetic field in the heated object"
"Program dependence analysis is a foundation for many activities in software engineering such as testing, comprehension, and impact analysis ( Binkley,_2007_CITE)"
"For example, it is essential to understand the relationships between different parts of a system when making changes and the impacts of these changes ( Gallagher_and_Lyle,_1991_CITE)"
"This has led to both static ( Yau_and_Collofello,_1985;_Black,_2001_CITE) and blended (static and dynamic) ( Ren_et_al.,_2006,_2005_CITE) dependence analyses of the relationships between dependence and impact."
"In previous work ( Binkley_and_Harman,_2005_CITE), we introduced the study of dependence clusters in terms of program slicing and demonstrated that large dependence clusters were (perhaps surprisingly) common, both in production (closed source) code and in open source code ( Harman_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"More recently, our finding that large clusters are widespread in C systems has been replicated for other languages and systems by other authors, both in open source and in proprietary code ( Acharya_and_Robinson,_2011;_Besz des_et_al.,_2007;_Szegedi_et_al.,_2007_CITE)"
"Large dependence clusters were also found in Java systems ( Besz des_et_al.,_2007;_Savernik,_2007;_Szegedi_et_al.,_2007_CITE) and in legacy Cobol systems ( Hajnal_and_Forg cs,_2011_CITE)."
"For example, it may lead to problems for on-going software maintenance and evolution ( Acharya_and_Robinson,_2011;_Binkley_et_al.,_2008;_Savernik,_2007_CITE)"
"As a result, refactoring has been proposed as a technique for breaking larger clusters of dependence into smaller clusters ( Binkley_and_Harman,_2005;_Black_et_al.,_2009_CITE)."
"Informally, mutually-dependent clusters are maximal sets of program statements that mutually depend upon one another ( Harman_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"A well known approximation is based on Weiser's program slice ( Weiser,_1984_CITE): a slice is the set of program statements that affect the values computed at a particular statement of interest (referred to as a slicing criterion)"
"One such algorithm computes a slice as the solution to a reachability problem over a program's System Dependence Graph (SDG) ( Horwitz_et_al.,_1990_CITE)"
"A data dependence connects a definition of a variable with each use of the variable reached by the definition ( Ferrante_et_al.,_1987_CITE)"
"Control dependence connects a predicate p to a vertex v when p has at least two control-flow-graph successors, one of which can lead to the exit vertex without encountering v and the other always leads eventually to v ( Ferrante_et_al.,_1987_CITE)"
"Examples of such features include procedures ( Horwitz_et_al.,_1990_CITE) and threads ( Krinke,_1998_CITE)"
"Fortunately, context-sensitive slicing captures the necessary context information ( Binkley_and_Harman,_2005,_2003;_Horwitz_et_al.,_1990;_Krinke,_2002,_2003_CITE)."
"Therefore, the clustering problem is the NP-Hard maximal cliques problem ( Bomze_et_al.,_1999_CITE) making Definition 2.2 prohibitively expensive to implement."
"An alternative definition uses the same-slice relation in place of slice inclusion ( Binkley_and_Harman,_2005_CITE)"
"The first visualization, the Monotone Slice-size Graph (MSG) ( Binkley_and_Harman,_2005_CITE), plots a landscape of monotonically increasing slice sizes where the y-axis shows the size of each slice, as a percentage of the entire program, and the x-axis shows each slice, in monotonically increasing order of slice size"
"The second visualization, the Slice/Cluster Size Graph (SCG) ( Islam_et_al.,_2010b_CITE), alleviates this issue by combining both slice and cluster sizes"
"This is followed by a series of four case studies, where qualitative analysis, aided by the decluvi cluster visualization tool ( Islam_et_al.,_2010a_CITE), highlight how knowledge of clusters can aid a software engineer"
"The cluster visualizations were generated by decluvi ( Islam_et_al.,_2010a_CITE) using data extracted from CodeSurfer"
"The study considers the 30 C programs shown in Table 1 , which provides a brief description of each program alongside seven measures: number of files containing executable C code, LoC lines of code (as counted by the Unix utility wc), SLoC the non-comment non-blank lines of code (as counted by the utility sloccount ( Wheeler,_2004_CITE)), ELoC the number of source code lines that CodeSurfer considers to contain executable code, the number of SDG vertices, the number of SDG edges, the number of slices produced, and finally the size (as a percentage of the program's SDG vertex count) of the largest coherent cluster"
"In the future we plan to upgrade the tooling with optimizations for fast and massive slicing ( Binkley_et_al.,_2007_CITE) and to merge the clustering phase into the slicing to reduce the runtime significantly."
"Pointer analysis plays a key role in the precision of slicing and the interplay between pointer analysis and downstream dependence analysis precision is complex ( Shapiro_and_Horwitz,_1997_CITE)"
"At the Medium and High settings, CodeSurfer performs extensive pointer analysis using the algorithm proposed by Fahndrich_et_al._(1998)_CITE, which implements a variant of Andersen's pointer analysis algorithm ( Andersen,_1994_CITE) (this includes parameter aliasing)"
Weiser_(1984)_CITE considers smaller slices to be better
"Slice size is often used to measure the impact of the analysis' precision ( Shapiro_and_Horwitz,_1997_CITE), similarly we also use slice size as a measure of precision."
"This is, however, a significant improvement over previous use of slice size as the hash value, which is only 78.3% accurate in the strict case of zero tolerance for variation in slice contents ( Binkley_and_Harman,_2005_CITE)."
"Functions with code from multiple clusters reduce code separation (hindering comprehension) and increase the likelihood of ripple-effects ( Black,_2001_CITE)"
"Although the coherent cluster still shows the structure of the program and includes all these stub functions that work together, this is a clear case of dependence pollution ( Binkley_and_Harman,_2005_CITE), which is avoidable"
"Thus a large dependence cluster might be thought of as a bad code smell ( Elssamadisy_and_Schalliol,_2002_CITE) or a anti-pattern ( Binkley_et_al.,_2008_CITE)"
Black_et_al._(2006)_CITE suggested that dependence clusters are potentially where bugs may be located and suggested the possibility of a link between clusters and program faults
"Each update was manually checked using CVSAnaly ( Robles_et_al.,_2004_CITE) to determine whether the update was a bug fix or simply an enhancement or upgrade to the system"
"In testing, dependence analysis has been shown to be effective at reducing the computational effort required to automate the test-data generation process ( Ali_et_al.,_2010_CITE)"
"This can be achieved by measuring the impact of the proposed change ( Black,_2001_CITE) or by attempting to identify portions of code for which a change can be safely performed free from side effects ( Gallagher_and_Lyle,_1991;_Tonella,_2003_CITE)"
"A recently proposed impact analysis framework ( Acharya_and_Robinson,_2011_CITE) reports that impact sets are often part of large dependence clusters when using time consuming but high precision slicing"
"There has also been recent work on finding dependence communities in software ( Hamilton_and_Danicic,_2012_CITE) where social network community structure detection algorithms are applied to slice-inclusion graphs to identify communities."
"Dependence clusters have previously been linked to software faults ( Black_et_al.,_2006_CITE) and have been identified as a potentially harmful dependence anti-pattern ( Binkley_et_al.,_2008_CITE)"
"A study of 21 programs found that 50% of the programs had a global variable that was responsible for holding together large dependence clusters ( Binkley_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Other work on dependence clusters in software engineering has considered clusters at both low-level ( Binkley_and_Harman,_2005;_Harman_et_al.,_2009_CITE) (SDG based) and high-level ( Eisenbarth_et_al.,_2003;_Mitchell_and_Mancoridis,_2006_CITE) (models and functions) abstractions."
"While engineers needed to be aware of them, it remains a subject of much debate as to whether or not they should be refactored, tolerated or even nurtured ( Bouktif_et_al.,_2006;_Kapser_and_Godfrey,_2008_CITE)."
"The SeeSys System ( Baker_and_Eick,_1995_CITE) introduced tree maps to show hierarchical data"
"With emerging pervasive applications in mind such as sensor networks, RFID tags and medical devices, a variety of lightweight cryptographic algorithms have been lately proposed including the two block ciphers adopted as ISO/IEC standard for lightweight encryption: PRESENT [7]_CITE proposed at CHES 2007 and CLEFIA [8]_CITE proposed at FSE 2007"
National Security Agency (NSA) has very recently contributed to the trend with two lightweight block ciphers: Simon and Speck [1]_CITE
HIGHT [6]_CITE is another lightweight block cipher designed with governmental involvement Korea Information Security Agency (KISA).
HIGHT was proposed at CHES 2006 and then adopted as ISO standard block cipher [9]_CITE
Zhang et al [10]_CITE present an integral attack on 22-round HIGHT at CANS 2009 and the time complexity is then reduced by Sasaki and Wang [11]_CITE at SAC 2012
"In the impossible differential cryptanalysis of HIGHT, to be able to cryptanalyze more rounds, most of the existing attacks do not consider the pre-whitening key except the attack on 27-round HIGHT given in [14]_CITE at AfricaCrypt 2012"
Lu [12]_CITE gives the first impossible differential cryptanalysis against 25-round HIGHT
"Then at ACISP 2009, zen et al [13]_CITE successfully mount an impossible differential attack on 26-round HIGHT"
"Note that the attack on 27-round HIGHT with full whitening keys considered proposed in [14]_CITE has time complexity 2 126.6 encryptions and 2 120 memory accesses to a table of 2 120 bytes, which can be considered marginal with respect to brute force"
"In the related-key setting, attacks on 28-round [12]_CITE and 31-round [13]_CITE HIGHT were presented using impossible differential attack and related-key rectangle attack on the full HIGHT was reported in [17]_CITE"
"Recently, independent biclique attacks belonging to the class of polynomial advantage attacks on the full HIGHT have been obtained in [15,16]_CITE with time complexities 2 126.4 and 2 125.9 encryptions, respectively."
"In a follow-up work at AsiaCrypt 2012 [2]_CITE, fundamental links of integral cryptanalysis to zero-correlation cryptanalysis have been revealed"
"At SAC 2013 [3]_CITE, an FFT technique for speeding up the key recovery in zero-correlation attacks has been proposed, which resulted in increasing the number of rounds that can be cryptanalyzed for Camellia-128 and Camellia-192 in the single-key setting."
"As mentioned above, in the single-key setting, the attack on the highest number of HIGHT rounds is the 27-round impossible differential attack of [14]_CITE"
"In this section, we briefly recall the basic concepts of zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis based on [4]_CITE and [2]_CITE."
"In [2]_CITE, Bogdanov et al proposed a multidimensional zero-correlation linear distinguisher using zero-correlation linear approximations and requiring O(2n/ ) known plaintexts, where n is the block size of a cipher"
"After much discussion about the idiosyncrasies of the many methods that were proposed, the conversation shifted to the relative merits of plan-driven and agile methods, the need to have a balanced approach, the circumstances under which each would be more appropriate, and so forth (for example, see Boehm_and_Turner,_2004_CITE)"
"The early research on agile focused, quite understandably, on issues related to the adoption of agile methods (eg, Boehm,_2002;_Nerur_et_al.,_2005_CITE) and on the efficacy of pairs vis- -vis individuals in software development ( Nawrocki_and_Wojciechowski,_2001;_Williams_et_al.,_2000_CITE)"
"Other studies have investigated various aspects of team dynamics -eg, trust, self-organization, and communication) ( Moe_et_al.,_2009_CITE), consequences of test-driven development ( Erdogmus_et_al.,_2005;_Janzen_and_Saiedian,_2005_CITE), adoption and post-adoption issues ( Cao_et_al.,_2009;_Mangalaraj_et_al.,_2009_CITE), challenges of implementing agile in distributed settings ( Ramesh_et_al.,_2006_CITE), and the like"
"While individual principles and practices of agile development were not entirely new to the software community, the way in which they were put together into a cogent theoretical and practical framework was certainly novel ( Williams_and_Cockburn,_2003_CITE)"
"At its core, agility entails ability to rapidly and flexibly create and respond to change in the business and technical domains ( Henderson-Sellers_and_Serour,_2005;_Highsmith_and_Cockburn,_2001_CITE)"
"Other aspects of agility explored include lightness or leanness (ie, having minimal formal processes) ( Cockburn,_2007_CITE) and related concepts such as nimbleness, quickness, dexterity, suppleness or alertness ( Erickson_et_al.,_2005_CITE)"
"In essence, these ideas suggest a light methodology that promotes manoeuvrability and speed of response ( Cockburn,_2007_CITE)."
"For Henderson-Sellers_and_Serour_(2005)_CITE, agility involves both the ability to adapt to different changes and to refine and fine-tune development processes as needed"
Lee_and_Xia_(2010)_CITE define software development agility as the software team's capability to efficiently and effectively respond to and incorporate user requirement changes during the project life cycle
Conboy_(2009)_CITE provides by far the most comprehensive definition of software development agility by systematically examining its various facets and definitions from related disciplines
"Thus, Conboy_(2009,_p._340)_CITE defines software development agility as the continued readiness to rapidly or inherently create change, proactively or reactively embrace change, and learn from change while contributing to perceived customer value (economy, quality, and simplicity), through its collective components and relationships with its environment."
"While leanness emphasizes cost reduction through eliminating waste and inefficiencies, agility treats leanness ie, cost reduction through waste elimination as a qualifier to focus more heavily on creating effective responses and valuable outcomes ( Agarwal_et_al.,_2006_CITE)"
Lyytinen_and_Rose_(2006)_CITE suggest that agility is achieved through learning processes involving both exploration and exploitation
"Indeed, experts in bibliometric studies, such as McCain_(1990)_CITE, White_and_Griffith_(1981)_CITE, and White_(1990)_CITE, have elaborated on the use of co-citation analysis to delineate the conceptual underpinnings of disciplines"
"Specifically, researchers have used either authors (eg, Nerur_et_al.,_2008_CITE) or documents (eg, Ramos-Rodr guez_and_Ru z-Navarro,_2004_CITE) as the units of analysis"
The procedure followed is very consistent with those outlined by McCain_(1990)_CITE and Nerur_et_al._(2008)_CITE
"Sharp and Robinson distinguish themselves by their work on XP, particularly in the context of organizational culture, distributed cognition, and the role of physical artefacts in agile development (see Sharp_and_Robinson,_2006,_2008;_Sharp_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"For instance, Nerur_and_Balijepally_(2007)_CITE illustrate that the shifts in the approach to software development reflected in the agile methods has parallels to similar shifts in design thinking evident in several disparate fields, eg, architecture and strategic management domains"
"Introductions to and overviews of agile development are provided by Abrahamsson_et_al._(2002)_CITE, Cohen_et_al._(2004)_CITE, Erickson_et_al._(2005)_CITE, and Dyb _and_Dings yr_(2008)_CITE"
"In addition, the book, Agile Software Development: Current Research and Future Directions ( Dings yr_et_al.,_2010_CITE), contains eleven overviews of the main streams within agile research, structured in chapters explaining foundations and background of agile development, agile methods in practice, and principal challenges and new frontiers."
"In 2003, Williams_and_Cockburn_(2003)_CITE edited a special issue in Computer titled, Agile Software Development: It's about Feedback and Change"
"The second special issue appeared in the Journal of Database Management in 2005 ( Siau,_2005_CITE)"
"In 2009, Abrahamsson_et_al._(2009)_CITE selected seven articles for a special issue in the European Journal of Information Systems to further our understanding of various phenomena in agile system development"
"Finally, in 2011, Dyb _(2011)_CITE edited a special section in the Journal of Information and Software Technology, based on best papers from the XP2010 conference"
"For example, there are meta-studies summarizing experiments on pair programming, with focus on effectiveness ( Dyb _et_al.,_2007_CITE) and on use in university education ( Salleh_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"At Agile2008, Dings yr_et_al._(2008)_CITE suggested a roadmap for research on agile software development, focusing on providing more empirical research, primarily on experienced agile teams and organizations, connecting better to existing streams of research in more established fields, giving more attention to management-oriented approaches, and finally give more emphasis to core ideas in agile software development in order to increase our understanding."
"gerfalk_et_al._(2009)_CITE in their introductory article to the special issue on agile/distributed systems development, compiled a top-ten list of future research areas"
"At the XP2010 conference, Freudenberg_and_Sharp_(2010)_CITE compiled a list of top ten burning questions based on feedback from practitioners"
"As Jacobson_and_Spence_(2009)_CITE point out, sound theoretical roots help us glean the essential concepts, or the truths of software development that are methodology-independent"
"It can be defined as the minimal total cost of a sequence of elementary edit operations to transform one sequence into the other; for a sequence x of length m and a sequence y of length n, it can be computed in time O(mn) [8]_CITE."
"In [21]_CITE, the authors show that computing the edit distance can be used to classify handwritten digits, where the contours of the digits are represented with an 8-direction chain-code [11]_CITE; a sequence over an eight-letter alphabet, representing the eight cardinal directions that the contour faces when following the outline of an image in a clockwise motion."
Example applications where image retrieval is required include digital libraries and multimedia editing [28]_CITE
"This can identify similarities in shapes which appear to be distinct from one another [20,26]_CITE."
"For instance, the linearised human (NC 001807) and chimpanzee (NC 001643) mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences do not start in the same region [13]_CITE"
"This motivates the design of efficient algorithms that are specifically devoted to the comparison of circular sequences [1,4,5,13]_CITE."
"The extended Bunke and Buhler method ( EBBA) computes an estimation of the upper bound for the exact cyclic edit distance, also in time O(mn) [22]_CITE"
"The weighted Bunke and Buhler algorithm ( WeBBA) combines the lower and upper bound estimations, computed by the BBA and EBBA algorithms, to produce an approximation of the cyclic edit distance in time O(mn) [23]_CITE"
Palazon-Gonzalez and Marzal [27]_CITE studied the same problem but from the indexing point of view for classification and retrieval
The first one modifies the branch and bound algorithm of Barrachina and Marzal [2]_CITE by avoiding exploring ranges known to be lower than the lower bound in the branch and bound computation
"Informally, the q-gram similarity, defined as a distance in [29]_CITE, is the number of q-grams shared by the two sequences"
The rotation of x that minimises a generalisation of the q-gram distance between x and y is computed using the algorithm in [13]_CITE;
"We begin with a few definitions, following Crochemore et al [8]_CITE"
"In many applications, we only want to count the number of edit operations, considering the cost of each to be 1 [17]_CITE"
"The cyclic edit distance, denoted by CE( x, y), is defined as CE(x,y)=mini(minj E(xi,yj))=mini E(xi,y) [18]_CITE."
Jokinen and Ukkonen [15]_CITE showed the following bound which is directly applicable to the Levenshtein distance
"For a given integer parameter 1, Grossi et al [13]_CITE defined a generalisation of the q-gram distance by partitioning x and y in blocks as evenly as possible, and computing the q-gram distance between each pair of blocks, one from x and one from y"
"The algorithm is based on constructing the suffix array [19]_CITE for string xxy and assigning a rank to the prefix with length q of each suffix with length at least q, based on its order in the suffix array"
"Myers bit-vector algorithm is used to compute the edit distance when using unit costs for insertion, deletion, and substitution [24]_CITE"
The space complexity is O( m+n); the edit distance and Needleman Wunsch algorithms can both be implemented in O(m+n) space [8]_CITE.
"This was calculated by identifying the number of direction changes between two adjacent elements of the chain-code in an anticlockwise direction (see [12]_CITE, for details)."
"For instance, algorithm hCED can now be directly used for computing the cyclic edit distance between all pairs of sequences for progressive multiple circular sequence alignment [3]_CITE."
"High-dimensional time-series data are becoming increasingly abundant across a wide variety of domains, spanning economics [13]_CITE, neuroscience [10]_CITE, and cosmology [28]_CITE"
"In practice, however, for many LDS s, the parameters are unknown and must be estimated in a process often called system identification [17]_CITE"
"However, it would lead to additional costs and set-up burden, as it would require a Spark cluster [29]_CITE."
"A static LDS model with a diagonal R is equivalent to Factor Analysis, while one with multiples of the identity R matrix leads to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [21]_CITE."
"Specifically, one way to search for the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is through iterative methods such as Expectation-Maximization (EM) [22]_CITE"
"An alternative is to use subspace identification methods such as N4SID and PCA-ID, which give asymptotically unbiased closed-form solutions [8,27]_CITE"
"In practice, determining an initial solution with subspace identification and then refining it with EM is an effective approach [6]_CITE."
"Using a vectorization trick as in [25]_CITE, one can derive C closed form solution with the Tikhonov regularization [24]_CITE (7)Cnew=SolvewithTikhonovregularization"
"However, it can be solved numerically with a Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) [5]_CITE"
"The Kirby 21 data were acquired from the FM Kirby Research Center at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, an affiliate of Johns Hopkins University [16]_CITE"
"The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is a systematic effort to map macroscopic human brain circuits and their relationship to behavior in a large population of healthy adults [9,18,26]_CITE"
"The Amari error [2]_CITE, which is another permutation-invariant measure of similarity, is also provided"
"As an example, the blue region in Fig_3 accurately matches the dorsomedial (DM) parcel of the five-region parcellation proposed by Nebel MB et al [19]_CITE."
"The covariance structures in the observation equation, R, should be generalized and prior knowledge could be incorporated into it [1]_CITE"
"Mohammad et al have discussed the impact of autocorrelation on functional connectivity, which also provides some direction for extension [3]_CITE"
"In the mechanical and mathematical literature concerning the models for piezoviscous hydrodynamic thin film lubrication problems, different classical devices have been considered, such as journal-bearings, rolling-bearings or rolling-ball-bearings (see [1]_CITE, for example)"
"In these more complex settings, this way of including piezoviscous regimes has given rise to several mathematical analysis results that state the existence and the uniqueness of solution, as well as to the design of suitable numerical methods to approximate the corresponding solutions, for which there are no analytical expressions (see, for example, [4 8]_CITE)."
"Barus law has been also used to model pressure dependence of viscosity in the original Stokes equation in [9]_CITE arguing also that Reynolds equation is only valid when the shear stress is much smaller than the reciprocal of the pressure viscosity coefficient, while later on in [10]_CITE a corrected Reynolds equation is obtained from Navier Stokes ones with pressure dependence of viscosity and in [11]_CITE a simpler derivation is obtained."
"As indicated in the review paper [13]_CITE and throughout the literature, cavitation is one of the most relevant features of lubrication problems"
A review concerning the mathematical and physical analysis of the different models is presented in [15]_CITE
"In order to compare the results with those ones appearing in [12]_CITE for the case of a rigid long rolling- cylinder, we introduce the angular coordinate, t, defined by the change of variable x=Rsin(t),t [- /2, /2],where R represents the radius of the cylinder"
"Furthermore, the Rajagopal and Szeri model in [12]_CITE may be also written in a similar way, although with the following slightly different expression of G: (33)G(t,p )=h 3e- p + h 22cos(t)dh 2dt1-nh 0cos(t)."
"Following some ideas in [12]_CITE, another alternative is to restart from the modified Reynolds equation (18), to integrate it and interpret the result as a kind of conservation equation for the flow rate Q given by (19)."
"In the variational inequality formulation in the forthcoming Section 5.1, existence and uniqueness is well known for the usual model with =0 (see [16]_CITE, for example)"
"For the spatial discretization we consider a classical piecewise linear Lagrange finite element space, so that the discretized problem consists of finding p hn+1 Kh, such that (38) - /2 /2G(t,p hn)(p hn+1) ( h-p hn+1) dt -6 - /2 /2h ( h-p hn+1)dt, h Kh,where Vh denotes the finite element space (see [22]_CITE, for example): Vh={ h C0( )/ h|E P1, E h},"
At this point we propose two alternatives to solve the discretized problem (38): a relaxation algorithm with projection on the convex set Kh first described in [19]_CITE and the duality type algorithm proposed in [20]_CITE for the numerical solution partial differential equations involving maximal monotone operators
"In order to apply the duality method in [20]_CITE, we introduce the indicatrix function of the convex Kh denoted by IKh, so that the variational inequality of first kind (38) can be transformed in the equivalent variational inequality of second kind that consists of finding p n+1 V0h, such that - /2 /2G(t,p n)(p n+1) ( -p n+1) dt+IKh( )-IKh(p n+1) -6 - /2 /2h ( -p n+1)dt, V0h.Moreover, we use the notation (Anp n+1, )= - /2 /2G(t,p n)(p n+1) ( -p n+1) dt,(fn, )=-6 - /2 /2h ( -p n+1)dt.Then, using the tools of subdifferential calculus, we obtain that (39) n+1=-(Anp n+1-fn) IK(p n+1),where IKh denotes the subdifferential of the indicatrix function"
"In order to apply the results in [20]_CITE, for a given parameter >0, we introduce the new variable (42) n+1 IKh(p n+1)- p n+1.In terms of this new variable n+1, the equivalent formulation to (40) (41) can be written in the form:"
"Then by using a lemma appearing in [20]_CITE, we have that (44) is equivalent to (45) n+1=K (p n+1+ n+1),where K denotes the Yosida approximation of the operator IKh- I with parameter >0, we drop the dependence on h for the operator K ."
"The idea is to make a comparative analysis of the different models, formulations and numerical schemes presented in the previous sections, mainly taking as a reference the data set of the numerical examples in [12]_CITE"
It seems that the results obtained with the numerical schemes here implemented for the Rajagopal and Szeri model are very similar to the solution presented in [12]_CITE
"The solution is to automate human surveillance ( Makris_and_Ellis,_2005_CITE)"
"Due to advances in pedestrian detection and robust tracking long term human centred tracks are becoming more prevalent ( Kalal_and_Matas,_2009;_Felzenszwalb_et_al.,_2010_CITE)"
"An abnormal event in automated surveillance is one which has a low statistical representation in the training data ( Loy,_2010_CITE)"
"In any non-trivial surveillance scene contextual information such as scene region, social context, periodic events, and entry or exit points impact the dynamics of behaviour ( Lan_and_Wang,_2010_CITE)"
"The scene regions provides an understanding of portions of the scene in which we would expect normal behaviours to be different from other areas ( Makris_and_Ellis,_2005_CITE)"
"Previous approaches such as Li et al develop a scene segmentation method which divides the scene into regions based upon behavioural dissimilarity ( Li_and_Xiang,_2008_CITE)"
"Similarly, Chen Loy segments a scene into spatial regions of similar behaviour by virtue of behaviour correlation ( Loy,_2010_CITE)"
"Wang et al uses a Dual Hierarchical Dirichlet Process to cluster behaviours spatially, learning both observation and trajectory clusters simultaneously ( Wang_and_Teck_Ma,_2008_CITE)"
"To estimate social groupings Ge et al uses a proximity and velocity metric to associate individuals into pairs, iteratively adding additional individuals to groups using the Hausdorff distance as a measure of closeness ( Ge_and_Ruback,_2009_CITE)"
"Yu et al implements a graph cuts based system which uses the feature of proximity alone ( Yu_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Oliver et al uses a Coupled HMM to construct a priori models of group events such as Follow-reach-walk together, or Approach-meet-go separately ( Oliver_and_Pentland,_1998_CITE)"
"Robertson and Reid utilise gaze direction in order to determine whether individuals are within each other field of view ( Robertson,_2011_CITE)"
"Gaze direction is significant as it departs from the use of motion features alone by taking into account visual interest ( Farenzena_and_Tavano,_2011_CITE)"
"Detection is achieved using the Felzenszwalb part based detector ( Felzenszwalb_et_al.,_2010_CITE)"
"Tracking of human targets in the image plane is achieved with the use of the Predator TLD tracker ( Kalal_and_Matas,_2009_CITE)"
"We select the TLD tracker due to high performance amongst state of the art trackers ( Kalal_and_Matas,_2010_CITE) and utilise its capability to learn a target model and discriminate between potential targets in a crowded surveillance scene"
"Scene context: Building upon the work of Makris_and_Ellis_(2005)_CITE our scene model consists of four potential regions: Traffic lanes, idle areas, convergence/divergence regions, and general area"
"The publicly available PETS 2007 dataset ( PETS2007_and_accessed,_2012_CITE) offers a source of multi camera real world surveillance footage"
Magyari and Keller [3]_CITE studied the steady boundary layers on an exponentially stretching continuous surface with an exponential temperature distribution
Wang [4]_CITE investigated the partial slip effects on the planar stretching flow

Another important aspect is the investigation of multiple solutions for hydrodynamic flow of a second grade fluid over a stretching or shrinking sheet by Van Gorder and Vajravelu [8]_CITE
Fang et al [9]_CITE considered the effects of second order slip on the flow of a shrinking sheet
The effect of radiation on the boundary layer flow and heat transfer of a viscous fluid over an exponentially stretching sheet is studied by Sajid and Hayat [10]_CITE
The exact analytical solutions for the flow and heat transfer over permeable stretching/shrinking surface taking into account a second order slip model is proposed by Turkilmazoglu [11]_CITE
In [12]_CITE Mukhopadhyay studied the boundary layer flow and heat transfer towards a porous exponential stretching sheet in presence of magnetic field and taking into account the velocity slip and thermal slip by means of numerical solutions obtained by shooting method.
"In what follows, we consider the two-dimensional laminar flow of an incompressible viscous electrically conducting fluid past a stretching sheet coinciding with the plane y=0, the flow being confined to y > 0 [10 12]_CITE"
"Introducing the similarity variables [12]_CITE, (9) =U02 Lex2Ly,u=U0ex2Lf ( )v= U02Lex2L[f( )+f ( )], ( )=T T T0e x2L"
"In what follows we do not solve Eq (23), but from the theory of differential equations, taking into considerations the method of variation of parameters, Cauchy method, method of influence function, the operator method [28]_CITE and so on, is more convenient to consider the unknown function f 1( ), in the form (26)f1( ,Cj)= i=1nHi( ,hj( ),Cj)gi( ),j=1, ,sB(f1( ,Ci),df1( ,Ci)d )=0where within expression of Hi( , hj( ), Cj) appear linear combinations of some functions hj, some terms which are given by the corresponding homogeneous equation and the unknown parameters Cj, j=1, ,s"
"In Table 6 are presented comparisons of our results with some available results of Ishak [29]_CITE and Mukhopadhyay [12]_CITE for different values of Prandtl number Pr and radiation number R and for =0, M=0, =0"
"The concept of concurrency in today computing is prevalent and can be found in, eg, hardware systems, programming languages, global computer networks, operating systems, and models of biochemical reactions in living cells [9,12,21,24,28]_CITE"
"For example, to describe the result of action refinement a suitable information about concurrency or independence between actions may be needed, as in the traces of [11]_CITE, resulting in a variant of causal partial orders semantics"
A key idea is that the behaviours of concurrent systems are represented by sequences of groups (or steps) of simultaneously executed activities [27]_CITE
"This fits well, eg, the operational behaviour of asynchronous circuits [13,23]_CITE and reaction systems [12]_CITE"
"The design and analysis of concurrent systems is very often concerned with fundamental behavioural properties involving system activities, including persistence as well as a complementary property of nonviolence [2,4]_CITE"
"A concurrent system is persistent [4,5,20]_CITE if no enabled activity can be prevented from being executed by any other activity"
"This is often a highly desirable property, in particular, in hardware systems [31]_CITE"
"Persistence is one of crucial properties in the design of asynchronous hardware [9]_CITE, and in the design of arbiter-free synchronisations [19]_CITE"
"Other areas where concepts related to persistence turned out to play a key role are, eg, continuous Petri nets, introduced as approximations for coping with the state explosion problem in the verification of discrete (standard) Petri nets [16,22]_CITE, and performance evaluation of discrete event systems [15]_CITE"
"Recently, in [13]_CITE we argued that such a notion of persistence is restricted and in dealing with the design of GALS systems one also needs to consider activities represented by sets of simultaneously executed transitions"
"Moving into the realm of step based execution semantics creates a wealth of new fundamental problems and intriguing questions, some of which have been addressed in [13,18]_CITE"
"Moreover, one may consider steps which are persistent and cannot be disabled by other steps, as well as steps which are nonviolent [2,4]_CITE and cannot disable other steps"
The decidability status of various notions of step based persistence and nonviolence has been investigated in [1]_CITE.
One of the main issues in asynchronous circuit design is the handling of hazards which can be interpreted as a violation of persistence [31]_CITE in models such as transition systems [17]_CITE or Petri nets [9]_CITE
"In [13]_CITE, we proposed such a notion and applied it in a procedure for turning reachability graphs of sequentially persistent safe nets into step persistent transition systems from which correct GALS circuits can be derived."
"We aim to classify different types of persistent and nonviolent steps taking pt-nets (Place/Transition nets) [26]_CITE to be the system model, revising and extending the results of [18]_CITE"
"Unlike in paper [13]_CITE, we do not allow empty steps"
"In its original form [20]_CITE, persistence is stated as a property of nets executed according to the sequential semantics"
"In the rest of the paper, if we say that a net is persistent we would mean persistent according to the original definition from [20]_CITE."
"Type- a nonviolence, as well as type- a persistence, can be defined in two different ways ( [13]_CITE)"
Moving from the sequential to step semantics changes the way we perceive the persistence of pt-nets introduced in [20]_CITE and recalled in Remark 3.4
We start by recalling some of the results from [13]_CITE
We start the discussion on type- a notions in safe pt-nets by recalling from [13]_CITE the sufficient conditions for a step to be g a-persistent or g a-nonviolent in terms of the transitions it contains
"In particular, we introduced a new notion of b-persistence and b-nonviolence that, unlike the one from [18]_CITE, does not coincide with one of the other two variants: a or c"
"In consequence, we proposed three distinct notions of step persistence and nonviolence making the new taxonomy richer and, at the same time, giving more choice, eg, to the designers of persistent GALS systems, or the developers of methods aimed at coping with the state space explosion similar to those proposed in [16]_CITE."
"Among the problems and issues we plan to investigate in future are the phenomenon of confusion formulated for steps rather than single transitions, and less restrictive notions of persistence and nonviolence, eg, the k-persistence of [3]_CITE"
"Also, we intend to lift the concept of conflict between transitions to the level of steps, and investigate the relationship between conflict-freeness and persistence in the framework of step semantics, similarly as it was done in [20]_CITE in the framework of sequential semantics."
"Despite assertions some thirty-five years ago that the future of operational research is past ( Ackoff,_1979_CITE), the techniques and methodologies are still taught in universities across the globe and regularly used in business decision-making, in both the public and private sectors"
"Many in the OR/MS community have cited the prominence of analytics as an opportunity that could promote the [ ] profession and expand its reach ( Liberatore_&_Luo,_2010,_p._313_CITE)"
"A recent survey of the membership of INFORMS, the US OR/MS society, found 79 percent supported expanding the society focus to include analytics ( Liberatore_&_Luo,_2011_CITE) and the organisation now offers analytics certification, a magazine on the subject, and an annual conference"
"Many organisations have changed the name of their departments to include analytics; such as IBM Business Analytics and Mathematical Sciences ( Sutor,_2013_CITE) and Proctor and Gamble Global Analytics ( Ericson,_2006_CITE) teams"
"Chen,_Chiang,_and_Storey_(2012)_CITE report the publication of 126 academic articles in business journals in 2011 containing the phrase business analytics in the title or abstract, equal to the total published in such journals in the ten years prior (252 articles in total between 2000 and 2011)"
"Similarly, research from various practitioner sources forecasts growing importance of utilising new sources of data and substantial growth in demand for staff with analytical skills (eg Manyika_et_al.,_2011_CITE)."
"Until the end of 2013 only one paper had been published in this journal, which was primarily focused on a very specific application of financial modelling ( Gosh_&_Troutt,_2012_CITE)"
"Compared to the 252 found by Chen_et_al._(2012)_CITE across all business journals, in the OR/MS literature only 13 were found across the same time period (the years up to and including 2011)"
Secondly there is the potential that academics in the OR/MS community would publish analytics-orientated research in journals not directly associated with OR/MS (eg Coghlan_et_al._(2010)_CITE)
"The claim that analytics is a subset of business intelligence (BI) is a view supported by others such as Bartlett_(2013,_p._4)_CITE who argues Business Intelligence = Business Analytics + Information Technology"
"However, this is contradicted in other research: Vesset,_McDonough,_Morris,_and_Woodward_(2009)_and_SAP_(2012)_CITE state the opposite view, describing BI as the subset of analytics"
"The work of Chen_et_al._(2012),_Chiang,_Goes,_and_Stohr_(2012)_and_Lim,_Chen,_and_Chen_(2012)_CITE sidesteps this by considering the two as a composite, using the acronym BI&#38;A"
"A more cynical perspective is that the distinction is essentially superfluous, and that discussion of analytics is effectively an attempt to reinvigorate interest in the existing field of BI ( Eckerson,_2011;_Elliot,_2011_CITE)."
"For example, Laursen_and_Thorlund_(2010,_p._XII)_CITE define analytics as delivering the right decision support to the right people at the right time"
This definition is very similar to that given by Shim_et_al._(2002)_CITE to the field of decision support systems (DSS): technology solutions that can be used to support complex decision making
"Another example is INFORMS definitions of analytics as the scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better decisions ( Liberatore_&_Luo,_2011,_p._582_CITE); which bears close relation to their definition of OR/MS as the application of advanced analytical methods to make better decisions ( INFORMS,_2013_CITE)"
"Chiang_et_al._(2012,_pp._3 4)_CITE suggest the key areas are data management, database systems, data warehousing, data mining, natural language processing, [ ] network analysis/social networking, optimization, and statistical analysis and that practitioners are able to understand business needs, interpret the analyses performed on big data and provide leadership for data-informed decision making"
"Varshney_and_Mojsilovic_(2011,_p._84)_CITE, however, propose applied mathematics, applied probability, applied statistics, computer science, and signal processing whereas Evans_(2012)_CITE argues for BI/information systems, statistics and OR/MS."
"In the course of the research four papers were found that directly list the disciplines perceived to comprise analytics ( Chiang_et_al.,_2012;_Evans,_2012;_Silvi,_Moeller,_&_Schlaefke,_2010;_Varshney_&_Mojsilovic,_2011_CITE); of which only Evans_(2012)_CITE directly cites OR/MS (although Chiang_et_al._(2012)_CITE list optimization as a key component)."
"This movement, using the concepts introduced by Kuhn_(1962)_CITE, can therefore be described as the dominant paradigm in the science of business management."
"Whilst the movement momentum eventually waned, it had significant impact at the time, as well as leaving a clear legacy on management practice ( Taksa,_1992_CITE)"
"Not only is there the notion of inconsummerability with the practices of proceeding periods, but also that there has been the progression of normal science in the years since ( Kuhn,_1962_CITE)."
This is supported by the work of Locke_(1989)_CITE into what he regards as the start of a new academic paradigm at a similar time
"He argues this brought a new approach of management training through education, opposing the tradition of coming up the ranks from apprentice to master-craftsmen , a practice he argues as being without applied science ( Locke,_1989,_p._4_CITE)"
"The advances and applications of the paradigm have sought to make available data, tools and analyses to provide the evidence to allow decision makers access to discursive evidence that can supplement their use of intuition and experience for more effective decision making (see Shah,_Horne,_&_Capell _(2012)_CITE for further discussion on this area)."
"This is particularly evident in soft OR ( Rosenhead_&_Mingers,_2001_CITE) and behavioural OR ( H m ll inen,_Luoma,_&_Saarinen,_2013_CITE), but also, in approaches such as multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), the use of more subjective expert or decision maker judgement as a data input (see K ksalan,_Wallenius,_&_Zionts_(2011)_CITE for further discussion of the development of these methods)"
"Smil_(2005,_p._8)_CITE argues these widespread and truly revolutionary innovations not only changed the course of the innovating societies but were also translated into profound global impacts"
"In the UK the newly elected Labour government, seeking to increase the size of the public sector, engaged Blackett and colleagues to utilise OR/MS in a succession of new industries such as steel and coal mining ( Kirby,_2003;_Ormerod,_1999_CITE)"
"Although mostly regarded in the UK as a smorgasbord of techniques from a variety of approaches, in the US a formulisation of the methodologies occurred and by the 1960s many of OR/MS principal techniques were established ( Kirby,_2003_CITE)."
"The second period also saw an explosion of innovation in computing, what Ceruzzi_(1999,_p._13)_CITE describes as the advent of commercial computing"
"The list of innovations in the period include the von Neumann architecture (the division of processing and storage memory), the conceptualisation of FORTRAN and COBAL (the first higher-level programming languages), core memory, and the UNIVAC computer ( Aspray,_1990;_Pugh,_1984_CITE)"
"Indeed there are many parallels with the reporting of Nate Silver successfully predicting the 2012 election, and the positive attention it has brought to analytics (eg Thaler,_2012_CITE)."
"For example, only 19 UNIVAC computers, the most famous of the period, were sold between 1951 and 1954, in what was effectively the machine heyday ( Ceruzzi,_1999_CITE)"
"In particular IBM System/360, so named due to its targeting of the full circle of customers, from business to science Ceruzzi_(1999,_p._144)_CITE"
"Alongside mainframe computers, the period saw the introduction of mini-computers where new efficiencies in storage and logic, combined with a low retail price, generated significant sales across many industries ( Ceruzzi,_1999_CITE)"
"One specific example is the development of the RASCEL computer, designed to implement stochastic methods which until this point were too time and resource consuming for practical application in business ( Esch,_1969_CITE)"
"Indeed many of the OR/MS practices such as simulation were particularly boosted by the advent of the computer programs and increased processing power of the age ( Ormerod,_1999_CITE)."
"Expert systems sought to guide the user to a suggested action, dependent on the specific circumstances of the situation, whilst DSS provided more general decision support, displaying the relevant data or model results to do this ( Nelson_Ford,_1985_CITE)"
"The period also saw the emergence of human computer interaction (HCI) as both a term and a specific area of academic research, emphasising the overlap of technology and decision making in the paradigm (eg Card,_Moran,_&_Newell,_1983_CITE)."
"Echoing the earlier discussion about distinctions between BI and analytics, controversies occurred as to whether DSS was a subset of MIS ( Davis,_1982_CITE), its evolution, or just another buzzword to justify the next round of visits from the vendors ( Sprague,_1980,_p._1_CITE)"
"Firstly the period saw the emergence of MCDA, and related approaches such as Analytic Hierarchy Process ( Saaty,_1980_CITE), methods that framed problems as a combination of a set of objectively defined alternatives and a set of subjectively defined criteria ( Buchanan,_Henig,_&_Henig,_1998,_p._334_CITE)"
"This led to the development of the soft systems methodology ( Checkland,_1981_CITE) and strategic options development and analysis ( Ackerman_&_Eden,_2010_CITE)"
"However, these methods were more qualitative in their approach, leading to some degree of polarisation in the OR/MS community as to whether such soft methods were appropriate to the discipline; what Dando_and_Bennett_(1981,_p._91)_CITE would describe as a Kuhnian crisis ."
"However, by 1985, 29 percent had installed the technology ( Basker,_2012_CITE)"
"Whilst these were still essentially GUIs, in contrast with the first DSS, these dashboards were pre-populated with key performance indicators (KPIs) designed to speedily convey the critical measures of business performance ( Few,_2006_CITE)"
"Through a combination of this framework and dashboard technologies, the period created something of a culture of management by metrics whereby KPIs determined everything from staff bonuses to strategic and operational decision making ( Beatham,_Anumba,_Thorpe,_&_Hedges,_2004_CITE)."
"Analytics as a term can be traced back to Aristotle and his work on deductive reasoning ( Malnik,_2012_CITE)"
In this article Kohavi_et_al._(2002)_CITE highlight five particular drivers: verticalization (the creation of bespoke software for more industries); increased accessibility of models to different business users; analysis tools better integrated into information systems; cross-functional usage in different business silos ; and uses in performance management
"Similarly, Davenport_and_Harris_(2007,_p._11)_CITE cite key catalysts as the fact there is far more business data available than ever before and a new generation of technically literate executives the first to grow up with computers ."
"This data is of such scale as to limit the application of BI architecture and relational databases ( Stonebraker_et_al.,_2007_CITE), creating a demand for new technologies and architectures"
"Most notable is perhaps Hadoop, a distributed file system (DFS), designed to store, process and analyse such data, but also includes NoSQL and NewSQL databases ( Cattell,_2010_CITE); the proliferation of cloud computing; and API-streams from data-rich sites such as Facebook and Twitter"
"In short, there has been a completely new ecosystem of businesses, technologies and cottage industries built to tackle the challenges of big data (see Feinleib_(2012)_CITE for a visual representation of this ecosystem)."
"However, the challenges and opportunities presented by working with the extremely large datasets of the period has led to new approaches, which led Anderson_(2008)_CITE to claim that the scientific method is obsolete"
"Undoubtedly analysis of big data may lend itself more to inductive approaches than model building, which invariably seeks to reduce data in the interest of model performance and parsimony ( Pidd,_1999_CITE)"
"The result of such initiatives is to provide fast, accurate and useful information, improving the speed and precision of decision making ( Panian,_2008_CITE)."
"Similar synergies can be seen between the availability of big data, the popularisation of alternative database systems (eg NoSQL), and indeed the quantitative methods that Anderson_(2008)_CITE argues are changing the scientific methodology."
"This conclusion confirms that periodization is not only the product of theory, but it is also a producer of theory ( Green,_1995_CITE)"
"They want a quarter-inch hole ( Christensen,_Cook,_&_Hall,_2005,_p._74_CITE)."
"Traditionally in such models simplicity has been advocated (eg Ward,_1989_CITE), which is not necessarily concordant with using the vast, varied and complex datasets becoming available in the analytics period"
"However, some practitioner examples are emerging of the use of optimisation techniques in big data (eg FICO,_2013_CITE)"
"Whilst examples of data mining and machine learning algorithms applied within distributed systems are numerous (eg Zaki_&_Ho,_2000_CITE), no academic literature on the application of OR/MS methods within these new architectures was found"
"Data visualisation has become one of the main buzzwords of the analytics age, but, as the valuation of Tableau (one of the main software vendors) at $2billion dollars just two days after its initial public offering on the stock market ( Cook,_2013_CITE) indicates, there has been more to this than just hype"
"Visualisation is again not necessarily new to the period ( Friendly,_2005_CITE), but is becoming an area of significant growth partly due to the ability to display visuals on interactive internet browsers, allowing increased distribution and increased power"
"A recent review of operational research and education ( Johnes,_2014_CITE) suggested that despite the large provision of online courses, the OR in education literature, particularly vocational and e-learning education, still presents some gaps"
"He concluded that whilst some issues and problems such as efficiency, scheduling and resourcing in education have been well-covered using a variety of tools and techniques, this is an area in which operational researchers could make useful contributions ( Johnes,_2014_CITE, p_691)"
"The term educational development is used here to mean the systematic and scholarly support for improving both educational process and practices and capabilities of educators ( Stefani,_2003_CITE, p_10)"
"The expectation is that institutions are adaptable and responsive to emerging skills needed by employers and to stakeholders needs in the ways in which educational provision is met ( UKCES,_2014_CITE)"
"At the time of writing this paper the regulatory framework and process for oversight is in a period of significant change ( Business,_Innovation,_&_Skills_Committee,_2016_CITE; DBIS,_2016_CITE)."
"Historically, there have been arguments that too much emphasis has been placed on driving improvement in UK HE through quality assurance (QA) activity at the expense of quality enhancement (QE) ( Harvey,_2005_CITE; Harvey_&_Williams,_2010a,_b_CITE)"
"This is framed by a student as customer perspective, with universities considered as businesses competing in a market ( Houston,_2007,_2008a_CITE)"
"This is a view being reinforced by current changes in the sector ( DBIS,_2016_CITE)"
"These standardised surveys are often unpopular with staff ( Bamber_&_Anderson,_2012_CITE), and student responses low ( Nair,_Adams,_&_Mertova,_2008_CITE)"
"Whilst the purpose of these surveys is also purported to be to inform decisions about improving the student experience and student learning ( Harvey,_2003_CITE), they focus on a narrow range of generic aspects of their experience, such as assessment and feedback and student support, and there is limited qualitative data to help in the interpretation of the reasons for students responses"
"It is therefore argued that this data is inappropriate for helping educators understand how their efforts support student learning in a specific context ( Harvey,_2002_CITE; Houston,_2008a_CITE)"
"In particular, this approach is questioned for its value in providing information usable at local level given the variability in local context ( Ashby,_Richardson,_&_Woodley,_2011_CITE; Harvey,_2003_CITE; Williams_&_Cappuccini-Ansfield,_2007_CITE) and between subject disciplines ( Gibbs,_2010_CITE)."
"In the recent context of external quality review of UK HE institutions, academic quality is described as how well the learning opportunities made available to students enable them to achieve their award ( QAA,_2012_CITE)"
"The focus is on the transparency of policies and procedures, and the effectiveness of institutions own approaches to monitoring, evaluation and improvement ( QAA,_2015_CITE)"
"It has been argued that this, and the accountability to multiple stakeholders, means that quality criteria can be difficult to precisely specify and measure due to the increasing complexity this brings ( Gibbs,_2010_CITE; Houston,_2007,_2008a_CITE)."
"An approach now widely relied on for quality enhancement in HE is for new academic staff to undertake professional development to become reflective practitioners actively engaged in experiential learning ( Kolb,_1984_CITE; Sch n,_1983_CITE) to inform improvement in their practice"
"This has been argued to be too simplistic because it neglects to consider both the wider context of simultaneous change initiatives, and the more complex social and political influences on developing and sharing a concept of good practice ( Trowler,_Fanghanel,_&_Wareham,_2005_CITE)"
"A more systematised and formalised approach to the inquiry through educational action research has been recommended for building capacity, improving rigour and developing transferable knowledge ( Kember,_2002_CITE; Marks-Maran,_2015_CITE)"
"Others have suggested that for organisational change to occur, this process needs to be undertaken and organised at the collective level ( Biggs,_2001_CITE; Vince,_2002_CITE)"
"Whilst some progress has been made with this aspiration ( Bruce,_Flynn,_&_Stagg-Peterson,_2011_CITE), collaborative research has also been found to be challenging in this context, particularly around issues such as establishing amongst collaborators a shared vocabulary, goal ( Jacobs,_2016_CITE) and perception of importance and relevance of the research ( Greenbank,_2007_CITE)."
"The use of technology in learning, teaching and assessment has become an important dimension of UK higher education strategy ( HEFCE,_2009_CITE), and hence educational development work"
"The most recent (at the time of writing) of a periodic survey that monitors trends in this context ( Walker_et_al.,_2014_CITE) reported that enhancing the quality of learning and teaching is the primary longitudinal driver for using technology, but lack of academic staff knowledge was the second most important barrier to developments in this area (after lack of time)"
"It has been argued that this lack of knowledge is due to existing evaluation and research not being based on appropriate assumptions of learning as complex socially constructed activity ( Bennett_&_Oliver,_2011_CITE; Cox_&_Marshall,_2007_CITE; Oliver,_2011_CITE)"
"Whilst the term technology enhanced learning is gaining favour over the term e-learning with its emphasis on added value to the learning process, there continues to be lack of clarity and debate about what exactly is meant by enhancement and how this is evaluated to inform good practice ( Cox_&_Marshall,_2007_CITE; Kirkwood_&_Price,_2014_CITE)"
"Research in this field has been criticised for its focus on specific practical problems such as the use of particular tools in specific contexts, with weak relationship to theory ( Bennett_&_Oliver,_2011_CITE)"
"Their experiences of the usability and accessibility of the technology used ( Kim_&_Lee,_2008_CITE)."
"The generic benefits of using technology (eg time management, revisiting content) ( Henderson_et_al.,_2015_CITE)."
"Strategies for using technology to support learning ( Wan,_Compeau,_&_Haggerty,_2012_CITE)."
"A qualitative study involving interviews with both teachers and students about their experiences of using a new virtual learning environment (VLE) provided some insight into the reasons for perceived benefits and strategies used across the institution as a whole ( Heaton-Shrestha,_May,_&_Burke,_2009_CITE)"
"There is an emerging interest in learning analytics using data held in learning management systems and VLEs to identify patterns of user behaviour and its correlation with demographic and/or assessment data ( Picciano,_2012_CITE; Siemens,_2013_CITE)"
"This can be used to indicate students at risk of dropping out or failure, to inform activity and resource allocation to be directed appropriately towards supporting students and improving retention and progression ( De_Freitas_et_al.,_2015_CITE; Fritz,_2011_CITE; McFadyan_&_Dawson,_2012_CITE; Mogus,_Djurdjeviv,_&_Suvak,_2012_CITE)"
"Again, those conducting this type of research acknowledge its limitation in terms of demonstrating the relationship between specific strategies used and learning ( Verbert,_Duval,_Klerkx,_Govaerts,_&_Santos,_2013_CITE) and providing meaningful data to inform practitioners in improving their own teaching strategies ( Dringus,_2012_CITE)."
"Whilst there has been some discussion and conceptual contributions to HE research about the need for systems approaches in quality processes ( Davis_&_Sumara,_2005_CITE; Houston,_2007,_2008a,_2008b_CITE; Radford,_2006_CITE) and more specifically in the context of TSL ( Ellis_&_Goodyear,_2010_CITE), it has been argued that there is limited evidence to support the utility of these approaches and, that further research is needed ( Houston,_2008a_CITE)."
"To stimulate debate amongst stakeholders about priorities for change at institutional and sector level ( Houston,_Robertson,_&_Prebble,_2008_CITE; Houston_&_Paewal,_2013_CITE)."
"To explore (through survey data) use, experience and perceptions of usefulness of an implemented, institution-wide, e-learning system from both students and teachers perspectives ( Alexander_&_Golja,_2007_CITE)."
"To participatively develop the evaluation criteria to be used in the evaluation of an institution-wide managed learning system ( Hardman_&_Paucar-Caceres,_2011_CITE)."
"Systems thinking underpins the concept of constructive alignment ( Biggs_&_Tang,_2011_CITE), a framework now commonly used to guide practitioners in designing teaching and assessment strategies to help learners achieve specific learning outcomes in context"
"The authors advice to evaluate implemented strategies using evidence readily available that is relevant and sufficient for your purposes ( Biggs_&_Tang,_2011_CITE, p_286) might be helpful in guiding individuals in their reflective practice, but is rather simplistic for the application to more complex, collaborative action research"
"It has also been criticised for treating teleology too simplistically in terms of the relevance of desired learning outcomes to the wider environment ( Lee,_2014_CITE)"
"A more recently proposed systems framework for evaluating computer-supported collaborative learning ( Barros-Castro,_C rdoba-Pach n,_&_Pinz n-Salcedo,_2014_CITE) also took as a starting point the definition of learning purposes from the teachers perspective, neglecting to make explicit the rationale for how these were being shaped through connection with the wider environmental context"
"Hence, terms in common use in early theory and practice were theory-based ( Weiss,_1972_CITE, 1997_CITE) or theory-driven ( Chen,_1990_CITE) evaluation."
"Patton_(2012)_CITE argues that these terms may imply testing of wider social science theory, and that the term program theory is more meaningful in describing the connections stakeholders make about what and how things work in their specific contexts"
"The latter is argued to require both a theory of action (implementation theory) and a theory of change, where the theory of change is considered to be concerned with assumptions about the central process(es) driving change and the theory of action is concerned with the specific strategies used to activate this change in a specific context ( Funnell_&_Rogers,_2011_CITE)"
"For example, in learning processes the theory of change might be informed by pedagogical theory such as experiential learning theory ( Kolb,_1984_CITE)"
"A program theory may be informed by wider social science theory and its testing may contribute to this theory ( Patton,_2012_CITE)."
"Acknowledging the variations in terms and their meaning and usage, this type of evaluation has been described broadly as any evaluation strategy or approach that explicitly integrates and uses stakeholder, social science, some combination of, or other types of theories in conceptualising, designing, conducting, interpreting, and applying an evaluation ( Coryn,_Noakes,_Westine,_&_Scr ter,_2011_CITE: 201) ."
"From a realist perspective (eg Pawson,_2006_CITE; Pawson_&_Tilley,_1997_CITE) the aim of evaluation is to discover context, mechanism and outcome configurations that work in interventions through iterative implementation and evidence-based evaluation"
"There is recognition of the need to understand complexity in terms of multiple factors in causation, non-linearity of change, and emergent outcomes (both intended and unintended) ( Westhorp,_2012,_2013_CITE)"
"As a consequence, there is an emerging preference for the term contribution rather than attribution when discussing relationships between processes and their outcomes, and contribution analysis which aims to make credible causal claims about the contribution an intervention is making to observed results ( Mayne,_2012_CITE, p_270)"
"In this context, the theory of change is considered as a postulated causal package ( Mayne,_2012_CITE)."
"How interventions work may be hidden as the activity of those involved is influenced by their subjective beliefs, values, motivations, interpretations ( Astbury_&_Leeuw,_2010_CITE; Weiss,_1997_CITE)"
"This is to acknowledge that these differences affect not only the outcome(s) of the activity or intervention being evaluated, but also its evaluation ( Connell_&_Kubisch,_1998_CITE; Guba_&_Lincoln,_1989_CITE)"
"It is also acknowledged that using a facilitated mode in OR interventions does place constraints on the approach used (eg methods, models) and that further research is needed about the issues to inform the development of OR methodologies ( Franco_&_Montibeller,_2010_CITE)."
"In both PPE and U-FE the theory of change is not truth about reality but a model that must be useful for those that have created it and comprehensive and engaging for others who will use it ( Funnell_&_Rogers,_2011_CITE, p_241), acting as an agile heuristic ( Funnell_&_Rogers,_2011_CITE, p_79) in guiding action in the direction of improvement"
"A good model has been described as one that contains sufficient knowledge and information to help the client group find a way forward ( Franco_&_Montibeller,_2010_CITE, p_494)"
"It is modelling and model use that is argued to be what distinguishes facilitated modelling from other change facilitation processes and characterises it as OR practice ( Franco_&_Montibeller,_2010_CITE)"
"There is no prescribed format for this model, but users need to be critically reflective about the choice as it can [] affect the way we think about a program theory and can shape it ( Funnell_&_Rogers,_2011_CITE, p_32)"
"Participative and facilitated approaches have also attracted some criticism ( Mason_&_Barnes,_2007_CITE; Pawson_&_Tilley,_1997_CITE; Ulrich,_1987_CITE) for their assumption that all perspectives should be swept in , whether it is appropriate to involve all stakeholders, or even possible to identify all stakeholders, without first determining the scope of the evaluation or privileging someone's perspective on stakeholders"
"It has also been argued that they emphasise initial modelling over testing and critique of how the intervention works in practice ( Blamey_&_Mackenzie,_2007_CITE)"
"In situations of complexity and uncertainty, it also may not be possible to agree thresholds or targets for key indicators of success, as there will be no prior experience or base level data to inform this judgement ( Patton,_2012_CITE)"
"Hence, a systematic literature review of theory of change approaches to evaluation spanning 20 years concluded that more published cases of these type of evaluations are needed explaining how the approach is enacted, procedures and analytic frameworks, and the subsequent use of evaluation results ( Coryn_et_al.,_2011_CITE, p_216)."
"It has been acknowledged for some time now that the theoretical fields of evaluation and systems have largely been developing separately despite sharing many experiences, concepts, goals, even attitudes ( Imam,_LaGoy,_&_Williams,_2007_CITE, p_3) and drawing on some of the same philosophical, sociological, and scientific developments ( Hummelbrunner,_2011_CITE, p_399)."
"Three important concepts that have been argued to be important in categorising inquiry as systemic ( Hummelbrunner,_2011_CITE; Imam_et_al.,_2007_CITE): (a)Perspectives: the assumption that a situation of interest can be viewed from different perspectives.(b)Boundaries: the assumption that these perspectives will reflect value judgements about what/who to include in the scope of interest.(c)Entangled systems: the assumption that these perspectives will reflect value judgements about how boundaries are nested and connected."
"It has been argued that systemic is often interpreted as consideration of every component of that situation plus its context, plus its environment but sometimes is useful to think that a systems-based approach to evaluation it is concerned with what can reasonably left out of the enquiry ( Imam_et_al.,_2007_CITE, p_8)"
"It involves consideration of issues such as the purpose, decision makers, actors, activities, measures of performance, and context for both the situation of interest and its evaluation, and consideration that these judgements are made from a particular viewpoint ( Churchman,_1971_CITE; Midgley,_2000_CITE, 2007_CITE)."
"Both purposeful program evaluation (PPE) ( Funnell_&_Rogers,_2011_CITE) and utilisation-focused evaluation (U-FE) ( Patton,_1986_CITE, 2012_CITE) consider the purposeful nature of evaluation, starting from the assumption that evaluation is informing decisions and actions of its primary users"
"This does not mean other stakeholders perspectives are not important in informing this theory, but considering who these stakeholders are and their role in the evaluation is a decision made in the initial boundary setting process about appropriate design of the evaluation to answer its questions and achieve its purpose for its primary users ( Patton,_1986_CITE, 2012_CITE)"
"These authors also encourage the use of systems thinking in situations of complexity, to guide questions about how things are connected rather than does a cause b ( Patton,_2012_CITE, p_250), and to guide exploration of different perspectives in socially constructing these connections."
"In program evaluation the importance of modelling is emphasised in clarifying program boundaries and helping participants visualise where the program sits in, interacts with, influences, and is influenced by the wider context ( Funnell_&_Rogers,_2011_CITE, p_150)"
"In the soft OR and problem structuring methods literature some authors have found that it can be a challenge to engage and develop practitioners in appropriate methods to use in managing complex situations ( Ackermann,_2011_CITE; Midgley,_2007_CITE)."
"In the educational development literature, there has been some interest in using biological and ecological systems metaphors to explore the dynamic and dialectic complexity of change and adaptation processes in education ( Ellis_&_Goodyear,_2010_CITE; Radford,_2006_CITE)"
"This reflects a perspective that technology enables [change] to happen but it also affects people's expectation about what is normal and possible ( Ellis_&_Goodyear,_2010_CITE, p_2)"
"These examples discuss and illustrate the usefulness of the model in organising thinking about human activity in terms of the roles and relationships and the communication channels between them and how these are working in an organised way to manage change ( Espinosa_&_Walker,_2013_CITE; Preece_et_al.,_2013_CITE)"
"For example, it has been used to try and understand why educational sector reform programs in Latin America experienced disappointing results and to inform a new approach to change ( Espinosa_&_Jackson,_2002_CITE)"
"It has also been found useful in the conceptualisation of a HE curriculum development process to ensure continued relevance of courses in their wider environment ( Gregory_&_Miller,_2014_CITE)"
"In the more specific context of TSL, the VSM has been used as a framework to critique the functionality of prototype e-learning environments and software for their abilities to support the social interactions assumed to be required for social learning processes ( Britain_&_Liber,_2004_CITE)"
"The wider theory underpinning this initiative was experiential learning theory ( Kolb,_1984_CITE; Sch n,_1983_CITE)"
"The institutional requirement for evaluation was framed by a wider context of quality enhancement at institutional and sector level, and historically the institution had experienced some difficulties in engaging stakeholders in evaluation and generating findings usable by multiple stakeholders ( Hart,_Diercks-O'Brien,_&_Powell,_2009_CITE)."
"A further purpose of the evaluation was therefore developmental ( Patton,_1994_CITE), in terms of helping organisational members learn how to learn ( Argyris_&_Sch n,_1996_CITE)"
"The model format chosen to engage the teaching team in planning the evaluation was similar to what has been called a tabulated pipeline model ( Funnell_&_Rogers,_2011_CITE)"
"It is not uncommon practice in program evaluation to make initial drafts from existing documentation ( Funnell_&_Rogers,_2011_CITE)"
"Attempt was made to address some of the criticisms of traditional linear models by including elements to describe its coupling with its wider environment ( Hummelbrunner,_2011_CITE; Julian,_Jones,_&_Deyo,_1995_CITE)"
"This was in terms of the outcomes and factors outside the team's direct control that might be influence direction and success ( Funnell_&_Rogers,_2011_CITE)"
"As a model we are reminded that the VSM is neither true nor false: it is more or less useful ( Beer,_1985_CITE, p_2) offering a [...] set of abstractions as a working tool ( Beer,_1985_CITE, p_xi)"
"For this, readers can refer to one of Beer's original sources ( Beer,_1985_CITE for accessible explanation), or other efforts at summarising and simplifying the model (eg Espejo_&_Gill,_1997_CITE; Preece_et_al.,_2013_CITE)"
"This viability has been interpreted as being dependent on a process of experiential learning in context ( Badinelli_et_al.,_2012_CITE), where the VSM provides a model for the information flow required for learning and adaptation of an organisation in its wider environment."
"When using the VSM, Beer_(1985)_CITE recommends modelling the viable system in focus and the viable organisations at least one level higher and lower, ie considering the relationship with the immediate wider environment that it produces and the core component operations that produce it"
"The term variety is described as a measure of complexity because it counts the number of possible states of a system ( Beer,_1985_CITE, p_21)"
Beer_(1985)_CITE stresses the importance of understanding the difference between these as both are required for what he describes as homeostatic regulation
"The concept of homeostasis in the context of social relationships has been described as referring to relationships that keep stable over a time period while agreeing on certain purposes and game rules that fit both (Espinosa in Espinosa_&_Jackson,_2002_CITE, p_1334)"
"It is also a model to guide critique of how these relationships are designed for balance such that no entity will be swamped [ ] by the proliferation of another's variety ( Beer,_1985_CITE, p_29)."
"They provide them with a sense of provisional stability to help make decisions about change needed to move from one state to another ( Saunders,_Charlier,_&_Bonamy,_2005_CITE)"
"The approach taken in this case study was to acknowledge this and focus on the primary users of the evaluation as advocated by U-FE ( Patton,_1986_CITE, 2012_CITE)"
"A further benefit for guiding evaluation is that this model can be translated into generic evaluation questions of interest to each function that can be more easily understood by those not familiar with the model ( Fitch,_2007_CITE)"
"The focus of first order inquiry is the situation of interest, with the focus of the second order inquiry being the first order inquiry ( Midgley,_2000_CITE)"
"Whilst some research on academic staff opinions of the evaluation of learning and teaching has indicated an openness to regular and structured processes of evaluation and a more creative approach , this was with the caveat that this should not involve significant time and effort ( Bamber_&_Anderson,_2012_CITE, p_11)"
"Other research has suggested that the triad of partners (team leads, teacher researchers and university researchers) ( Bruce_et_al.,_2011_CITE, p_450) enables some of these challenges to be overcome because this workload could be shared, with the role of the team lead has also been highlighted as crucial in communicating between other team members and the researchers ( Bruce_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"The emerging technology of Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) ( Akyildiz,_Wang,_&_Wang,_2005_CITE) provides a promising paradigm for the flexible and low-cost provision of global Internet communication"
"Packet scheduling facilitates improved throughput, fairness between clients, reduced delays and energy conservation ( Quintas_&_Friderikos,_2012_CITE)"
Kim_and_Glass_(2014)_CITE derive a simple test for the existence of a feasible schedule for problems with two or three distinct periodicities in total
"Bar-Noy,_Dreizin,_and_Patt-Shamir_(2004)_CITE consider two objective measures of maximum and weighted average ratios between the allocated and requested periodicities"
"Bar-Noy,_Nisgav,_and_Patt-Shamir_(2002b)_CITE develop tree based approximation algorithms for perfect periodic schedule with the objective of minimizing weighted average ratios between the allocated periodicity and requested periodicity"
"Brakerski,_Dreizin,_and_Patt-Shamir_(2003)_CITE study the question of dispatching in a perfect periodic schedule, namely how to find the next item to schedule, given the past schedule"
"There are few other papers which consider PPS for telecommunications, namely ( Brakerski_et al.,_2003;_Brakerski,_Nisgav,_&_Patt-Shamir,_2006;_Chen_&_Huang,_2008;_Patil_&_Garg,_2006_CITE), but none applied to WMNs."
"One article ( Allen,_Cooper,_Glass,_Kim,_&_Whitaker,_2012_CITE) explores the means of coordinating local mesh schedules which are periodic, but not necessarily so restrictive as to be perfectly periodic"
Allen_et al._(2012)_CITE develop an optimization scheduling algorithm which in addition equitably reduces the service time to local clients
"When a routing tree has multiple Mesh nodes adjacent to the Gateway, the PPS problem is NP-hard ( Kim_&_Glass,_2014_CITE)"
"While factorisation is NP-hard in general, it can be performed quickly for any integer up to 40 digits long ( Wolfram,_2008_CITE)"
"In doing so the research complements work on perfect periodic schedules at a single mesh node by Kim_and_Glass_(2014)_CITE, and on transmit schedules across the access network to the Internet Gateway respecting pre-generated periodic local mesh schedules ( Allen_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
Information fusion is a specific aggregation process which aims to extract truthful knowledge from incomplete or uncertain information coming from various sources [15]_CITE
"This topic is relevant in many areas: expert opinion fusion in risk analysis [24]_CITE, image fusion in computer vision [13,14]_CITE, sensor fusion in robotics [1,61,86]_CITE, database merging [18,21]_CITE, target recognition [78]_CITE, logic [67,68]_CITE and so forth"
It lies at the origin of probability theory whose pioneers in the XVIIth century were concerned by merging unreliable testimonies at courts of law [98]_CITE
"There are many approaches and formats to model information, and several uncertainty theories [51]_CITE"
"The fusion problem in the presence of uncertain or incomplete information has been discussed in each of these settings almost independently of the other ones [49,80,83,101]_CITE"
"Sometimes, dedicated principles have been stated in order to characterise the specific features of the fusion process in the language of each particular formal setting [69,73,87,109]_CITE"
"This happens in the problem of merging preferences from several individuals modelled by complete preorderings (Arrow impossibility theorem, see the discussion in [22]_CITE)"
"The case of merging propositional belief bases, for which a set of postulates, due to Konieczny and Pino-Perez [68]_CITE, exists, is then discussed"
We also analyse postulates for merging imprecise probabilities proposed by Peter Walley [109]_CITE in the light of our general approach.
"For example Ti can be a set, a probability or a possibility distribution [42]_CITE, or an ordinal conditional function [104]_CITE or a knowledge base."
"In this paper, we do not discuss the fusion of precise set-valued entities, such as multisets [17]_CITE, where sets represent complex entities made of the conjunction of several, possibly identical elements, representing hierarchical data structures [19]_CITE, or related tuples in relational databases"
Such multiset fusion problems can be found when cleaning databases containing duplicate data [18]_CITE or for the summarisation of documents
"The concept of plausibility ordering corresponds to the idea of potential surprise already discussed by Shackle [96]_CITE, namely a state of affairs is all the more implausible as its presence is more surprising"
Note that T can take the form of a propositional knowledge base K [68]_CITE; then W is the set of interpretations of a propositional language L
"A possibility distribution [50]_CITE, namely a mapping T: W L where L is a totally ordered set of plausibility levels, its bottom 0 encoding impossibility, and its top 1 encoding full plausibility"
"In contrast, we can let L=[0,1] and use numerical degrees of possibility (often interpreted as upper probability bounds [50]_CITE)"
"Alternatively, (im)possibility levels can be encoded by integers, as done by Spohn [104]_CITE"
"However, in that case the scale is one of implausibility, namely a mapping T:W N such as T(w)=0 for normal situations, and w is all the less plausible as T( w) is greater (then one may let T(w)=k T(w) for some integer k > 1 [50]_CITE)"
A mass assignment mT that defines belief and plausibility functions in Shafer theory of evidence [97]_CITE
A convex set of probability measures [109]_CITE: it may represent either a set of possible probabilistic information items (it is a second order 0 1 possibility distribution) or the state of belief of an agent described via desirable gambles (see Section 8.1 for details)
"In the merging of expert opinions, experts provide knowledge about parameters of components of a complex system (for instance, failure rate of a pump in a nuclear power plant), in the form of an uncertainty distribution that can be a subjective probability distribution [24]_CITE, or yet a likelihood function [57]_CITE, or a possibility distribution [94]_CITE."
The problem of syntax-independent merging of logical databases [69]_CITE comes down to merging their sets of models.
"In sensor fusion, information provided is often modelled by random sets that account for reliability coefficients [61,86]_CITE"
"Namely, sensor readings can be mapped to a set of decision hypotheses modelled by mass functions [97]_CITE."
"Following the terminology in [5]_CITE, a fusion operator is a collection of fusion operations fn, n N, n 1 for all arities"
"A fusion operation with such an agenda was called arbitration by Revesz [93]_CITE and taken over by Liberatore and Schaerf [73]_CITE, in the set-theoretic or logical framework"
"The basic properties proposed here in generality have counterparts in properties considered in some particular settings; see especially [109]_CITE for imprecise probability, [87]_CITE for possibility theory and [68]_CITE for knowledge bases"
Idempotence could be adopted if it is not known whether the sources are independent or not [49]_CITE
"Local Ordinal Unanimity is a special case of the so-called Arbitration property used in knowledge base merging [69]_CITE 5 5This name is borrowed from [93], and [73], but the Arbitration property here seems to be only loosely related to the notion of arbitration operation in the sense of [73]., a variant of which can be written here in the case of n sources: Arbitration if i=1, ,n,w Tiwi, and i,j=1, ,n,wi f(T1, ,Tn)wj, then i=1, ,n,w f(T1, ,Tn)wi."
"For instance, re-normalisation of belief functions or possibility distributions obtained by fusion is not always compulsory [99]_CITE, even if sub-normalisation expresses a form of inconsistency"
"Likewise, in the symbolic setting, where knowledge is expressed by means of logical formulas, one may relax this assumption by adopting a paraconsistent approach whereby each formula is either supported, denied, unknown or conflicting with respect to a set of sources (as for instance in the approach by Belnap [6]_CITE)."
"This postulate is implicitly at work in belief revision [56]_CITE as well, since in the AGM axioms 6 6named from Alchourr n, G rdenfors and Makinson [2]"
"it is assumed that when the new information does not contradict the prior one, the revision comes down to an expansion [2]_CITE, which is, in our sense, an optimistic fusion operation [32]_CITE."
"It sounds natural for two sources only, but may be found overcautious in the case of many sources [45]_CITE"
"But it arguably addresses other tasks than the one considered here (like estimation, where independence assumptions are needed, and precise observations are available, or the explicit discounting of sources [97]_CITE, which is a form of contraction [2]_CITE)."
"This process is fundamentally asymmetric: generally, priority is given to the input information and the process is driven by the minimal change principle [2,32]_CITE (the prior information is minimally changed so as to accept the input information)"
"However, a natural way of handling an unreliable information item is to use the discounting method [97]_CITE in order to get a reliable but less informative information item"
This topic is discussed in [26]_CITE for logical databases
"For instance, merging probability measures into another one requires a weighted average [81]_CITE, which rules out conjunctive and disjunctive modes of fusion (that yield belief functions) [45]_CITE"
"In numerical settings, conjunctive rules like Dempster rule of combination for belief functions are even discontinuous in the presence of severely (but not fully) conflicting information [45]_CITE."
"In the case of preference aggregation, the items of information reflect how the world should be, according to sources that can represent individuals (in voting theory) or criteria (in multifactorial evaluation) [107]_CITE"
"For instance, the famous Arrow axioms of voting apply to the fusion of total orderings and some of them are similar to some of our information fusion postulates [22]_CITE"
"In order to characterise a canonical fusion rule, though, only three axioms among the eight ones are needed to ensure uniqueness in the case of two sources [32]_CITE: Optimism: If E 2 E 1 , then both f ( E 1 , E 2 ) E 1 and f ( E 1 , E 2 ) E 2 hold"
This framework leaves room for just one such aggregation (first advocated in [43]_CITE).
"This way of tackling inconsistency is similar to variable forgetting in logical knowledge bases [70]_CITE (if W contains two elements only, E 1 E 2 is vacuous)."
"In that respect, the set representation is too rigid, and it pleads for a more flexible representation setting where inconsistency can be a matter of degree (some approaches get rid of inconsistency in fusion problems by a similarity-based enlargement of the sets of interpretations of information items [95]_CITE)."
"It satisfies the following property [68]_CITE: Majority-Insensitivity: if E1=E2= =En=E, then fn+1(E0,E1, ,En)=f2(E0,E), n>1."
It is interesting to compare the set-based instantiations of our general postulates to the axioms of arbitration after Liberatore and Schaerf [73]_CITE
"A closure assumption: f( E 1, E 2) is a set (implicit in [73]_CITE)."
"In the set-theoretic representation, these postulates are not independent, as shown in [73]_CITE; for instance Impossibility Preservation and Fairness are consequence of the other six ones"
"An operator is a mapping from knowledge profiles to knowledge bases, and is a KP-merging operator (after Koniecny and Pino-P rez [68]_CITE) if and only if it satisfies the following postulates [68]_CITE"
Indeed Konieczny and Pino-Perez [68]_CITE indicate that the Majority-Insensitivity property is incompatible with their axiomatic setting A1 A6 (and they propose a weak version of it).
"In [67]_CITE the same authors use both hard (integrity) constraints and belief sets referring to plausible worlds, and try to extend both the AGM revision and knowledge-based merging"
In the purely ordinal case comparative possibility was introduced by Lewis [72]_CITE and independently by Dubois [31]_CITE
"From the late 1980 onward, ordinal plausibility orderings are found in the theory of belief revision after Grove [58]_CITE, G rdenfors [56]_CITE, Katsuno and Mendelzon [63]_CITE"
"Here are two of them [9]_CITE: Refinement ordering: 1 2 if and only if P 1 refines P 2 ; Specificity ordering [50,88] , letting k and be the number of elements of the partitions induced by 1 and 2 respectively: 1 2 if and only if i = 1 , , min ( k , ) , j = 1 i A j 1 j = 1 i A j 2"
"Specificity ordering [50,88]_CITE, letting k and be the number of elements of the partitions induced by 1 and 2 respectively:"
"The specificity ordering (put forward by Pearl [88]_CITE as favouring the most compact ranking) is weaker than refinement but it introduces a systematic commensurateness assumption between the weak order relations, whereby Aj1 is mapped to Aj2, for j=1, ,min(k, ), namely it presupposes that in each pair (Aj1,Aj2) the sets are equally likely"
"Nevertheless the specificity ordering is used in ordinal approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning like Pearl system Z [88]_CITE, or the semantic account of preferential inference in terms of linear possibility distributions [9]_CITE, as it fits the natural informational ordering of possibility theory [50]_CITE."
"Of course, together with non-dictatorship they lead to the celebrated Arrow impossibility theorem from voting theory [3]_CITE, saying that dictatorship is then the only possible fusion rule, namely the result of merging several complete preorders is necessarily one of them"
Lehmann and Maynard-Reid [79]_CITE try to bypass the impossibility result by relaxing the complete preordering representation
"Lehmann and Maynard-Reid [79]_CITE suggest to compute the union of the strict parts of i: in terms of combining subsets of W W, the strict part MR of the result reads RMR = i=1n(Ri (Ri 1)c),where (w1,w2) Ri 1 if and only if w 2 i w 1, and Ri (Ri 1)c represents the strict part of i."
"The likely dominance rule [33]_CITE: w 1 LD w 2 [ w 1 > w 2] > [ w 2 > w 1]; w1 LDw2 [w1 w2]= [w2 w1], where [w1>w2]={i:w1 iw2}, and is a partial preordering on subsets I, J of sources, representing their relative reliability."
Lehmann and Maynard-Reid [79]_CITE propose their fusion rule for merging epistemic states represented by transitive and modular relations
"The likely dominance rule is the one that remains in decision under non-commensurate uncertainty and utility, when the first five Savage axioms of decision theory (see [51]_CITE Chapter 9) are preserved, but for the completeness and transitivity of the preference over acts."
"In the case where the obtained relation is strongly inconsistent, one way to escape the trival result of a strongly inconsistent result is to attach priorities to sources, as done by Maynard-Reid and Shoham [80]_CITE"
"The likely dominance rule does the same by attaching priorities to groups of sources, but the resulting relation may include cycles [33]_CITE"
Possibility theory is one of the main theories for reasoning under uncertainty due to incomplete information [44]_CITE
"Possibility theory has several variants [50]_CITE, some being qualitative (ordinal, as in the previous subsection, or classificatory), some being numerical such as the theory of kappa functions by Spohn [104,106]_CITE"
"Pioneers of possibility theory are the English economist Shackle [96]_CITE who interpreted plausibility in terms of lack of surprise, the philosopher Lewis [72]_CITE, who introduced comparative possibility relations in order to provide a semantics to his logic of counterfactuals, and the professor of electrical engineering Zadeh [118]_CITE, who related degrees of possibility and membership functions of fuzzy sets in the setting of natural language understanding, for the purpose of modelling the extension of gradual predicates"
"More recently, numerical degrees of possibility were understood as upper bounds of probability degrees [48]_CITE"
"Independently, Spohn [104]_CITE introduced an integer-valued theory of plausibility, where higher integers reflect more implausible situations and are viewed as exponents of infinitesimal probabilities [105]_CITE."
"There are four kinds of scales one may envisage in increasing order of expressiveness: qualitative (finite or not), integer-valued, or real-valued [10]_CITE"
This setting is used in possibilistic logic [36]_CITE
This setting is also used in possibilistic logic [36]_CITE.
This is isomorphic to the use of integers in so-called -functions by Spohn [104]_CITE
It is used in belief merging by Chopra et al [22]_CITE.
"In this case, a possibility measure can be viewed as special case of a Shafer [97]_CITE plausibility function, actually a consonant plausibility function, and 1 a potential surprise function in the sense of Shackle [96]_CITE."
"Like sets, uncertain inputs represented by possibility distributions can be combined by means of aggregation operators in two main modes: conjunctive or disjunctive [49]_CITE with the same rationale on the assumed reliability of sources"
"In the DASB settings the most usual conjunctions and disjunctions are respectively continuous triangular norms (t-norms, for short) and co-norms [65]_CITE"
"On the contrary, if the dependence between sources is unknown, the use of idempotent connectives (min and max ) looks appropriate [49]_CITE"
"The scale classification at the beginning of this subsection stands in contrast with the one usual in measurement theory [76]_CITE, distinguishing between ordinal scales (DORD), ratio scales (the positive real line up to a positive multiplicative factor), and interval scales (the real line up to a positive affine transformation)"
"Nevertheless, let us mention Ma and Liu [77]_CITE who use representations of epistemic states as a mapping :W Z, the set of relative integers (including ) that is insensitive to integer translations (for any constant k, and +k represent the same information item)"
"It can be checked that + = + minw W( (w )+ (w )), the combination rule for kappa functions [71]_CITE."
"In fact, it can be useful if the possibility of lying untruthful sources exists [85]_CITE."
"Trying to satisfy this property justifies a renormalised conjunctive operation of the form, w W: *^( 1, , n)(w)=Cns*( 1, , n) *( 1(w)* * n(w))where * =sup{ : * } is the residual operator of * [65]_CITE, which yields 1 if"
"Two instances of this rule, respectively in the QUALFI or DORD settings and in the numerical ones were already proposed in [45]_CITE: (5)min^( 1, , n)(w)={mini=1n i(w)iflessthanCnsmin( 1, , n)1otherwise; (6)prod^( 1, , n)(w)= 1(w) n(w)maxv W 1(v) n(v)"
"Moreover, the rule (5) loses the associativity of the minimum rule, while its variant (6) with product instead of minimum preserves associativity [45]_CITE"
"Note that this combination rule is exactly the one recently proposed by Laverny and Lang [71]_CITE on positive integers: = + minw W( (w )+ (w )),in order to combine ranking functions of Spohn, once the latter is mapped back to the unit interval (DENUM setting) via a suitable transformation"
Ma and Liu [77]_CITE propose postulates to justify this combination rule in terms of addition of relative plausibility functions recalled in Remark 1
Another fusion rule for possibility distributions called MCS-cuts applies the classical MCS rule to all cuts of the input possibility distributions has been recently proposed [30]_CITE
"In [87]_CITE, the following properties were proposed w.r.t a fusion operator applied to a set of possibility distributions i: O1: -Commutativity and -associativity.O2: -Idempotence.O3: -Monotony"
"There are two axioms related to O4, adapted from the probabilistic setting [24]_CITE:"
Quota merging rules can apply to possibility distributions [52]_CITE
Chopra et al [22]_CITE also propose seven postulates for information fusion in the DENUM setting
"Their axiom 0 corresponds to an optimistic form of impossibility preservation (even though no state is considered impossible in [22]_CITE), which would read (w) maxi=1n i(w) in our setting"
"The lack of such considerations and the fact that they compare their setting with the one of Arrow as well and discuss strategy-proofness, suggest their framework is not solely devoted to the search of truth in a body of information items, but like authors of [69]_CITE, they consider information fusion as encompassing both preference and plausibility merging."
Possibility distributions over a set consisting of interpretations of a Boolean language can be encoded as possibilistic knowledge bases [36]_CITE
"In the distance-based merging approach [66]_CITE, given a propositional knowledge base Ki, a distance between interpretations and Ki is defined as d(w,Ki)=minw Kid(w,w ),where d is a distance between interpretations of the language, for instance the Hamming distance counting the number of instantiated variables that differ in w and w"
"As explained in [7]_CITE, it is then easy to reinterpret distance-based propositional knowledge-based merging rules in terms of aggregation operations in possibility theory: The maximum rule proposed in [66,68] corresponds to the normalised minimum rule (5) in possibility theory"
"The maximum rule proposed in [66,68]_CITE corresponds to the normalised minimum rule (5) in possibility theory"
The max rule is one of those proposed by Chopra et al [22]_CITE in the DENUM setting.
"The sum rule proposed in [66,68]_CITE corresponds to the normalised product rule (6) in possibility theory"
Note that a form of this fusion rule was already at work in the old expert system MYCIN (see the corresponding discussion in [45]_CITE)
"The sum rule is also one of those proposed in [22]_CITE and appears as well in [71,77]_CITE."
"The GMax fusion rule proposed in [66,68]_CITE corresponds to the leximin rule [34]_CITE that refines the minimum operation applied to possibility distributions [7]_CITE"
One of the merging rules (called min 1) proposed in [22]_CITE encodes the GMax fusion rule by means of integers.
"Quota rules for merging knowledge bases are found in [54,91]_CITE and can be explained in the setting of possibility theory as well"
"In [75]_CITE, an adaptive algorithm for merging stratified knowledge-bases (SKBs) is proposed"
"In the same vein, Hunter and Liu [59]_CITE, proposed an adaptive algorithm for merging possibility distributions"
"Although information ordering, as defined in this paper was not used in [59]_CITE, the assessment of information quality for ranking information items was indeed applied in order to generate partially maximal consistent subsets."
"This is also true for the approach in [117]_CITE, where the set of possible worlds is ranked, based on the set of stratified knowledge bases, according to a Condorcet-like method after voting systems, prior to reconstructing a stratified base"
"In evidence theory [97,116]_CITE, further developed as the Transferable Belief Model [102]_CITE, a piece of information T is modelled by a basic belief assignment (bba) mT which is a mapping from 2 W to [0, 1] such that E WmT(E)=1, and mT("
"It is well-known [97]_CITE that a bba subsumes probability distributions (when focal sets are only singletons), and possibility distributions (when focal sets are nested)"
"using the contour function [97]_CITE: T(w)= A W,w AmT(A)=Pl({w}); this is a natural option for comparing possible worlds ( w 1 T w 2 if and only if T( w 1) T( w 2))."
directly using a kind of dominance between bba [37]_CITE: w1 Tdomw2 if and only if
"It has been pointed out in [74]_CITE that m 1, 2( ) is not a measure of discrepancy between bba s, since two identical bba may have a non-zero degree of conflict 11 11A distance function such as d(m1,m2)=maxA W(|m1(A) m2(A)|) seems more appropriate for this kind of discrepancy."
"Strongly (or logically [29]_CITE ) mutually consistent if E F, E F :E E"
"The above definition of consistency is equivalent to saying that the two credal sets M(m1) and M(m2) have a non-empty intersection [20]_CITE, which explains the name of this type of consistency"
"Recently, Destercke and Burger [28]_CITE have proposed an axiomatic setting for measures of conflict, that has some connection with our postulates"
"[41]_CITE m 1 pl m 2, if A W, pl 1( A) pl 2( A)."
The next definition requires the notion of a commonality function q induced by a bba mT [97]_CITE: q(A)= Ei AmT(Ei)
"[41]_CITE m 1 q m 2 if A W, q 1( A) q 2( A)."
"Relationships among these orderings are as follows [41]_CITE: s-ordering implies pl-ordering and q-ordering, but the converse is false"
"However, the pl-ordering and the q-ordering are not comparable and can be at odds with one another: it is easy to find bba m 1 and m 2 such that m 1 pl m 2 and m 2 q m 1, in which case the contour functions are equal [29]_CITE, which may baffle the intuition"
"For the sake of simplicity, we only focus on the main combination rules, although many variants have been proposed in the literature (see [101]_CITE for an extensive review)"
"The main difference between Dempster rule and the three other rules respectively proposed in [102]_CITE (see also [100]_CITE) [113]_CITE, and [45]_CITE concern the way the mass (m1 m2)("
"Smets [100]_CITE has advocated a non-normal version (21) of Dempster combination rule, which comes down to a mere intersection of independent random sets"
"The combination rule (23) directly extends the basic fusion rule (3) for two sets, from Section 4.1, and was proposed by Dubois and Prade [45]_CITE"
"However, there may be several minimally specific fusion rules, if we leave the choice of x( E, F) open [29]_CITE."
"Three main points can be stressed [51]_CITE: 1.The uniform probability distribution is ambiguous, it cannot tell fair dice from unknown ones, but for the fact that the uniform distribution representing the former is objective, while the one representing the latter is subjective.2.Probabilistic representations of ignorance are questionably scale or language-dependent: for instance a uniform distribution on a linear scale does not remain uniform after a non-linear monotonic transformation (eg logarithmic)"
"In the presence of ambiguity or incomplete information, people do not make decision in agreement with expected utility based on a unique subjective probability distribution on states of nature, as revealed by Ellsberg paradox [53]_CITE."
"Under the Bayesian approach [57,84]_CITE, the fusion process is in fact a combined revision/fusion process due to the presence of a prior probability"
"As explained quite early by Walley [109]_CITE, the framework of imprecise probability is much more convenient than the one of single subjective probability in order to discuss the problem of merging beliefs, since the latter are inherently imprecise"
"In fact, the representation of belief by imprecise probability is but a slight variation of the standard exchangeable betting behaviour setting [110]_CITE"
"Nowadays, imprecise probabilities have been extensively developed and found applications in many real-world scenarios [4]_CITE."
"This representation is justified by Walley as a rational approach to representing coherent beliefs, after some previous works by Smith [103]_CITE and Williams [112]_CITE, extending De Finetti framework for subjective probabilities [55]_CITE"
"Like in the personalist approaches to probability [55]_CITE, belief is measured by the propensity of an agent to buy or gamble with uncertain outcomes"
It satisfies the following rationality properties [110]_CITE: 1
"In the classical exchangeable bet approach [55]_CITE, the buying and selling prices are the same and E (X)=E (X) is the expectation with respect to a single probability distribution."
"Under the subjectivist interpretation due to Walley [110]_CITE, epistemic states are characterised by a credal set"
Nevertheless there are noticeable set-functions that are special cases of coherent lower or upper probabilities [111]_CITE: 2-monotone (convex) capacities g such that g(A B)+g(A B) g(A)+g(B)
"In an unpublished research note [109]_CITE, Walley gave a detailed account of postulates for information fusion taking the form of credal sets representing agent opinions, emphasising four general requirements a)the aggregated opinion should be coherent;b)if all agents of the group desire a certain gamble, so should reflect the aggregated result;c)an aggregation result should at least partially reflect the opinions of each agent (what Walley calls a reconciliation);d)an aggregation result should reflect any level of indeterminacy shared by all agents."
It always computes the least informative credal set in agreement with available information (maximal credal set compatible with constraints [110]_CITE)
Moral and Sagrado [83]_CITE also consider postulates for merging credal sets partially inspired by Walley s
"Walley [109]_CITE comes up with a number of merging rules that result from the conditions he posed, and that according to the above analysis fit our framework"
"The weighted average rule, promoted by Cooke [24]_CITE, of the form fnav(P1, ,Pn)= i=1n iPi where i=1n i=1"
"Considering the mere arithmetic average so as to stay in agreement with our assumptions, the issue is whether we consider a probability measure P as a singleton { P}, ie as a very special credal set, as Walley [109]_CITE did, or if we see P as just a kind of distribution pointing out some states are more probable than other ones."
"Interestingly, the comparison between entropies of two probability distributions yields an ordering that refines the specificity ordering of possibility distributions that can be obtained by a suitable transformation (called the Lorentz curve) of these probability distributions (see [35]_CITE for results in the finite setting and an overview of this literature)"
"This is even more patent in the case of Bayesian fusion, where input information takes the form of likelihood functions that are well-known to be a kind of possibility distributions [23,39]_CITE"
"The Bayesian fusion actually combines revision (of the prior probability) and fusion (of the likelihood functions); see [52]_CITE for more details and the counterpart to Bayesian fusion in possibility theory, using possibilistic priors."
"The corresponding belief function is defined by BelDP(A)=P1(A) P2(A) since, in general, Bel (A)=Bel1(A) Bel2(A) for the disjunctive rule [42]_CITE"
"Indeed, this debate sheds light on the meaning of credal set fusion as envisaged by Walley [109]_CITE"
"Walley considers [110]_CITE that there is no such thing as an ill-known subjective probability: beliefs in imprecise probability theory are directly modelled by lower previsions and in particular, lower probabilities (this is the so-called direct interpretation of lower prevision [110]_CITE, section 2.10)"
"Then M is an ontic set [25,82]_CITE, a precise mathematical representation of the lower prevision function, which in turn may represent imprecise knowledge of a determinic state w W"
The same holds for the notions of independence in imprecise probability theory that differ if credal sets are imprecise descriptions of probability functions or precise characterisations of lower previsions [110]_CITE.
"It is clear that the analysis may be carried out even more systematically, as well as applied to other settings, whether numerical or ordinal, eg, ranking functions [104]_CITE (that we nevertheless also discuss briefly)."
"3) have been specifically developed to simulate human teachers and tutors behavior and support learners in reaching their study objectives by giving targeted assistance and adaptive feedback customized to their users individual knowledge and performance ( Larkin_&_Chabay,_1992;_Anderson,_Corbett,_Koedinger,_&_Pelletier,_1995;_Bayraktar,_2001;_Shute_&_Towle,_2003;_Woolf,_2010;_Graesser,_Conley,_&_Olney,_2012_CITE)."
"In the interaction with such educational technologies, like in any interaction between human users and technical systems, a multitude of dialogue forms can occur, ranging from simple commands to information retrieval dyads to elaborate conversations ( Allen_et_al.,_2001_CITE)"
"In certain (non-tutorial) applications, even tactile feedback has been proven useful ( Akamatsu,_Mackenzie,_&_Hasbroucq,_1995_CITE)"
"However, due to its closeness to the predominant inter-human dialogue form and based on the ever increasing demand for hands-free and eyes-free interfaces, there is a continuing trend towards speech-based system interfaces, regarding both user input and computer output ( Cohen_&_Oviatt,_1995;_Nass_&_Gong,_2000;_Allen_et_al.,_2001;_Graesser,_VanLehn,_Ros ,_Jordan,_&_Harter,_2001;_Nass_&_Brave,_2005_CITE)."
"While in the last few decades a substantial amount of research has been conducted with regard to the production and processing of syntactic as well as emotional prosody in the interaction between humans (see, eg, Frick,_1985;_Price,_Ostendorf,_Shattuck-Hufnagel,_&_Fong,_1991;_Baum_&_Pell,_1999;_Scherer,_2003;_Friederici_&_Alter,_2004;_Wildgruber,_Ackermann,_Kreifelts,_&_Ethofer,_2006;_Wolff,_Schlesewsky,_Hirotani,_&_Bornkessel-Schlesewsky,_2008_CITE), little effort has been directed towards enlightening the role of prosody in the context of human computer interaction, especially regarding the effects of emotional prosody produced by the computer"
"Cowie_et_al.,_2001;_Schuller,_Rigoll,_&_Lang,_2003;_El_Ayadi,_Kamel,_&_Karray,_2011_CITE) or on the problem of how to simulate prosodic variations in synthesized speech (eg, Murray_&_Arnott,_1993;_Schr der,_2001,_2009;_Burkhardt_&_Stegmann,_2009_CITE), but in how far prosodic variations employed by a technical system might influence a human user attempting to interact with the system remains a largely open question"
"Even though several basic emotions are now prosodically implemented in various speech synthesizing programs (for a continuously updated overview, see Burkhardt,_2014_CITE), thereby rendering an examination of their impact feasible, controlled empirical studies in this regard are still pending."
"In the context of learning, it is opportune to select prosodic variations that are known to have a motivating effect in human learning, since besides other factors like intelligence, task-specific skills, or attention the learner motivation has long been known to have a substantial effect on learning success ( Stipek,_2001;_Pintrich,_2003_CITE), especially in situations where learning is self-regulated ( Zimmerman_&_Schunk,_2012,_chap._1_CITE) and computer-assisted ( Song_&_Keller,_2001_CITE)."
"An individual motivation for a particular behavior is partially based on dispositional sources which are relatively stable and unaffected by external factors, eg, the individual need for achievement ( Murray,_1938;_McClelland,_Atkinson,_&_Clark,_1953;_McClelland,_1985;_Thrash,_Elliot,_&_Schultheiss,_2007_CITE), esteem needs ( Maslow,_1954_CITE), need for competence ( Deci_&_Ryan,_1985,_2002_CITE), causal attributions for success and failure ( Weiner,_1979,_1985,_2005_CITE, chap"
"5), or goal orientation ( Dweck,_1986;_Ames_&_Archer,_1988;_Elliot,_2005,_chap._4_CITE), and partially stems from the intrinsic interest and pleasure in the behavior itself (eg, Csikszentmihalyi,_1975;_Renninger,_2000_CITE)"
"However, the desired behavior can also be extrinsically motivated by the prospect of desirable outcomes ( Ryan_&_Deci,_2000a,_2000b_CITE)."
"It is noteworthy that there may also be paradoxical effects of praise and blame on students motivation; however, these appear to be limited to specific circumstances, like excessive praise for success in a task perceived as very easy, or in a task that other students did not receive praise for (eg, Meyer,_1992;_Miller_&_Hom,_1996;_Kaspar_&_Stelz,_2013_CITE)"
"Similarly, negative effects of praise on students achievement have been reported in cases where praise has been administered unsystematically, ie, independent of the correctness of the students responses ( Brophy,_1981_CITE)"
"On a semantic level (ie, regarding the textual content of the utterances, not their prosody), at least the effects of computer-generated praise have been examined before ( Fogg_&_Nass,_1997_CITE)"
"Since this was the case with sincere praise (ie, praise described to participants as contingent upon correct responses) as well as with flattery (ie, praise described as independent of response correctness), the authors suggested that computers should praise people frequently even when there may be little basis for the evaluation ( Fogg_&_Nass,_1997_CITE, p_559)"
"Similarly, Mumm_and_Mutlu_(2011)_CITE observed an increase in self-reported motivation and willingness to continue with the task when written praise was given irrespective of participants actual task performance (speed in a letter-counting task)."
"In a previous experiment by Nass,_Foehr,_and_Somoza_(2001)_CITE, happy and sad stories that were presented in synthesized speech were rated as more likeable and more credible than the same stories presented in pre-recorded natural speech"
"Furthermore, Nass_et_al._(2001)_CITE used (natural and synthesized) sad and happy voices that were matched or mismatched with the sad and happy stories, and the authors acknowledge that the synthesized speech may have been perceived as less emotional, so the differences observed between synthesized and recorded speech might in fact rather be based on differences in emotionality/neutrality than on the speech modality per se"
"Important experimental differences notwithstanding, the results reported by Nass_et_al._(2001_CITE; see above) may suggest an advantage for computer-supported learning employing synthesized feedback"
"On the other hand, the CASA paradigm ( Reeves_&_Nass,_1996;_Nass_&_Moon,_2000_CITE; see Section 1.1) tells us that computers are perceived as social actors and are attributed with human properties by their users"
"One such preference that has been shown to occur in the interaction with machines as well as with humans is the preference for similarity (social identification; Tajfel_&_Turner,_1979_CITE)"
"For instance, users tend to prefer working with systems using same-gender voices ( Lee,_Nass,_&_Brave,_2000_CITE) and with systems displaying a similar personality to their own ( Nass_&_Lee,_2001_CITE)"
"Then again though this seems rather unlikely considering the abundance of natural speech-based appliances in today environment one should not neglect the possibility of contrary effects comparable to the uncanny valley effects in robotics and 3D computer animations, which refer to results showing that robots and avatars resembling humans are only accepted up to a certain degree of humanness and are rejected should they appear too human until they are not at all recognizable as technical systems anymore and therefore accepted as humans ( Mori,_1970;_MacDorman_&_Ishiguro,_2006;_Moore,_2012_CITE; for an equivalent rejection of partially human auditory computer interfaces, see Huang,_Lee,_Nass,_Paik,_&_Swartz,_2000_CITE)"
"First, although such a difference is above the threshold for just noticeable computer feedback delays when subjects are instructed to attend to seldom delays in feedback ( Miller,_1968;_Kohrs,_Angenstein,_Scheich,_&_Brechmann,_2010_CITE), the human computer dialogue is only disturbed if such a delay is unexpected ( Shneiderman_&_Plaisant,_2005_CITE)"
"Laird,_1985_CITE), since the average pitch difference between positive and negative feedback utterances as well as the pitch range within albeit only the positive feedback utterances are greater than they are in their prosodically neutral counterparts (see Table 1)"
"The observation that praise and blame were able to increase the learners performance in this way may at first glance appear to contradict repeated findings showing that praise (and in some cases blame) can undermine learners motivation and in turn decrease their effort and performance (eg, Lepper_&_Greene,_1978;_Mueller_&_Dweck,_1998;_Deci,_Koestner,_&_Ryan,_1999_CITE)"
"DeCharms,_1968_CITE) resulting in a failure to satisfy the basic psychological need for autonomy and a reduction of intrinsic motivation ( Deci_&_Ryan,_2000;_Ryan_&_Deci,_2000b_CITE), while negative effects of both praise and blame have been attributed to a shift in the learner mindset, achievement attributions, and resulting goal-orientation ( Ames,_1992;_Mueller_&_Dweck,_1998;_Kamins_&_Dweck,_1999;_Dweck,_2006_CITE; see also Ames,_1984;_Nicholls,_1984;_Dweck,_1986_CITE)."
"For one, Ryan_and_Deci_(2000a)_CITE state explicitly that the harmful effect an external reward (like praise) may have on an individual motivation to perform a specific task is clearly restricted to intrinsic motivation and therefore exclusively applies to tasks that are intrinsically motivating, ie, inherently interesting and enjoyable, to begin with"
"Kluger_and_DeNisi_(1996)_CITE report that computerized evaluative feedback leads to better performance since it directs the learner attention to task-learning processes while evaluative feedback given by a human supervisor directs the learner attention to self-related meta-task processes (eg, considerations about the supervisor intentions and their implications for the learner goals), consequently reducing task-involvement and performance."
"However, a previous study by Nass,_Moon,_and_Green_(1997)_CITE shows that praise given (to another computer) by a pre-recorded male voice is more convincing for an observer than praise given by a female voice, and research on human praise suggests that praise perceived as more sincere and credible is more effective ( Brophy,_1981;_Henderlong_&_Lepper,_2002_CITE)"
"Alternatively, when including participant gender as a factor, such an experiment may reveal an increased performance with feedback given by same-gender voices (ie, a learning advantage with male voices in male participants, and with female voices in female participants), based on the preference for working with systems using same-gender voices observed by Lee_et_al._(2000,_CITE cf"
"for example the positive effect of the usage of the personal pronoun I in pre-recorded speech, but not in synthesized speech; Huang_et_al.,_2000_CITE), future developers of intelligent tutoring systems will need to weigh the motivational power of natural speech with praising and blaming prosody against the convenience of automatic speech generation."
"In image analysis, the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) transformation is useful for developing image processing algorithms based on descriptions of colors that are natural to humans [16]_CITE"
There are existing nonlinear functions of features known to be effective (which can be interpreted as mathematical expression models) [17 21]_CITE
Genetic Programming (GP) employs tree structure representations to solve problems [22]_CITE
"With inductive learning algorithms of varying power, the GP has been successfully applied to various learning algorithms, including the feature synthesis approach which has demonstrated the superiority for diverse classification problems [20,23,24]_CITE"
"The Expectation Maximization (EM) is a widely used approach to learning in the presence of unobserved variables, such as in the applications of fitting high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models [24]_CITE and reducing the difference in feature distributions [25]_CITE"
A number of different approaches to computer-aided methods of image cell analysis have been studied for detecting disorders related to diseases [6 15]_CITE
"To extract cell objects from the background, selection of the optimal threshold was introduced in [5]_CITE using the zeroth- and first-order cumulative moments of the gray-level histogram"
"In [6]_CITE, an adaptive automatic threshold approach was applied to diagnosing pathological cancer cells and nuclei in the spaces of RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity)"
"Mathematical morphology provides an approach to extracting image components, such as size, shape, boundary and connectivity, and to eliminating irrelevancies for detecting various blood cells [11,12]_CITE and cancer cells [13]_CITE"
"Yet, the graphical model method, with a prior knowledge of object shapes, is able to provide a probabilistic model to represent the relationship among the image pixels, region labels and underlying object contour [7]_CITE"
"Combined with probability theory, the graph-based method offered advantages for the classification of subcellular protein patterns in fluorescence microscope images [7,8]_CITE"
"Alternatively, the active contour-based method was feasible and effective for leukocyte tracking problems, when tracking cells in vitro, using the information of the region [9]_CITE and the edge [10]_CITE."

Many practical problems have a class-conditional density that is approximately Gaussian [27 29]_CITE
"When the transformed data X=xii=1m, the input of the EM steps, with the k known classes are assumed under the mixture of the k Gaussians, the multivariate Gaussian mixture with a d-dimensional mean vector j and a d d covariance matrix j for the data X is given by [29,30]_CITE: (8)p(xi| )= j=1k jfj(xi| j)withfj(xi| j)=exp-12(xi- j)T j-1(xi- j)(2 )d| j|."
"In the linear discriminant analysis, the optimal discriminant vectors (transformation) are performed by the eigenvectors of the within-class matrix Sw and the between-class matrix SB [29]_CITE"
"Since maximizing the logarithm of a quantity also maximizes that quantity, we use this optimal partition measurement as the fitness function in the approach, named the J value [29]_CITE: (11)J=ln|SW-1SB|.where X j is the jth subset of X, nj is the number of samples in the jth class, T is the total mean vector and j is replaced with the mean of the jth Gaussian component."
"The areas below the ROC curves indicate the discrimination capabilities of the design systems [35,36]_CITE"
"The main reason is that the change due to optical distortion errors (associated with microscopy illumination effects) would be far less significant in the cumulative histogram, as compared to that change in standard histograms, because the continuous non-decreasing image representation is inherently noise-resistant [39]_CITE"
"It started gaining wide attention only in 2010, when Humble and Farley published the book titled Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation ( Humble_and_Farley,_2010_CITE)"
"According to a recent survey of 600 software developers, managers, and executives in the United States and the United Kingdom, only 3% of the respondents said they had no plans to adopt CD ( Perforce_Software_Inc_2015_CITE)."
"However, implementing CD can be quite challenging ( Chen,_2015,_Leppanen_et_al.,_2015,_Claps_et_al.,_2015_CITE)"
"Although CD as a goal (a target state) is no longer a new idea and has been well documented ( Humble_and_Farley,_2010_CITE), the adoption journey for CD is not yet a smooth path"
"However, eventually, we achieved huge benefits ( Chen,_2015_CITE)."
"Developing valuable software is a goal that has long been on the Agile manifesto ( Beck_et_al.,_2001_CITE)"
"Before adopting CD, some of our teams had been using an Agile method called Kanban ( Anderson,_2010_CITE); however, due to delivery problems, we still had situations where a team had completed a feature but could not deliver it to production to obtain users feedback"
"Many times, these releases would be followed by P1 (priority 1) incidents ( Rob,_2007_CITE), meaning that release activity was always full of uncertainty, failures, and stress"
"In academia, people tend to use it interchangeably with Continuous Delivery ( Rodr guez_et_al.,_2016_CITE)."
"According to this distinction, Continuous Delivery is compatible with a wide range of scenarios, but Continuous Deployment is suitable only under special conditions ( O'Dell_and_Skelton,_2016_CITE)"
"as discussed in ( Chen,_2015_CITE); breaking big features down into smaller ones so that each can be finished in a short time (eg, a week)."
"If the updated code passes all the stages, it can be released to production with the click of a button ( Chen,_2015_CITE)."
"CD implementation requires a considerable and continuous investment over a long period of time ( Savor_et_al.,_2016_CITE), but gaining sustained support in a dynamic complex enterprise environment is challenging"
"Apart from automating build, test, and deployment activities, introducing CD also requires changes to architecture activities ( Chen,_2015_CITE), software development practices, organizational structure and culture, and so forth."
"Moreover, the unavailability of testing environments often cause user stories to pile up in the ready for acceptance column of the teams' Kanban boards ( Anderson,_2010_CITE) ( Figure 2 ), causing further pain."
"For example, our support for technology stacks has been extended from only Java to Ruby, PHP, Javascript, Golang ( Donovan_and_Kernighan,_2015_CITE), Scala ( Odersky_et_al.,_2016_CITE), and .NET."
"The changes to the application itself may include such things as architectural changes ( Chen,_2015_CITE) and test coverage improvements; the changes to the development team's practices can include changes in architecture practices, testing activities, build processes, and so on"
"To move this application to CD, we needed to improve the architecture to satisfy the deployability, modifiability, and testability required by CD ( Chen,_2015_CITE)"
"It is generally easier for teams working on new applications to (re-) design the architecture in a way that is amenable to CD ( Chen,_2015_CITE)"
"For example, we ask new teams to use Kanban, Test Driven Development (TDD) ( Beck,_2002_CITE), Behavior Driven Development (BDD) ( Wynne_and_Hellesoy,_2012_CITE), and other, similar development methodologies."
"CD can significantly reduce the time to market and improve product quality ( Chen,_2015_CITE)"
"We mentioned organizational challenges in our earlier paper ( Chen,_2015_CITE)"
"However, apart from the points discussed in ( Chen,_2015_CITE), we recently noticed another area in which evidence-based results are important"
"Organizational structures can be a significant barrier when implementing CD ( Chen,_2015_CITE)"
"Although there is a large corpus of studies on organizational structures ( Perforce_Software_Inc_2016_CITE), we still need evidence-based results regarding the connections between CD and organizational structures"
"We also mentioned process challenges in our earlier work ( Chen,_2015_CITE)"
"For example, in our organization, we needed to create a change ticket, place the change request on the agenda of the next Change Advisory Board (CAB) meeting ( Rob,_2007_CITE), present the change at the meeting, receive CAB approval, confirm the deployment window, and so forth."
"Secure, because production systems will be in danger if it is subverted ( Bass_et_al.,_2015_CITE)."
"For example, Claps et al ( Claps_et_al.,_2015_CITE) reported that the need for adding additional computing power, network bandwidth, and memory to CI servers is a challenge"
"They consider adding more resources as a strategy ( Claps_et_al.,_2015_CITE)."
"In other words, we need to change to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) ( Mell_and_Grance,_2011_CITE)."
"According to our experience, there are probably more legacy systems than green field projects in the industry ( Bennett,_1995_CITE)"
"These legacy systems' architectures are usually not amenable to CD ( Chen,_2015_CITE)"
"However, little, if any, work has been reported that specifically seeks to understand and address this important type of software ( Rodr guez_et_al.,_2016_CITE)."
"Many works have reported challenges and solutions in adopting CD ( Leppanen_et_al.,_2015,_Claps_et_al.,_2015,_Olsson_et_al.,_2012,_Karvonen_et_al.,_2015,_Rissanen_and_M nch,_2015,_Marschall,_2007,_Zhu_et_al.,_2015,_Debbiche_et_al.,_2014,_Puneet,_2011,_Noureddine_and_Foutse,_2014,_Laukkanen_et_al.,_2015,_Rogers,_2004,_Sekitoleko_et_al.,_2014,_Krusche_and_Alperowitz,_2014,_Adams_et_al.,_2015,_Souza_et_al.,_2015,_Feitelson_et_al.,_2013,_Rahman_et_al.,_2015,_Neely_and_Stolt,_2013_CITE), including a very recent systematic literature review ( Laukkanen_et_al.,_2017_CITE)"
"As another example, Claps et al ( Claps_et_al.,_2015_CITE) also reported providing more resources to a product's CI servers as a strategy to adopt CD"
"Motivated by the huge benefits reported ( Chen,_2015,_Leppanen_et_al.,_2015_CITE), many practitioners want to implement CD in their organizations ( Perforce_Software_Inc_2015_CITE)"
"However, implementing CD can be very challenging ( Chen,_2015,_Leppanen_et_al.,_2015,_Claps_et_al.,_2015_CITE)."
"Model checking allows the software developer to describe correctness properties with specification languages such as Temporal Logic ( Manna_and_Pnueli,_1992_CITE)"
"The most common use of LTL is to express complex liveness behaviors of infinite traces, which are the traces produced by reactive and/or concurrent software ( Manna_and_Pnueli,_1992_CITE)."
"Other monitor based approaches adapt the semantics of full LTL to finite executions, as done by Java PathExplorer ( Havelund_and_Ro u,_2004_CITE)"
"Tools such as Verisoft ( Godefroid,_1997_CITE) and CMC ( Stoller,_2002_CITE) avoid storing the states of the program during monitoring, so they can perform a partial analysis of very large systems with little memory consumption"
"The analysis of an LTL formula along one or several potential infinite execution paths cannot be carried out with standard monitors, but requires storing the states of the program and the use of algorithms based on automata to recognize special cycles, like B chi automata ( Clarke_et_al.,_1999_CITE)"
"Stateful approaches, like the one implemented in Java PathFinder ( Visser_et_al.,_2003_CITE) (JPF) keep a stack with the current execution trace to control backtracking, to produce counter-examples and to check cycles, so they could check LTL on infinite traces"
"The use of LTL formulas and a reduced set of variables of interest produces traces as counterexamples, which are very valuable when locating bugs ( Clarke_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"This is specially relevant in concurrent programs where it is usually more important and difficult to find interleaving of actions that produce faults, than failure-inducing test inputs ( Baiardi_et_al.,_1986_CITE)"
"While the analysis of the traces for finding the root cause is still a manual process, the formulas and the selected variables of interest significantly reduce the size of the traces to analyze ( Alipour,_2012_CITE)."
"Spin implements the algorithms by Vardi_and_Wolper_(1986)_CITE to check LTL properties, which are based in the translation of the negated LTL formula into a B chi automaton"
"Hash-compact ( Wolper_et_al.,_1993_CITE) reduces the use of memory by compressing the representation of the states without losing information"
"Bit-state hashing ( Holzmann,_1995_CITE) represents states as single bits in a hash table, which may lead to a partial analysis of the model in some cases"
"Currently, work is being carried out in order to obtain parallel versions of Spin that preserve most of these optimizations ( Holzmann_and_Bosnacki,_2007_CITE)"
"Finally, there are other strategies that deal with scalability, such as the automatic transformation of the models to implement abstraction methods ( Gallardo_et_al.,_2004_CITE) or the abstract matching proposed in ( de_la_C mara_et_al.,_2010_CITE)."
"The tool TJT and several examples can be downloaded from ( Adalid_et_al.,_xxxx_CITE)."
"Unmatched variables are restored when backtracking, but they are not taken into account when deciding whether two states are equal (see ( Holzmann,_2003_CITE) for details)"
"The effect of this projection is similar to that of the cone of influence technique ( Clarke_et_al.,_1999_CITE)"
"We are interested in the likelyhood of a birthday attack ( Schneier,_1995_CITE), ie the probability of a collision between any two states belonging to the same trace or, conversely, in the number of different states that could be generated before a collision is found with a given probability"
"In this section, we show some example properties evaluated on public open source Java projects, some of which were also evaluated in ( Fu_et_al.,_2005_CITE)"
"Note that all formulas, with the exception of F4 and F6, represent liveness properties, and, in the case of programs with infinite executions, they can only be analyzed with runtime checkers that implement mechanisms like the cycle detection considered in this paper (see Vardi_and_Wolper_(1986)_CITE)."
"Java PathExplorer, developed by Havelund and Ro u ( Havelund_and_Ro u,_2004_CITE), uses the rewriting-logic based model checker Maude to check LTL on finite execution traces of Java programs"
"Java PathExplorer also supports the generation of a variant of B chi automata for finite traces developed by Giannakopoulou and Havelund ( Giannakopoulou_and_Havelund,_2001_CITE)"
"The tool Temporal Rover ( Drusinsky,_2000_CITE) can check temporal logic assertions against reactive systems (with non-terminating loops) at runtime"
"Bodden ( Bodden,_2004_CITE) uses AspectJ to implement a method to evaluate LTL, inserting pieces of Java code to be executed at points where the behavior specified by the formula is relevant and must be evaluated"
"d Amorim and Havelund ( d Amorim_and_Havelund,_2005_CITE) have developed the tool HAWK for the runtime verification of Java programs, which allows the definition of temporal properties with the logic EAGLE"
"FiLM (Finite LTL runtime Monitor) ( Zhang_et_al.,_2009_CITE) also gives a specific semantics to LTL to check both safety and liveness in finite traces"
"One is to apply static influence analysis to automatically select the variables relevant to the given property, as we proposed in ( de_la_C mara_et_al.,_2006_CITE)"
"Critically, since aircraft and their engines are tremendously large and powerful systems, carrying out representative experimental tests is costly, indeed typically around 1 million [1]_CITE"
The many hundreds of turbulence models available [2]_CITE to the engineer gives stark testimony to the battle that both scientists and engineers have had to deal with turbulence.
"In the 1970s Chapman [3]_CITE proposed that when computers reached about 10 14 FLOPS, billion cell, three-dimensional, unsteady, calculations would be possible and that these would be able to resolve much of the turbulence energy in the flow"
"Indeed as pointed out by Jameson [4]_CITE, computer power has increased by a factor of 1 million in the past 25 years"
"Pope [5]_CITE estimates that for a Boeing 777 at cruise, there are around 0.1 billion of these streak structures, requiring grids on the order of 1 billion cells"
Similar estimates for an Airbus A340-300 fuselage suggest around 2 billion streaks [6]_CITE
Great impetus to the use of Eddy resolving simulations (ERS) in aerospace was given by Spalart in 1997 [7]_CITE [8]_CITE
"Very soon after this, work emerged at the US Air Force Laboratory applying the approach to full fighter aircraft configurations, culminating in agreement between real flight test data for tail buffet [9]_CITE"
Considerable campaigns on missile base flows were also carried out along with landing gear and wings with flaps at high angles [10]_CITE to name but a few
"An example of this would be compressor performance near stall, where much flow, akin to that observed in Spalart pioneering NACA 0012 work will be observed along with a multiplicity of many other complex unsteady vortical physical mechanisms [10]_CITE"
"For example, there are the ribbed passages that are essential for cooling the turbine blades which operate at above the melting point of typical metals [11,12]_CITE"
In this zone it is compelling to start using ERS now in industry [14]_CITE
(This is demonstrated by Goldstein [15]_CITE through rearranging the Navier Stokes equations to separate noise generation and propagation terms)
"For example, Ray and Dawes [16]_CITE perform Spalart Allmaras DES and Tucker et al [17]_CITE RANS NLES of a transonic fan blade section"
"At high frequencies, empirical models [18]_CITE suggest turbulent boundary layers exhibit a f 5 scaling while at intermediate frequencies a f 1 scaling"
Even for the simple case of an aero engine propulsive jet there are a multitude of upstream turbulence inputs [19]_CITE
Such aspects of modeling real complex inflow are discussed in [10]_CITE and are of some importance when considering practical systems.
"Indeed, even though there are an extensive range of numerical methods available, most practical compressible flow CFD is made with Roe based ideas [20]_CITE and this scheme, when designed, was not intended for ERS"
"Preconditioning will help, to an extent, but gives rise to excessive numerical stiffness at low M [10]_CITE"
"As shown by Ghosal [21]_CITE, on theoretical grounds, higher order schemes are ideal"
It is also worth bearing in mind that a scheme that is dissipative at high wave numbers could make a useful Implicit LES (ILES) model (see [22]_CITE)
"Currently, up to 90% of computational performance is wasted, usually bound by memory and network bandwidth [23,24]_CITE"
"This includes but is not limited to communication avoiding methods such as tiling [23]_CITE and potentially, time-parallel methods such as Parareal [25]_CITE"
Fig_9 shows simulations for homogenous decaying turbulence for different cell types in an unstructured flow solver [26]_CITE
Jameson [4]_CITE presents a kinetic energy conserving scheme
The red line labeled Realistic scaling is adjusted [28]_CITE to take into account that many simulations are considerably more extensive than just chord-wise sections
"Then, the latter would be used as part of larger system level calculations or the ERS sandwiched within such calculations (see [29]_CITE)"
Huang studied periodic orbit of k M set when k is a positive integer [2]_CITE
"Gujar and Dhurandhar explored the structure of k M set where k is a real number [3,4]_CITE"
Shirriff researched characteristics of k M set where k is a complex number [5]_CITE.
Wang explored escape time of M-set [6]_CITE
Noah analyzed the radius of M-set [7]_CITE
Pastor and Ashish analyzed chaotic features of M-set [8 9]_CITE
"Fractal is widely used with computer techniques [10 12,14]_CITE when M-set continues to attract researchers attentions [13]_CITE."
"Falconer [14]_CITE gives the following extended M Set definition: Definition 1Let fc0(0)=c, fci(0)=fci-1(0)2+c, where i is a natural number"
The straight skeleton S(P) of a simple polygon P was introduced by Aichholzer et al [1]_CITE and is defined by considering the propagation of a so-called wavefront
"(iii) For input that is not in general position even more complex interactions such as vertex-events or multi-split-events are possible [2,3]_CITE"
"Several algorithms are known for constructing unweighted straight skeletons, such as those by Aichholzer et al [1]_CITE, Eppstein and Erickson [2]_CITE, Cheng and Vigneron [6]_CITE, Huber and Held [3]_CITE, or Vigneron and Yan [7]_CITE."
"Das et al [8]_CITE suggested an algorithm for constructing the (unweighted) straight skeleton of monotone polygons, which they claim runs in O(nlog n) time, where n denotes the number of vertices of the polygon"
Recently Biedl et al [4]_CITE showed that many of the seemingly obvious properties of straight skeletons no longer hold when weights are not unit weights
Biedl et al [4]_CITE showed that for simple polygons and positive weights the straight skeleton is still a tree
"The straight skeleton of a monotone polygon might contain cycles, and even for a convex polygon it may be self-intersecting [4]_CITE."
"As regards the breaking onset criterion, two types of methodology were adopted, which rely (i) on the time derivative of the free surface elevation [14]_CITE or (ii) on the free surface slope [15]_CITE"
"As discussed in [16]_CITE, it can be demonstrated that the two mentioned approaches are equivalent as regards to their effect on the momentum equation."
"As demonstrated by Chen et al [23]_CITE, its application to the two-dimensional case is straightforward."
"Concerning the surface roller approach, Svendsen [24]_CITE defined the roller as the volume of water carried by the wave with the wave celerity on the front of a breaking wave"
"For example, Sch ffer et al [15]_CITE applied the concept of the surface roller of a breaking wave in order to compute some additional terms in the momentum equation"
The work was extended by Madsen et al [18]_CITE to the two dimensional case
Veeramony and Svendsen [19]_CITE included vorticity explicitly by deriving a weakly-nonlinear one-dimensional model starting from the Reynolds-averaged equations and by allowing horizontal vorticity to be introduced within the domain
"Musumeci et al [22]_CITE extended such an approach by deriving a fully nonlinear version of the model, in order to obtain better shoaling properties close to the breaking point, and by implementing an original algorithm in order to avoid loss of vorticity."
"Although such an assumption seems to be in contrast with the actual evolution of vorticity which is three-dimensional [25]_CITE, it is acceptable near the front face of the breaking wave, ie where the greatest amount of dissipation appears [25]_CITE."
"In order to model the turbulent shear stresses, an eddy viscosity t is introduced, which in dimensionless term is (7) t= tC h0 gh0 ,where t is the dimensionless eddy viscosity and C is a coefficient which can be empirically estimated to be about 0.01 0.03 [26]_CITE."
"Several choices are possible, as the depth-averaged velocity or the velocity at a specific elevation; an extensive discussion about the consequences of each choice is reported in Madsen and Sch ffer [4]_CITE"
"Moreover the well-known linear operator L=1+B 2h2 2, proposed by Madsen and Sch ffer [27]_CITE to improve the dispersion characteristics of the model in deeper water, has been used here."
"It must be noticed that in Eq (20) the dependency on the rotational velocity ur, which in turn is a function of the vorticity injected inside the flow by the breaking mechanism, is included exclusively in the terms ( M), ( M1), ( P)t,Dw, (Dsv+Dsh) and Duw, which, in analogy to the work of Veeramony and Svendsen [19]_CITE, are called breaking terms"
"For the one-dimensional flow case, such terms reduce to those found by Musumeci et al [22]_CITE"
Watanabe et al [28]_CITE have shown that undulations are present in the rear part of the primary vortex
The bending of horizontal eddies has been studied also by Ting [29]_CITE for the solitary wave case by means of PIV measurements
"Moreover Ting and Nelson [30]_CITE found that although the offshore transport of turbulence energy continued until the next breaker arrived, transport of turbulence energy perpendicular to the bed was confined to sporadic areas around impingement points after the growth phase"
"Indeed, the velocity component in the direction orthogonal to the wave ray, which is responsible of the vorticity stretching, should be proportional to the longshore current which in turn is proportional to the gradient of the water depth [31]_CITE"
"As regards the depth-dependency of t, [21]_CITE investigated the effects of several eddy viscosity profiles numerically integrating Eq (25)"
"At the offshore boundary an absorbing-generating boundary condition is applied, similar to that proposed by Vandongeren and Svendsen [32]_CITE in their nonlinear shallow water equation model; however in the present case the forcing term includes also the dispersive effects which are taken into account in Boussinesq models."
"In analogy to the work of Veeramony and Svendsen [19]_CITE, the hydraulic similarity between breaking waves and hydraulic jumps has been used here to specify the geometry of the surface roller and the value of along the lower edge of the roller, whose elevation is e"
"In particular such a task has been accomplished by using two functions obtained as best fit of the experimental data obtained for low Froude number hydraulic jumps by Svendsen et al [33]_CITE: (36) sh2 U1=15.751-x lr, (37) e= -0.78h2 e-x lrx lr-x 2lr2,where is the ratio h2/h1,h1 and h2 represent the minimum water depth before the jump and the undisturbed water depth downstream with respect to the jump, respectively, U1 is a supercritical reference velocity, and x is the horizontal coordinate, which for breaking waves is equivalent to a reference system moving at the wave speed."
"The relation used here, initially introduced by Sch ffer and Madsen [15]_CITE, is (38)tan =tan 0+tan B-tan 0exp-ln2 -tBt1/2in which represents the time interval measured from the initiation of wave breaking, t1/2 defines the time scale for the development of the roller, and tB is the time of incipient breaking"
"In the past S rensen et al [34]_CITE faced such a problem by using a staggered grid for the determination of the toe points, by assuming a linear variation between two toe points and by defining the roller as the area comprised between each couple of toe points and the projection on the horizontal plane of the two lines tangential to the direction of wave propagation."
"Such an approach represents a simplification of the 1DH solution scheme used by Musumeci et al [22]_CITE, in which the vorticity is solved along the so called moving subgrid and where a more detailed description of the breaking related loss of energy is carried out."
"The model results are compared with experimental data in Fig_9 (a), while the same comparison obtained by means of the 1D Boussinesq model of Musumeci et al [22]_CITE is shown as a reference ( Fig_9(b))"
"In both models such a behavior overlaps the experimental results of [36]_CITE, which are expressed by the black diamonds in the same Fig_9"
"Indeed, in the proposed model the values of the gradient are calculated on the staggered grid, so causing a spatial averaging of variables, whereas in Musumeci et al [22]_CITE a polynomial interpolation was adopted"
"In order to compare the velocity field induced by turbulent motion under spilling breakers, another validation has been carried out considering the laboratory study of Huang et al [37]_CITE"
The velocity fields measured within the surf zone by Huang et al [37]_CITE are shown in Fig_10 .
The results are plotted in such a way to allow a direct comparison with the available experimental data [37]_CITE.
"The magnitude of such horizontal vorticity is comparable to that observed in the 1DH version of the model, as it was shown by Briganti et al [21]_CITE in Fig_7"
Moreover Dimakopoulos and Dimas [38]_CITE considered the average ratio of these components in the roller area and they obtained that the direction of the resulting horizontal vorticity is almost perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation
"The above comparison allows us to analyse the vorticity behavior in a more complex case, ie the submerged shoal studied by Vincent and Briggs [39]_CITE"
"Such a feature has been analyzed in the one dimensional case by Briganti et al [21]_CITE, who investigated the effects of a depth variant eddy viscosity, by solving numerically the vorticity transport equation in the model of Musumeci et al [22]_CITE"
"From a visual comparison between such experimental data and the vorticity distribution in the 1DH version of the proposed model, (see Fig_19 of [22]_CITE) it is possible to observe that such a numerical model underestimates the vorticity under the wave trough"
Indeed in Fig_19 of Nadaoka et al [25]_CITE a maximum value of vorticity of about 7 Hz is present under the trough of the wave
"Since, Nadaoka et al [25]_CITE found that the greatest values of vorticity are present in the correspondence of horizontal eddies, it can be stated that the present model is at least able to capture the leading order vortical motion under breaking waves."
"Furthermore, the same data set was considered to validate the previous one-dimensional version of the present model (ie [19,22]_CITE)"
"Concerning the two-dimensional applications of the proposed model, the vorticity dynamics under breaking waves were investigated for the shoal case of Vincent and Briggs [39]_CITE"
"As reported in Musumeci et al [22]_CITE, the expressions used for computing the breaking terms were derived assuming that for the O( 2) terms, namely Psst,Duw, M1 and Dw, the contribution coming from the roller region was assumed to be small"
"Predicting the effort required to create software has been based on numerous software size models such as the Constructive Cost Model ( Anandhi_and_Chezian,_2014;_Clark,_1996;_Manalif_et al.,_2014_CITE) and all its alternatives ( Attarzadeh_and_Ow,_2011;_Kazemifard_et al.,_2011;_Tadayon,_2004;_Yang_et al.,_2006_CITE) as well as on function points ( Borandag_et al.,_2016_CITE) and analogy based models ( Idri_et al.,_2015_CITE)"
"One significant approach to software size prediction is the Use Case Points (UCP) method, which is a prediction model based on the work of Karner_(1993)_CITE"
"As reported in Silhavy_et al.,_(2015a,b_CITE) UCP has some important drawbacks"
"Analogy based size estimation is commonly used for prediction in all the methods mentioned above ( Idri_et al.,_2015;_Shepperd_and_MacDonell,_2012_CITE)"
"Many researchers have addressed effort estimation and, therefore, consider productivity factors (PFs) ( Wang_et al.,_2009_CITE), but they do not address the possibility of potentially inappropriate variables in the UCP algorithm itself, which is important for software size estimation"
"Karner's original UCP method ( Karner,_1993_CITE) identifies three groups: simple, average and complex"
"There have also been several modifications of the original UCP principles including use case size points ( Braz_and_Vergilio,_2006_CITE), extended UCP ( Wang_et al.,_2009_CITE), modified UCP ( Diev,_2006_CITE), adapted UCP ( Mohagheghi_et al.,_2005_CITE), and transaction or path analysis ( Robiolo_et al.,_2009_CITE)."
The use case size points method was evaluated in Braz_and_Vergilio_(2006_CITE)
"Robiolo_et al.,_(2009_CITE) improved transactions by calculating paths by which the complexity of each transaction is based on the number of binary or multiple conditions used in the scenarios"
"Their approach is based on Robiolo_and_Orosco_(2008)_CITE, where number of transactions is equal to the number of stimuli"
"Ochodek_et al.,_(2011a)_CITE discusses a reliability of transaction identification process and Jurkiewicz_et al._(2015_CITE) discusses event identification in use cases, which should be useful for path identification."
"Wang_et al.,_(2009)_CITE proposed an extended UCP in that employed fuzzy sets and a Bayesian belief network used to set unadjusted UCP"
"Diev_(2006)_CITE noted that when the actors and use cases are precisely defined, unadjusted UCP (the sum of the UAW and the UUCW) can be multiplied by the technical factors"
The product of the technical complexity factors (see Table 3) and unadjusted UCP is considered as the coefficient of the base system complexity in Diev_(2006_CITE)
"According to Nageswaran_(2001_CITE), added effort must be taken to consider support activities such as configuration management or testing."
"Yet another modification to the UCP is called adapted UCP ( Mohagheghi_et al.,_2005_CITE)"
"Ochodek_et al.,_(2011b)_CITE also proposed omitting UAW and the decomposition of use cases into smaller ones, which are then classified into the typical three use case categories."
"However, the existing use case-based estimation methods have some well-known issues ( Diev,_2006_CITE)"
"Analogy based estimation methods are discussed in Azzeh_et al.,_(2015b)_CITE, which evaluated 40 variants of the single adjustment method using four performance measures and eight test datasets"
Amasaki_and_Lokan_(2015)_CITE addressed the problem of selecting projects using a linear regression model by testing the window principle
"Rosa_et al.,_(2014)_CITE investigated whether a linear model based on both size and application type was better than a model based on size only; however, this study did not investigate the effects of each variable nor evaluate additional types of regression models."
"L pez-Mart n_(2015)_CITE described linear regression models as less accurate than neural networks, but they provided no description of the regression models studied"
"A discussion of variable significance can be found in Urbanek_et al.,_(2015a)_CITE"
"Silhavy_et al.,_(2015a,_2015b_CITE) offered a linear model obtained by the least squares approach, in which two prediction coefficients were used to adjust the UAW and the UUCW"
"Urbanek_et al.,_2015b_CITE used a symbolic regression tool, analytic programming, together with differential evolution."
"Nassif_et al.,_(2013)_CITE presented a linear regression model with a logarithmic transformation that they created to estimate software effort from use case diagrams"
"In Nassif_et al.,_(2011)_CITE, a multiple linear regression model was developed to predict the values of the productivity factor"
"To adjust the values of the productivity factor, they first employed a fuzzy logic approach ( Nassif_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Then, they created an artificial neural network (multi-layer perceptron) model ( Azzeh_and_Nassif,_2016;_Nassif_et al.,_2015;_Nassif_et al.,_2012,_2013_CITE)."
"Actors play roles in the UAW variables ( Azzeh_et al.,_2015a;_Silhavy_et al.,_2015a_CITE)"
"The complexity of a use case is based on the number of scenario steps or, sometimes, on the number of transactions it contains ( Ochodek_et al.,_2011a_CITE)"
"MLR models depend on assumptions, and when those assumptions are violated, data transformation ( Christensen,_2006_CITE) may be required"
"A substantial number of these have been developed by operational researchers over the past 50 years, although the term problem structuring itself was only introduced into the operational research (OR) lexicon a couple of decades ago ( Rosenhead,_1989,_2006;_Rosenhead_and_Mingers,_2001,_2004_CITE)"
"A distinguishing feature of PSMs, compared with many other participative methods developed by social scientists, is the use of models as transitional objects to structure stakeholder engagement ( Eden_and_Sims,_1979;_Eden_and_Ackermann,_2006_CITE) and provide a focus for dialogue ( Franco,_2006_CITE)"
"Usually, models are qualitative and are constructed collectively in a workshop, but sometimes they are brought in by a facilitator based on previous inputs from participants and are used to orientate engagement: the model plays a key role in driving the process of negotiation towards agreement through discussion and the development of a common understanding ( Franco,_2006_CITE, p_766)"
"However, a common understanding does not necessarily imply consensus or agreement across the board: it may be an agreed understanding of the differences between people perspectives and what accommodations are possible in the circumstances ( Checkland_and_Scholes,_1990_CITE)"
"Qualitative models have traditionally been produced on flip charts using marker pens, but computer-mediated modelling is increasing in popularity, and this can facilitate remotely distributed and/or anonymous stakeholder participation, bringing advantages compared with face-to-face, pen and paper modelling ( Er_and_Ng,_1995;_Fjermestad,_2004;_Fan_et_al.,_2007_CITE)."
"What is clear from the literature, however, is that only a very small minority of studies (eg, Valacich_and_Schwenk,_1995a;_Halvorsen,_2001;_Rouwette_et_al.,_2011_CITE) seek to compare between methods or across case studies undertaken by different researchers"
"A particularly significant study was undertaken by Beierle_and_Cayford_(2002)_CITE, who quantitatively compared broad classes of methods using a standard set of variables applied to 239 case studies of public participation"
"We suggest that the use of systemic PSMs is relatively intensive compared with several of the other participative processes investigated by Beierle_and_Cayford_(2002)_CITE, so this gives us grounds to be cautiously optimistic"
"Rowe_and_Frewer_(2004)_CITE, reflecting on social science approaches to evaluating participative methods, classify them into three types"
"Rowe_and_Frewer_(2004)_CITE call the third and final type of evaluation, which the majority of researchers use, specific"
"White_(2006)_CITE argues that very similar distinctions have been made in the OR and group decision support literatures, and preferences for universality (to a greater or lesser extent) or specificity reflect the positivist and interpretivist paradigms respectively"
"Positivists are said to argue for objective, quantitative, comparative studies that are capable of revealing the generalisable advantages and disadvantages of different methods, although (like Rowe_and_Frewer,_2004_CITE) many are forced by the impracticality of undertaking truly universal studies to resort to more local quasi-experiments in either the laboratory or the field"
"Authors in this tradition include Nunamaker_et_al._(1991),_Fjermestad_and_Hiltz_(1998),_Pinsonneault_et_al._(1999),_Fjermestad_(2004)_and_Joldersma_and_Roelofs_(2004)_CITE"
"In contrast, interpretivists (such as Eden,_1995;_Eden_and_Ackermann,_1996;_Shaw,_2003_CITE) argue that what matters most in an evaluation is what is achieved by the method in a given context, judged from the perspectives of stakeholders"
"Our epistemological argument is that knowledge (or understanding) is always linked to the purposes and values of those producing or using it, and is dependent on the boundary judgements that they make ( Churchman,_1970;_Ulrich,_1994;_Alr e,_2000;_Midgley,_2000_CITE)"
"This argument is consistent with the epistemological assumptions made by most of the creators of PSMs ( Jackson,_2006_CITE)."
"Our second methodological argument, following Eden_(1995)_CITE and others, is that only seeking knowledge about the supposedly generic strengths and weaknesses of methods ignores legitimate questions that can be asked about the effectiveness of those methods in particular local circumstances"
There can also be problems with what Rowe_and_Frewer_(2004)_CITE call local evaluations (comparing more limited sets of methods in smaller scale research projects)
"Some have called for objective local studies rather than the simple reporting of subjective impressions ( Pinsonneault_et_al.,_1999;_Rowe_and_Frewer,_2004;_Rowe_et_al.,_2005_CITE)"
"However, when the pursuit of objectivity involves a retreat into the laboratory to conduct controlled experiments (eg, Valacich_and_Schwenk,_1995b;_Montazemi_et_al.,_1996;_Delaney_et_al.,_1997_CITE), then the validity of the comparison of methods has been questioned due to the artificiality of the situation ( Eden,_1995;_Er_and_Ng,_1995;_Shaw,_2003;_White,_2006_CITE)"
"While we accept that laboratory experiments are valid when some technical questions are being investigated, such as whether computer mediation enables the capture of more participants statements than use of a flip chart ( Gallupe_et_al.,_1992;_Fjermestad,_2004;_Fan_et_al.,_2007_CITE), we suggest that questions relating to the performance of methods in the context of stakeholder disagreement and conflict are another matter entirely"
"If quasi-experiments are established in the field instead of the laboratory, then this raises other problems: McAllister_(1999)_CITE argues that it is unethical to use a control when dealing with real community issues, and Duignan_and_Casswell_(1989)_CITE simply point to the impracticality of finding two situations that are sufficiently alike to make a comparative study robust."
"Kelly_and_Van_Vlaenderen_(1995),_McKay_(1998),_Jenkins_and_Bennett_(1999),_De_Vreede_and_Dickson_(2000),_Gopal_and_Prasad_(2000)_and_Allsop_and_Taket_(2003)_CITE advocate emergent methodologies: ie, ones where criteria for evaluation emerge through engagement with stakeholders"
"Eden_(1995)_CITE makes the important point that most interventions are complex, and researchers can rarely anticipate everything that will become important, so the evaluation approach needs to be able to respond to the unexpected."
"Nevertheless, several researchers claim that cross case study learning is possible, with two or more research teams reflecting on similarities and differences between cases (eg, McAllister,_1999;_Yearley,_2006;_White,_2006_CITE)"
"Checkland_(1981)_CITE argues that evaluating a systemic methodology depends on the long term accumulation of evidence from a diverse range of applications, giving progressively more confidence that the approach is useful across contexts: it is only through such an accumulation of evidence that the efficacy (does it work in the ways claimed?), effectiveness (is it the best approach for what is needed?) and efficiency (are maximum benefits gained at minimum cost?) of an approach can be reasonably assessed (also see Checkland_et_al.,_1990;_Zhang_et_al.,_1997_CITE)."
"It would appear from the literature that most researchers accept the logic of interpretivism and are more inclined to undertake specific, locally meaningful evaluations (and possibly learn across these) than attempt comparisons between methods using generic, quantitative measures ( Mingers_and_Rosenhead,_2004;_White,_2006_CITE)"
"White_(2006)_CITE argues that the debate in the problem structuring research community has become unhelpfully polarised, with many advocates on both sides taking purist positions and spurning methods that could enhance their own evaluation practices"
"A difficult balance has to be struck between rigour and relevance ( Shaw,_1999_CITE) because if the former is unquestioningly prioritised then there is good evidence that stakeholders will not co-operate ( Rowe_et_al.,_2005_CITE)"
"In sympathy with White s_(2006)_CITE pragmatic intent, we set out to propose an evaluation approach that supports locally meaningful evaluations and is capable of generating data for longer-term quantitative comparisons between methods without compromising local relevance"
"The overall framework is based in the tradition of multi-method systemic intervention (eg, Flood_and_Jackson,_1991;_Jackson,_1991,_2000;_Flood_and_Romm,_1996;_Mingers_and_Brocklesby,_1997;_Mingers_and_Gill,_1997;_Midgley,_2000,_2003;_Taket_and_White,_2000;_Burns,_2007_CITE), but instruments can be employed as part of the emergent evaluation of methods that enable data gathering for both immediate local and longer-term comparative use"
"We note that it is possible to develop much more elaborate conceptual frameworks than ours, with strong utility for research (eg, Champion_and_Wilson,_2010_CITE)"
"Buysse_et_al._(1999)_and_McAllister_(1999)_CITE advocate the exploration of both purposes and context, but tend to take as given the nature of the method to be evaluated"
"Pinsonneault_and_Kraemer_(1990),_Flood_(1995),_McGurk_et_al._(2006)_and_Rouwette_et_al._(2009)_CITE ask researchers to reflect on the adequacy of their contextual analyses, their choices of methods or processes and their intervention outcomes"
"This is an important issue for us (and is represented in Fig_1 by the text in the lower parts of the four ellipses) because our experience is that the researcher becomes an interactive part of the situation in which he or she is seeking to intervene using systemic PSMs (also see Checkland,_1981_CITE), and his or her identity and relationships can significantly affect the trajectory of an intervention ( Brocklesby,_1997;_Mingers,_1997;_Midgley_et_al.,_2007_CITE)."
Relevant aspects of context identified by Jackson_and_Keys_(1984)_CITE are the complexity of the issue being addressed using a systemic method and the relationships between the participants
"In contrast, Margerum_(2002)_CITE identifies potential contextual inhibitors of effective participation: a low level of commitment by key decision makers; parochialism (which can negatively affect inclusiveness); participants having inadequate skills and abilities; operational issues preventing the implementation of ideas; a lack of strategic thinking beyond the exercise at hand; poor leadership; and scarcity of resources"
"Ong_(2000)_CITE discusses the facilitative effects of strong social capital, and Alberts_(2007)_CITE documents the negative effects of participant inexperience and ignorance of technical issues"
Branch_and_Bradbury_(2006)_CITE claim that a key aspect of context is managerial attitude: especially the disclosure (or not) of relevant information; whether managers set agendas unilaterally or are open to power sharing; whether or not there is mutual respect in relationships; whether there is accountability to stakeholders; and whether or not people believe that a transparent decision making process will be used following stakeholder participation
"McCartt_and_Rohrbaugh_(1995)_CITE argue that a key aspect of managerial attitude is openness to change, and participative methods are often ineffective without it"
"Kelly_and_Van_Vlaenderen_(1995)_and_Brocklesby_(2009)_CITE concentrate on stakeholder interactions, looking at how patterns of mistrust and miscommunication can become established and affect the use of participative methods"
"Related to this is the identity of the researcher: Midgley_et_al._(2007)_CITE discuss how identity issues can make a significant difference to the quality of relationships, and hence the success or failure of a method (this is represented in Fig_1 by the lower half of the context ellipse)"
"No doubt the list of possible aspects of context could be extended indefinitely ( Gopal_and_Prasad,_2000_CITE), and different issues will be relevant in different situations, so we argue that it is more useful to give some methodological guidelines for exploring context in local situations than it is to provide a generic inventory of variables"
"Underpinning different boundary judgements may be quite different perspectives on the nature of the context ( Churchman,_1970_CITE)"
"Therefore, exploring diverse perspectives (eg, as advocated by Checkland_(1981)_CITE) may lead to the identification of alternative possible ways of bounding a contextual analysis ( Ulrich,_1994_CITE)."
"Establishing a boundary for analysis involves making a value judgement on what issues and stakeholders are important or peripheral ( Ulrich,_1994_CITE)"
"It is also useful to identify conflicts between people making different value judgements as well as processes of marginalisation that may constrain stakeholder participation or make the discussion of some phenomena taboo (eg, Midgley,_2000_CITE)."
"Any such system can have its own agenda, rationality and momentum that may come to dominate an intervention ( Douglas,_1986;_Luhmann,_1986;_Brocklesby,_2009_CITE), yet organisational systems still have to interact with others, and tensions can result ( Paterson_and_Teubner,_1998_CITE)"
"There may be socio-economic and ecological systems providing resources that can be used constructively by participants, or these systems may impose limits on what is achievable without incurring negative side-effects ( Clayton_and_Radcliffe,_1996_CITE)"
"Economic issues may point to concerns about social justice, which (if present) could influence people perceptions of the effects of systemic PSMs: ie, the use of a particular method may be seen as supportive of just or unjust social relationships ( Jackson,_1991,_2006_CITE), so it can be useful to look at the effects of socio-economic systems as part of boundary critique"
"Taking explicit account of ecological systems can also enhance boundary critique by challenging a tendency to uncritically resort to boundaries defining exclusively human systems, thereby marginalising the ecological ( Midgley,_1994_CITE)"
"Pettigrew_(1987)_CITE notes that wider systemic (eg, socio-economic and ecological) contexts not only influence perceptions of methods and processes, but also the content of participants deliberations."
"Within and across ecological, economic, social and organisational systems, there may be important causal pathways, and in particular feedback loops, that can point to systemic enablers of, or constraints on, an intervention (eg, Forrester,_1969_CITE)"
"Bateson_(1970)_CITE argues that it is important not to cut relevant feedback loops, and again this is a good principle to inform boundary critique: when we see interconnections stretching beyond people usual understandings of context we can ask whether it is important to widen the boundaries of analysis to account for these."
"Purposes are closely linked with values and motivations ( McAllister,_1999_CITE), and they are important to an evaluation because particular methods are likely to appear more or less useful depending on the purposes being pursued"
"Different methods are generally good for different things ( Flood_and_Jackson,_1991_CITE), and it is the perceived fit between purpose and method that is important to evaluate: a disjunction may be responsible for an attribution of failure."
"These may significantly affect the trajectory of an intervention (for instance through sabotage), and thereby the evaluation of the method used ( Ho,_1997_CITE)"
"It is also useful to look out for mismatches between articulated purposes and ones attributed by others (both to individuals and organisations) because mismatches of this kind often signal mistrust or conflict that will be relevant to the performance and evaluation of methods ( Kelly_and_Van_Vlaenderen,_1995_CITE)."
"If people come to an intervention with different purposes for engaging, then it is likely that different evaluation criteria will be important to them ( McAllister,_1999;_Murphy-Berman_et_al.,_2000;_Tuler_et_al.,_2005;_Rowe_and_Frewer,_2004;_Masozera_et_al.,_2006;_White,_2006_CITE)"
"While Rowe_and_Frewer_(2004)_CITE say that an appropriate response is to set aside the purposes and preferred criteria of diverse stakeholders in favour of a single criterion of acceptability of the method to all parties , more nuanced findings will be generated by evaluating the method against multiple criteria of relevance to different stakeholders ( Murphy-Berman_et_al.,_2000_CITE)."
"Even when an academic researcher makes a significant effort to be responsive to stakeholders, there may still be mistrust stemming from expectations of divergent purposes ( Adams_and_McCullough,_2003_CITE), and this may affect the evaluation of methods."
"The process of application of a method is important as well, not just the method as formally constructed ( Keys,_1994_CITE)"
"Compare, for example, two significantly different accounts of soft systems methodology (SSM): Checkland_and_Scholes_(1990)_CITE discuss how the methods from SSM should be utilised in a flexible and iterative manner, while Li_and_Zheng_(1995)_CITE insert some of the same methods into a general systems methodology"
"Mingers_(1997)_CITE describes these as the intellectual resources that the researcher brings into an intervention, and it is important to be able to distinguish whether problems encountered in the use of a method derive from the limitations of the method itself or from the inadequate resources of the researcher"
"Outcomes may also be longer term in nature, and these are not always predictable or easy to measure ( Duignan_and_Casswell,_1989_CITE)"
"It is generally accepted (eg, Cavana_et_al.,_2001_CITE) that a questionnaire to be employed in an experimental context should be tested for validity (does it measure what we think it does?) and reliability (does it give consistent results?)"
"However, for an evaluation questionnaire to be employed in the field outside the context of experimental studies, usability is just as important, if not more so ( Rowe_and_Frewer,_2004_CITE)"
"Rowe_and_Frewer_(2004)_CITE note that, because compromises have to be made in questionnaire design to ensure usability (eg, the questions need to be answerable in 5 10 minutes at the end of a gruelling day), usability is often inversely related to validity and reliability (both of which are enhanced by the generation of more rather than less data)"
"This may be the case but, as Rowe_et_al._(2005)_CITE say, there is no point even beginning to consider validity and reliability if the instrument cannot be used in the first place"
"facilitating consultation with land owners and community interest groups as part of a feasibility study for the construction of a new water storage dam ( Winstanley_et_al.,_2005_CITE)."
"working with an Australian NGO and its stakeholders in exploring policy options to address the public injecting of illicit drugs ( Midgley_et_al.,_2005_CITE);"
"facilitating workshops with the police and other stakeholders in the New Zealand criminal justice system to look at ethical issues associated with anticipated future developments of forensic DNA technologies ( Baker_et_al.,_2006_CITE);"
"reviewing the process used by the New Zealand Ministry of Research, Science and Technology to develop roadmaps for long-term investments in environment, energy, biotechnology and nanotechnology research ( Baker_and_Midgley,_2007_CITE); and"
"developing a new collaborative evaluation approach in partnership with regional council staff responsible for facilitating community engagement in sustainability initiatives ( Hepi_et_al.,_2008_CITE)."
"The second limitation we are aware of, applying to longer term comparisons of methods using the questionnaire, comes from the observation that there is a strong movement advocating methodological pluralism or multi-methodology (eg, Flood_and_Jackson,_1991;_Jackson,_1991,_2000;_Flood_and_Romm,_1996;_Mingers_and_Gill,_1997;_Midgley,_2000_CITE)"
"At its most flexible, a pluralist practice may involve the integration of several previously distinct methods into a new whole, perhaps also incorporating the design of novel elements ( Midgley,_2000_CITE)"
Rowe_et_al._(2005)_CITE discuss the substantial difficulties in doing this in the field because participants are often reluctant to fill in two or more questionnaires asking similar things (the usual approach to testing for validity being to compare with another questionnaire constructed for similar purposes)
"Indeed, in this case, testing for validity will be difficult because there are so few instruments available in the public domain (eg, Halvorsen,_2001_CITE), and those that exist are geared to evaluating forms of public participation other than the use of systemic PSMs"
"Clearly, the sheer amount of data created by mobile devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) [1]_CITE, and a myriad of other sources cannot be handled by traditional data processing approaches [2]_CITE"
"From the business perspective, the goal of these technologies is to process fast input streams, obtain real-time insights, and enable prompt reaction to them [4]_CITE."
Clouds are leveraged to provide the low latency and scalability needed by modern applications [5 7]_CITE
Other systems explore cloud computing to facilitate offering CEP functionalities in the services model [8]_CITE
"First, cloud environments are subject to variations that make it difficult to reproduce the environment and conditions of an experiment [9]_CITE"
"Early research into distributed systems [10]_CITE and grid computing [11]_CITE used simulators, as well as the more recent field of cloud computing [12 14]_CITE"
"CEP and SP technologies share related goals, as both are concerned with processing continuous data flows coming from distributed sources to obtain timely responses to queries [19]_CITE"
"This work uses a terminology based on the Event Processing Technical Society (EPTS) glossary [20]_CITE, which originated from the CEP literature"
These queries have usually been defined by means of proprietary languages such as Aurora Stream Query Algebra (SQuAl) [17]_CITE and CQL [21]_CITE.
"Despite standardization efforts [22]_CITE, a variety of languages are still in use today"
"Many authors have recognized the symbiotic relationship between these areas [23 25]_CITE, as cloud computing environments can be used to store and process Big Data and also to enable new models for data services"
"For instance, Chang and Wills [26]_CITE used a cloud platform to store big biomedical data, whereas Grolinger et al [27]_CITE proposed a platform for knowledge generation and access using cloud technologies."
"For instance, TimeStream [5]_CITE, StreamCloud [6]_CITE, and StreamHub [7]_CITE are CEP systems that use cloud infrastructures as their runtime environments."
"Similarly, the discussion around Big Data, and the rise of the MapReduce platform [28]_CITE, have also had a great impact on CEP"
"Other frameworks, such as Twitter Storm [31]_CITE and Yahoo S4 [32]_CITE, propose a more radical departure from the MapReduce programming model, but maintain runtime platforms inspired by MapReduce implementations."
"Simulators are a popular tool that has been used in Grid Computing research [11,33]_CITE for many years"
"More recently, the usage of simulators in the Cloud Computing field has also become widespread, which motivated the development of a number of simulators such as CloudSim [12]_CITE, GreenCloud [13]_CITE, and iCanCloud [14]_CITE"
"Because of its limitations, CloudSim has originated many extensions in the literature [9,34,35]_CITE"
"Finally, Grozev and Buyya [35]_CITE presented a model for three-tier Web applications and incorporated it into CloudSim"
"This is the case with Aurora [17]_CITE, StreamCloud [6]_CITE, Storm [31]_CITE, S4 [32]_CITE, FUGU [37]_CITE, and many others."
"Systems using declarative languages, on the other hand, create execution plans from queries that can often be mapped into DAGs [5,18]_CITE"
"Even for pattern-based query languages, previous studies [38]_CITE have shown that is possible to transform them into DAGs."
"For example, an Aurora filter is an operator that routes events to alternative outputs based on attribute values [17]_CITE"
"Defining placements for a set of queries is an instance of the operator placement problem, as defined by Lakshmanan et al [39]_CITE"
"A scheduling strategy can fundamentally determine the performance of a CEP system by optimizing for different aspects of the system, such as overall QoS [17]_CITE or memory consumption [40]_CITE"
"For instance, Aniello et al [43]_CITE proposed a scheduler that can be used to improve the system performance, and Chang et al [44]_CITE introduced CCAF, a security framework that can be used to secure Storm deployments."
"To do so, first a Storm cluster was created at the Amazon EC2 service [45]_CITE"

"Datta_et al._(2011b)_CITE, Bell_et al._(2013)_CITE and Pfeffermann_et al._(2014)_CITE studied the problem of benchmarking"
Ybarra_and_Lohr_(2008)_CITE proposed a new small area estimator that accounts for sampling variability in the auxiliary information
Herrador_et al._(2011)_CITE treated situations where small areas are divided into two groups and domain random effects have different variances across the groups
Slud_and_Maiti_(2011)_CITE were interested on small area estimation based on left censored survey data.
Fay_(1987)_CITE and Datta_et al._(1991)_CITE compared the precision of small area estimators obtained from univariate models for each response variable with the ones obtained by a multivariate model
Datta_et al._(1996)_CITE used also a multivariate Fay Herriot model for obtaining hierarchical Bayes estimates of median income of four-person families for the US states
Gonz lez-Manteiga_et al._(2008b)_CITE studied a class of multivariate Fay Herriot model with a common random effect for all the components of the target vector
This is a new and flexible class of multivariate models that does not contain the models of Gonz lez-Manteiga_et al._(2008b)_CITE as particular cases.
Choudry_and_Rao_(1989)_CITE introduced a model including several time instants and considering an autocorrelated structure for sampling errors
Rao_and_Yu_(1994)_CITE proposed a model that borrows information across areas and over time
Ghosh_et al._(1996)_CITE proposed a time correlated area level model to estimate the median income of four-person families for American states
"Datta_et al._(1999)_CITE, You_and_Rao_(2000)_CITE, Datta_et al._(2002)_CITE, Esteban_et al._(2011,_2012)_CITE, Marhuenda_et al._(2013)_CITE and Morales_et al._(2015)_CITE gave some extensions of the Rao Yu model with applications to the estimation of labor or poverty indicators"
Singh_et al._(2005)_CITE and Pfeffermann_and_Burck_(1990)_CITE considered models with time-varying random slopes obeying an autoregressive process
"Gonz lez-Manteiga_et al._(2008b)_CITE considered the linking model (2) d=xd +1Rvd,vd indN(0, v2),d=1, ,D, where 1n is the n 1 vector with all elements equal to 1"
"If (yd1, ,ydR) is a vector of direct estimators at time periods r=1, ,R and Ve is diagonal, then Model 2 can be written in the form of Esteban_et al._(2011)_CITE, ie ydr=xdr +udr+edr,d=1, ,D,r=1, ,R, where, for each domain d, the random effects {udr}r=1R are assumed to follow an AR(1) stochastic process and the random errors {edr}r=1R are i.i.d"
"However, the introduced class of multivariate Fay Herriot models does not contain the Rao_and_Yu_(1994)_CITE model or the Gonz lez-Manteiga_et al._(2008b)_CITE model as special cases."
"For Model 1, we propose the starting values r,0= ur,02,r=1, ,R, where ur,02 is the Prasad_and_Rao_(1990)_CITE moment-based estimator of ur2 in the rth marginal Fay Herriot model"
Prasad_and_Rao_(1990)_CITE gave an approximation to the MSE of the EBLUP of dr under the univariate Fay Herriot model when their proposed moment-based estimator of the variance ur2 is employed
"For the general linear model, Das_et al._(2004)_CITE derived the MSE of the EBLUP under REML and ML"
"Although, the multivariate Fay Herriot model (4) can be written in the form of the general linear mixed model considered by Das_et al._(2004)_CITE, the approximation of the matrix of mean squared crossed errors is not covered by this paper."
"Under the assumption of normality on u and e and for unbiased and translation invariant estimators of , Kackar_and_Harville_(1981)_CITE proved that the expectations of the last two terms in (12) are null"
They are the same bootstrap alternatives of Gonz lez-Manteiga_et al._(2008b)_CITE .
The target of Simulation 2 is to investigate the behavior of the MSE estimator (15) and the three bootstrap alternatives considered by Gonz lez-Manteiga_et al._(2008b)_CITE
Gonz lez-Manteiga_et al._(2008a)_CITE established the consistency of the MSE estimators under a multivariate Fay Herriot model
Marhuenda_et al._(2013)_CITE analyzed the behavior of msed1 under a spatio-temporal Fay Herriot model
Esteban_et al._(2012)_CITE and Marhuenda_et al._(2013)_CITE gave estimates of province poverty proportions and gaps by using data from the 2006 Spanish Living Condition Survey (SLCS)
Esteban_et al._(2012)_CITE studies several univariate extensions of the Fay Herriot model to temporal data
Datta_et al._(2002)_CITE considered current population survey (CPS) estimates of median income of four-person families for states of the US for nine years (1981 1989) to produce estimates for the year 1989
Recent attempts to raise the visibility of ethics in IS education point toward a perceived lack of relevant competence of IS graduates [1]_CITE.
"The term was chosen in explicit recognition of the long and continuing discussion of reference disciplines in IS [2 4]_CITE, where scholars recognize that the field of IS draws on prior and parallel scholarly activities"
"Furthermore, it has its historical roots in philosophy and computer science [5]_CITE."
"However, the point of this paper is not to discuss whether there is a cumulative body of knowledge that is sufficiently mature and accepted as the core of the IS discipline [6]_CITE"
"Willcocks [8]_CITE suggests a definition of information systems as [ .] those academics, researchers, teachers, students and indeed practitioners who gravitate around conferences such as ICIS, ECIS, HICSS, PACIS and AIS, tend to be members of the association for information systems or related/similar bodies, write research papers and books consciously within an IS discipline and publish in a self-defined group of IS journals [ ]"
"Much of the work undertaken in computer ethics is published in single authored [9]_CITE or edited volumes, such as [10 14]_CITE."
The history of some of the early members of this community and the interest in ethics and computing can be traced back further [5]_CITE
"Although these three ethical positions are an integral part of the theoretical composition of the field, it is important to note that they are sometimes adapted specifically to questions and applications concerning computing [20]_CITE"
"Information ethics, which has been promoted by, and is strongly linked to, Luciano Floridi work [12,27,28]_CITE, is an attempt to develop an ethical position on the basis of the ontological properties of information"
"Disclosive ethics, on the other hand, [29]_CITE is an approach that attempts to make explicit the ethical assumptions embedded in technologies"
"However, there has been a long tradition of research into ethical issues in organizations and societies, much of which touches on specific questions or problems raised by computing technology [35,36]_CITE"
"Computer ethics therefore draws on discussions in business ethics [37 39]_CITE and corporate social responsibility [40,41]_CITE."
"Brey and Soraker [43]_CITE identified a set of central issues of the field that they list as privacy, security, computer crime, intellectual property, free expression, and equity and access, and issues of responsibility and professional ethics"
"A recent attempt by the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies [44]_CITE to provide general guidance for European ICT researchers focuses on the fields of personal identity, changes to the social sphere, political participation and citizenship, and the sphere of e-commerce."
"However, there are a number of easily identifiable core issues worth listing because they have led to political debates in various countries [45]_CITE and are often examined by IS researchers"
"This is directly related, albeit not identical, to the question of data protection [48]_CITE."
"On the one hand, a feeling of security appears to be a necessity for human development and can therefore be argued to be of high ethical relevance [49]_CITE"
Security can be seen here as an ethically problematic mechanism of domination [50]_CITE.
"Questions of ethical and legal justification and protection can be traced back through the history of philosophy [51,52]_CITE"
"Digitizing content, such as books or movies, leads to new challenges that traditional property and intellectual property governance did not consider, notably, the negligible cost of reproducing content combined with the ease of copying leads to conceptual problems when applying traditional notions such as theft [53]_CITE"
"Computer ethics therefore has long engaged in debates about ethical issues related to access that is often framed in terms of digital divides [58,59]_CITE"
"An important aspect of this is the question of participation in public discourses and the influence that computing has on political processes and decision making [60]_CITE, which links to another well-established topic of computer ethics, namely that of freedom of speech"
"Again, this is a well-established topic of ethical reflection that takes on a new urgency because of the capability of computers to facilitate a simple and broad dissemination of ideas while simultaneously offering new ways of censoring and prosecuting unwanted contributions [61]_CITE."
"This covers new threats, such as identity theft, and more fundamental questions about the way we conceptualize humans and how modern technologies affect our individual and collective views of ourselves [42]_CITE"
"This covers topics such as the construction of gender [62]_CITE and the way we protect ourselves against crime as well as issues around what constitutes a good life and how we want to live it [20,63]_CITE"
"Philosophers have had long discussions of what is sometimes referred to as Hume law or Hume Guillotine [67]_CITE, which states that description cannot lead to prescriptive or normative statements"
"Examples of this are the development of a comprehensive ethics impact assessment [68]_CITE and technically addressing ethical issues in computing by, for example, developing ways of integrating values into technology through methods such as value-sensitive design [31,69,70]_CITE or privacy by design [71]_CITE"
"[72]_CITE) shows that theories, topics and approaches of computer ethics are all reflected in IS, albeit to different degrees"
In recent years there has been some interest in ethical theory and its relevance to Information Systems [73 76]_CITE
"Not only is it the first P in Mason PAPA acronym, it is also a recurring topic in numerous prominent early ethics-related IS papers, such as [78,79]_CITE"
The problematic relationship between privacy and security also finds its reflection in IS research [80]_CITE
"This interest in intellectual property is reflected in related investigations that touch on questions of ownership, such as open source software [81]_CITE, computer fraud [82]_CITE or perceptions of plagiarism [83]_CITE."
"At the same time, there is more of a focus on the ethical aspects of the use of computing technologies in IS [84]_CITE"
"As a result, there is a strong dominance of empirical research using the various paradigms, methods and methodologies that have been established in the field [85]_CITE."
"One can find reference to the convergence of nano, bio, information and cognitive technologies [87,88]_CITE"
It is likely that the distinction between computing and other technologies will be even less clearly defined in the future than it is in the present [89]_CITE.
Complaints about lack of relevance are not confined to computer ethics because the discussion in IS on the relationship of rigor versus relevance [92 94]_CITE demonstrates
"Nor is this concern particularly novel, which was noted by Gotterbarn 20 years ago [95]_CITE"
It is unclear whether established procedures of informed consent are applicable or whether they are principle conceivable [96]_CITE
"Originally aimed at preventing harm arising from research and innovation activities [98]_CITE, RRI has since broadened its objectives"
Its starting point is the dilemma that we may not know the future but that it seems likely that there are significant socio-economic and technical problems (often referred to as grand challenges [99]_CITE) that will require input from research and innovation systems if they are to be satisfactorily addressed [100]_CITE
"We have elsewhere [106]_CITE argued that RRI can be interpreted as a higher-level responsibility or meta-responsibility that aims to shape, maintain, develop, coordinate and align existing and novel research and innovation-related processes, actors and responsibilities with a view to ensuring desirable and acceptable research outcomes"
"Examples include various types of assessments, such as risk assessment and impact assessments [107,108]_CITE; technology assessment [109]_CITE; various types of research governance structures, such as research ethics reviews [110]_CITE and research integrity measures [111]_CITE; public engagement in research [112]_CITE; the education of researchers [98]_CITE; and the support for the development of professionalism [101]_CITE, to name just some of the more prominent assessments"
"It is worth noting here that RRI overlaps to a large degree with technology assessment, although RRI is broader and encompasses many of the ideas and principles that have been developed in technology assessment since the 1970s [113]_CITE."
"In view of the global nature of research and innovation systems as well as of the global challenges that humanity faces, the search for generally binding normative underpinnings is important [114]_CITE"
"Normative principles can furthermore be sought in philosophical ethics, with some scholars suggesting that there are generally accepted principles [86,115]_CITE that are sufficiently defined to provide the basis for collective action"
"The implementation of RRI activities through research governance measures can make use of widely shared principles of research governance, such as the integration of democratic principles into research [116]_CITE, the precautionary principle [117,118]_CITE or the principle of regulatory parsimony [116]_CITE."
"There are now examples of papers in IS that look at various grand challenges [126,127]_CITE"
An alternative way of framing this broader perspective has been suggested by Walsham [128]_CITE in considering whether IS research is creating a better world.
"Again, this is a stream of research that already exists [129]_CITE but would need to become more central to support the RRI agenda."
"However, it is worth noting that there is a long tradition of participative IS design [130,131]_CITE, particularly strong in Scandinavian IS [132]_CITE, which can serve as a bridgehead for a more general democratic and participative approach to IS governance"
"Much research has been undertaken in areas ranging from ethical theory [72]_CITE to future foresight [133,134]_CITE, to research governance [102]_CITE"
"In software project retrospectives, individuals work together in order to create an understanding of what worked well in the prior project, and what could be improved ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Root cause analysis (RCA) is used in software project retrospectives, which are recommended practice for example in the Scrum software development method ( Schwaber_and_Sutherland,_2011_CITE)"
"RCA helps in capturing the lessons learned from individuals ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE) and aims to state what the perceived problem causes are and where they occur ( Lehtinen_and_M ntyl ,_2011;_Lehtinen_et_al.,_2014a_CITE)"
"Furthermore, RCA can be a part of project retrospectives, but it can also be a part of continuous software process optimization as recommended by the CMMI model ( Software_Engineering_Institute_CITE)."
"A cause effect diagram (CED) is a commonly recommended technique for RCA ( Anbari_et_al.,_2008;_Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009;_Dings yr,_2005;_Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"In our previous work, we operated with software organizations that have used textual notations to document the retrospectives instead of CEDs ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011,_CITE 2014b_CITE)"
"Birk_et_al._(2002)_CITE stated that software project retrospectives provide an excellent method for knowledge management , due to the high feasibility for continuous improvement and corrective action development"
"The objective of retrospectives is to help individuals, teams, and organizations to learn from the past ( Dyb _et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"This objective is fulfilled by sharing the lessons learned on the successful and unsuccessful events ( Collier_et_al.,_1996_CITE) over the members of software project organization ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2014b_CITE)"
"Such knowledge sharing increases the organizational knowledge ( Boh_et_al.,_2007_CITE), which in turn, becomes useful for software process improvement activities."
"It also helps to express how the underlying causes are related to one another ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2014a_CITE)"
"St lhane_et_al._(2003)_CITE presented that such an approach is feasible for software organizations, because it 1) improves the documentation of knowledge, 2) improves the development of improvement actions, and 3) provides a good starting point for systematic knowledge harvesting"
"Card_(1998)_CITE showed significant evidence on the high efficiency of using RCA in software project retrospectives, ie, a 50% decrease in the defect rates during the two years of observations"
"Our prior studies ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2014b,_CITE 2011_CITE) showed that RCA is also perceived as cost-efficient and easy-to-use by the retrospective participants"
"Furthermore, in a retrospective study comparing the causes of software project failures and successes, Mol kken- stvold_and_J rgensen_(2005)_CITE indicate that the underlying factors of the success and failure are actually mirroring one another"
"First, the team members list and select success factors and problems occurred during the project or milestone ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"It is important to focus on actions that truly have occurred, otherwise the retrospective becomes an emotional vending sessions ( Bjarnason_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Thereafter, the selected findings are further analyzed by the team members using RCA ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"The team members conduct RCA by constantly asking why? for every cause detected ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE), eg, by using Five Whys technique ( Andersen_and_Fagerhaug,_2006_CITE)"
"While the causes are detected, they are also organized into CED ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE), an external representation of the RCA outcome"
"The ultimate output of RCA is the causal structure of events explaining why they occurred ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2014a;_St lhane_et_al.,_2003_CITE)."
"Glass_(2002)_CITE explained that this is because of too busy software teams, lack of retrospective timing, and lack of methodological support"
"In prior studies, software project retrospectives have been introduced as synchronous face-to-face meetings ( Dings yr_et_al.,_2001_CITE; Dings yr,_2005_CITE), but today's company practices favor distributed settings ( Terzakis,_2011_CITE)"
"Similarly, even though the use of CED has been introduced as an important part of retrospectives ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE), the company practices seem to favor textual notations to visualize the retrospective findings ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011,_CITE 2014b_CITE)"
"Software tool support for collaborative cause effect diagramming is also widely missing ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2014b_CITE) and therefore using CEDs in the distributed settings is practically challenging"
"The prior studies indicate that the external representation of knowledge impacts to the learning efficiency ( Mayer_and_Gallini,_1990;_Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003_CITE) and software project retrospective outcome ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Externalizing the tacit knowledge of individuals becomes important in retrospectives, because it enables organizational learning ( Dings yr,_2005_CITE)"
"The external representation is needed in order to control the problems of human memory ( Von_Zedtwitz,_2002;_Siau,_2004_CITE)"
"The external representation affects to the learning efficiency of individuals through self-explanation ( Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003_CITE)"
"Vessey_(1991)_CITE stated that problem presentation and problem solving task strive the individuals to create mental models of problems, important for problem solution"
"Self-explanation has been recognized as a key mechanism for learning from problems ( Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003_CITE)"
"It is about developing deeper understanding of material by explaining the material whilst studying it ( Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003_CITE)"
"These are Search , Recognition , and Inference ( Larkin_and_Simon,_1987_CITE)"
"The prior studies indicate that the information encoding techniques are different and human mind also processes the different types of encodings differently ( Moody,_2009_CITE)"
"For example, Larkin_and_Simon_(1987)_CITE claimed that in comparison with textual notations a diagrammatic representation provides a smooth traversal between the pieces of knowledge, which is important for problem solving."
"The representation techniques differ in terms of the expertise that is required to interpret the registered information ( Moody,_2009_CITE)"
"The prior studies claim that, in comparison with textual notations, extra training could be needed to interpret informationally equivalent diagrammatic representation ( Ottensooser_et_al.,_2012;_Moody,_2009;_Larkin_and_Simon,_1987_CITE)"
"It follows that the retrospective participants remain unable to recognize the relevant information from the external representation ( Larkin_and_Simon,_1987_CITE)."
"Regarding the Inference, the prior studies indicate that an effective external representation presents a cause-and-effect system , which helps the learner to create a runnable mental model of the system ( Mayer_and_Gallini,_1990_CITE)"
"Prior studies have claimed that a diagram representation increases the self-explanation efficiency ( Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003_CITE) and learning efficiency ( Mayer_and_Gallini,_1990_CITE)"
"The use of diagram notations has been claimed to increase significantly the efficiency of self-explanation when compared with textual notations ( Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003_CITE)"
"Various techniques to draw CED are introduced, eg, a fishbone diagram ( Burnstein,_2003;_Stevenson,_2005;_Andersen_and_Fagerhaug,_2006;_Ishikawa,_1990_CITE), a fault tree diagram ( Andersen_and_Fagerhaug,_2006_CITE), a directed graph ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE), a matrix diagram ( Nakashima_et_al.,_1999_CITE), a scatter chart ( Andersen_and_Fagerhaug,_2006_CITE), a logic tree ( Latino_and_Latino,_2006_CITE), and a causal factor chart ( Rooney_and_Vanden_Heuvel,_2004_CITE)"
"These include the fishbone diagram ( Burnstein,_2003;_Andersen_and_Fagerhaug,_2006;_Stevenson,_2005;_Bj rnson,_Wang,_and_Arisholm,_2009;_St lhane,_2004;_St lhane_et_al.,_2003_CITE) and directed graph ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009;_Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011,_2014b_CITE)"
"The fishbone diagram applies a tree structure where the causes of problems are organized into some premade classes of causes ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Instead, the directed graph applies a network structure where the causes of problems are organized solely based on their cause and effect relationships ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
Bj rnson_et_al._(2009)_CITE compared the use of the fishbone diagram with the directed graph in software project retrospectives
"The comparison also revealed that the directed graph improves the analysis by increasing the number of hubs, which are defined as causes that are related to more than one problem ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"The increasing number of hubs indicates improvement in the Inference factor ( Mayer_and_Gallini,_1990_CITE)"
"The strict hierarchical manner and weak layout of the fishbone diagram are its main weaknesses ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"The tree structure enforces duplicating the same cause under many problems whereas in the network structure only references to the problems are duplicated ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
Ammerman_(1998)_CITE presented a technique for RCA called Causal Factor List
"Drawing CED requires writing down cause statements with graphical nodes and edges to interconnect the detected causes ( Dings yr_et_al.,_2001_CITE)"
"Additionally, making a structural list of causes does not require specific software tools for RCA as it is with CEDs ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011,_CITE 2014b_CITE)."
"In our prior study ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE), we criticized the feasibility of using the structural list technique in RCA"
"This means that when using the structural list in RCA, writing down the causes more than once increases the workload ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"The prior studies on cognitive psychology and human factors ( Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003;_Larkin_and_Simon,_1987_CITE) indicate that use of diagrams could improve the efficiency of learning in software project retrospectives"
"Instead, the prior studies have indicated that the effectiveness of RCA is dependent on the technique used to visualize the causes of problems ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE; Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Comparison to structural lists is important as they are the most straightforward to use and they are used in industry ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011,_2014b_CITE)."
"Therefore, they neither require specific software tools ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011,_2014b_CITE)"
The results of Ottensooser_et_al._(2012)_CITE who compared the use of textual and graphical notations for interpreting business process descriptions support this idea
"The prior studies on organizational learning systems and cognitive maps support this view ( Lee_et_al.,_1992_CITE)"
"Finally, the evaluation needs to be done in the actual software project retrospective context, because different representations of information are suitable for different tasks and different audiences ( Moody,_2009_CITE)."
"In this section, we introduce the research goals and present how the research data was collected and analyzed in this controlled experiment ( Juristo_and_Moreno,_2003_CITE)"
"Our objective is to compare two cause and effect structuring techniques used in software project retrospectives: 1) a directed graph ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE; Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE), and 2) a structural list ( Ammerman,_1998_CITE)"
"The directed graph has been presented as the most optimal CED technique in the RCA of software project retrospectives ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE; Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)."
"Since the early 1980s, Aalto University has provided a capstone project course for computer science students ( Vanhanen_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"The teams are required to follow a process framework defined by the course ( Vanhanen_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"The use of students as study subjects has been discussed in the software engineering literature (eg, Svahnberg_et_al.,_2008_CITE; Berander,_2004;_Carver_et_al.,_2003;_Runeson,_2003_CITE; H st_et_al.,_2000_CITE)"
"Runeson_(2003)_CITE discussed the difference of using freshmen students, graduate level students, and industry personnel as study subjects"
"The conclusions are that graduate level students are feasible subjects for revealing improvement trends, but infeasible to reveal the absolute levels of improvements ( Runeson,_2003_CITE)"
Berander_(2004)_CITE explained that the applicability of using students as study subjects is dependent on their experience and commitment
"He also claims that the use of students as representatives for professionals is more appropriate in software projects than classroom settings ( Berander,_2004_CITE)"
Similar conclusions are also given by Carver_et_al._(2003)_CITE.
"Additionally, similar research context has been previously used to conduct somewhat similar comparison ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE)."
"The experiment followed a single factor paired design with a single blocking variable ( Juristo_and_Moreno,_2003_CITE)"
"Finally, a hub cause ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE) refers to a cause that creates more than one effect and a single cause refers to a cause that creates exactly one effect."
"It indicates how actively the participants presented their visions about the software project, one of the key requirements for a successful retrospective meeting and organizational learning ( Dings yr,_2005_CITE)"
"It has been claimed that the number of detected causes also indicates the effectiveness of the RCA method ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"We use two response variables related to the causal structure, proposed by Bj rnson_et_al._(2009)_CITE, the size of depth level (SoDL) and the proportion of hub causes (PoH) (see Fig_4)"
"This hypothesis was based on our prior experiences on the output of RCA in industrial software project context ( Lehtinen_and_M ntyl ,_2011_CITE)"
"In RCA, the detection of causes starts by the detection of few first level causes ( Andersen_and_Fagerhaug,_2006_CITE), which thereafter evolve to the detection of higher level causes ( Andersen_and_Fagerhaug,_2006_CITE) resulting in increasing number of detected problems and causes at the higher depth levels"
"In contrast to the structural list, CED uses graphical nodes and edges (see Fig_1) helping the participants to remember ( Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003_CITE) and focus on ( Larkin_and_Simon,_1987_CITE) the detected causes"
"The prior studies support this hypothesis as they have indicated improvements in the self-explanation efficiency ( Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003_CITE) and Inference ( Larkin_and_Simon,_1987_CITE) while a diagram representation has been compared with a textual representation"
"There is simply less distraction in the causal structure when CED is used and the structure is also visual making it easier to remember ( Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003_CITE)"
"This was important as the problems related to software projects and the number and characteristics of their underlying causes vary ( Lehtinen_and_M ntyl ,_2011_CITE)"
"We controlled this issue by forcing each team to analyze a common endemic problem that occurs frequently during the projects, ie why it is challenging to reach the project goals ( Vanhanen_et_al.,_2012_CITE)."
"We decided that each retrospective has to include at least four to seven participants, as suggested in Lehtinen_et_al._(2011)_CITE"
"As a summary, the data collection was based on triangulation which increases the validity of the study results ( Yin,_1994;_Runeson_and_H st,_2008;_Jick,_1979_CITE)"
"Furthermore, we evaluated the standardized effect size for the systematic differences between the treatments by using Cohen's_d_(1988)_CITE"
"The effect size results were interpreted in the following way: d < 0.2 (small), d 0.5 (medium), and d > 0.8 (large) ( Cohen,_1988_CITE)"
"The following pattern was used to calculate Cohen's d, where X is the sample mean, n is the sample size, and is the standard deviation ( Kampenes_et_al.,_2007_CITE): Cohen sd=X1 X2(n1s12+n2s22)(n1+n2)"
"We classified the detected causes by using a classification system developed for analyzing the characteristics of the causes of software project problems introduced in our prior studies ( Lehtinen_and_M ntyl ,_2011;_Lehtinen_et_al.,_2014a_CITE)"
"Open coding technique ( Flick,_2006_CITE) was used to analyze how the participants described the treatments"
"As suggested in Flick_(2006)_CITE, we started the qualitative analysis by recognizing the units of meaning , ie concepts that reflected the reasoning given in the comments (single words and short sentences of words from the comments)"
"The comments were classified line-by-line to the concepts we recognized, as recommended in Flick_(2006)_CITE"
"In order to compare the comments on a more abstract level, we continued the analysis procedure by recognizing categories that linked the concepts together ( Flick,_2006_CITE)"
"Respectively, both treatments resulted in active retrospective meetings, where the participants eagerly presented and shared their visions about the software project, which is important for retrospectives ( Dings yr,_2005_CITE)"
"The finding consolidates the experimentation results of Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou_(2003)_CITE who presented that the use of diagrams encourages individuals to create mental images on the cause and effect relationships, which helps them to explain the studied system of knowledge as a whole, increasing the efficiency of learning."
"Our research in industrial context has identified such ability as very important for understanding the causes of software project failures ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2014a_CITE), which represent complex software engineering problems that cannot be solved by considering the shallow causes only."
"The structural list was also described as easier to operate due to its high readability, as indicated by Ottensooser_et_al._(2012)_CITE"
Moody_(2009)_CITE stated that different representations of information are suitable for different tasks and audiences
"Based on prior studies ( McLeod_and_MacDonell,_2011_CITE), software project problems are complex and they are often related to many causes"
"Respectively, the positive effect of CED for learning has been determined especially with complex problems ( Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003_CITE)"
Similar conclusion has been given by Bj rnson_et_al._(2009)_CITE
"Such ability has been related to CED also in a prior study ( Larkin_and_Simon,_1987_CITE)"
"Lee_et_al._(1992)_CITE claimed that sharing cognitive maps, which include perceived cause and effect relationships between actions and their responses, results in organizational learning"
"Our results indicate that the use of CED helps in creating linkages between the causes of problems, which has been claimed to be the key for self-explanation efficiency ( Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003_CITE)"
"This finding indicates that the use of CED brings additional value to the retrospectives, which consolidates the prior studies recommending using CEDs in the RCA of retrospectives ( Anbari_et_al.,_2008_CITE; Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE; Dings yr,_2005_CITE; Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Recently, Bjarnason_et_al._(2014)_CITE presented a timeline approach to conduct retrospectives"
"In comparison with textual representation, diagram representation could be easier to remember ( Ainsworth_and_Th_Loizou,_2003;_Larkin_and_Simon,_1987_CITE) and therefore it becomes more optimal for knowledge sharing."
"Considering alternative techniques to create CED ( Burnstein,_2003;_Stevenson,_2005;_Andersen_and_Fagerhaug,_2006;_Ishikawa,_1990;_Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009;_Nakashima_et_al.,_1999;_Latino_and_Latino,_2006;_Ammerman,_1998;_Andersen_and_Fagerhaug,_2006;_Rooney_and_Vanden_Heuvel,_2004_CITE), it seems evitable that in software project retrospectives the diagramming technique should support network structures ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"This is because of the hub causes ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE) (in our study their proportion was 7.5% as an average)"
"The fishbone diagram includes the same problem, as it is a tree structure ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)."
Bj rnsson_et_al._(2009)_CITE compared two CED techniques with a controlled student experiment and showed that using the fishbone diagram in RCA resulted in lower number of detected causes when compared with the directed graph
"We had a similar finding about the structural list, but the difference in the number of detected causes was not as large as was reported by Bj rnsson_et_al._(2009)_CITE"
Bj rnsson_et_al._(2009)_CITE assumed that the difference might have been smaller if they had used professional facilitators
"The method that we used did not change between the treatments, whereas the prior experiment used a nominal brainstorming technique with the directed graph and an interactive technique with the fishbone diagram ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Furthermore, in contrast to the structural list technique, the fishbone diagram steers the participants to classify the detected causes during the analysis ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Such a categorization is also known as modularization ( Moody,_2009_CITE), used to manage the complexity of raw data"
"On the other hand, modularization likely becomes highly important if the retrospective findings are communicated for other people (eg, Lehtinen_et_al.,_2014a_CITE)."
"These hypotheses are in line with the prior studies which have recommended using CEDs in the RCA of software project retrospectives ( Anbari_et_al.,_2008_CITE; Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE; Dings yr,_2005_CITE; Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Construct validity reflects the extent to which the studied operational measures really represent what is investigated according to the research questions ( Runeson_and_H st,_2008_CITE)"
"Internal validity is of concern when the causal relations of the measured factors are examined ( Runeson_and_H st,_2008_CITE)"
"External validity is concerned with whether it is possible to generalize the findings of the study and to what extent they can be generalized ( Runeson_and_H st,_2008_CITE)"
"Our results cannot be used to present the absolute level of improvements, but we believe they are valid for representing the improvement trend over the treatments ( Runeson,_2003_CITE)"
"Our results are also limited to retrospectives where only negative project experiences are analyzed, whereas the prior study considered also positive experiences ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"In industrial software teams, the number of causes could easily be over a hundred ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"We conducted somewhat similar retrospectives to CED in four software companies covering the work of over 100 employees in each company ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Respectively, our recent study with industrial software teams has consolidated this assumption by indicating that the motivation of the teams to conduct retrospectives increase while CED is used instead of writing down structural lists about the problems and their causes ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2014b_CITE)."
"A similar conclusion about the RCA method which utilizes CED has been presented ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE, 2014b;_Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"It has also been claimed that the flexible structure of CED is one of its advantages ( Bj rnson_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Reliability is concerned with the extent to which the data and analysis are dependent on a specific researcher ( Runeson_and_H st,_2008_CITE)"
"CED is a commonly recommended technique for RCA, as indicated in our earlier literature review ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Obviously, software companies rarely have time to conduct retrospectives ( Glass,_2002_CITE)"
"For example, software tools that support conducting RCA in distributed retrospectives are scarce ( Lehtinen_et_al.,_2014b_CITE)."
Uncertainties in these factors propagate to a larger scale and are reflected in variability of the stiffness and strength that characterise the overall structural behaviour [1 7]_CITE
"Consequently, high safety factors of the order of 8 10 [8]_CITE are introduced in current deterministic based structural design, thereby not taking full advantage of composite materials"
"These issues may be addressed in a probability based design context [9 11]_CITE equivalent to Eurocode, for example."
The reliability analysis of composites involves several key issues [13 15]_CITE
"First, many parameters may need to be considered as random variables, but they can be associated with different length scales: micro-scale (constituent level, fibre/matrix), meso-scale (ply level), or macro-scale (component level) [16]_CITE"
"Second, composite materials display a wide variety of failure mechanisms due to their complex structure and manufacturing process, and a range of failure criteria have been proposed, such as maximum stress/strain criteria and polynomial criteria (for instance, Tsai Wu criteria [17]_CITE)"
"Qualitative evaluations [13,21,22]_CITE, quantitative experimental comparisons [23]_CITE, and numerical comparisons [24]_CITE have been made for deterministic failure criteria and quantitative comparison of their performance considering uncertainty was reported in [25]_CITE, with broad differences"
"Third, for some relatively simple composite structures, analytical formulations have been developed [26 28]_CITE, while finite element reliability analysis methods are necessary to handle more complex structures [29]_CITE"
"The accuracy of MCS directly depends on the number of simulations, and it is recommended to conduct at least N simulations [31]_CITE, where N= ln(1 C)/pf with pf is the expected failure probability and C is a given confidence level (normally 95%), to obtain a sufficiently accurate estimate of pf"
"Recently, new reliability methods have been adopted or proposed to conduct reliability analyses for composite structures, such as Artificial Neuronal Networks [32,33]_CITE"
"Nakayasu et al, [25,34]_CITE compared different structural reliability analysis methods for composites and stated a preference of the FORM method."
"According to the perturbation method [51]_CITE, an arbitrary stochastic function, ( b), can be approximated via a Taylor series expansion"
"Although the general form of the perturbation-based stochastic finite element method enables higher-order approximations to be assumed, as proposed in [52,53]_CITE, the commonly used second-order approximation is sufficient for the present study"
"The three classic boundary conditions are linear displacement, periodic displacement and anti-periodic traction, and constant tractions, the details of which are given in [42]_CITE"
"The procedure is applicable to other failure criteria, for instance, six widely used failure criteria were compared in [39]_CITE on the performance of evaluating reliability of laminated composites by using the multi-scale finite element reliability approaches developed in the present paper"
"[54]_CITE attempted to establish a relationship by using micromechanics, whereby the asymptotic relationship is derived as (28)S232= T22C22where has some specific non-dimensional value that is to be determined from (29) =(1 )24(1 T22C22 )(1 C22T22 )where is given by (30) = (1+ )(1 )+(1+ )2(1 )2+(1 2 )2 (1+ )(1 )+(1+ )2(1 )2+(1 2 )2 with is the matrix material Poisson ratio, and =T/C with T and C the tensile and compressive strength of the isotropic matrix material, respectively."
"In the present study, this method is implemented in MoFEM (mesh-oriented finite element method) program [55]_CITE and the primary random variables are sampled according to their probabilistic features by a random number generator"
"Importance sampling may be used to reduce the number of required samples, but this requires careful selection of the distributions used to create realisations around the failure point [56]_CITE"
The details of these two transformation methods can be easily found in the textbook such as [56]_CITE.
"The limit state surface is adopted by a rotational parabolic surface of diameter 2 R, where R is the average principal curvature radius expressed as: (39)R=n 1 Swhere S is the sum of the principal curvatures of the limit state surfaces at the design point, which can be expressed as: (40) S= j=1nH jj TH By doing so, the performance functions in y-space, can be expressed simply as: (41)G(y)= (yn F)+12R j=1n 1yj2 [60]_CITE used Eq (41) as the basis to derive the empirical second-order reliability index as follows: (42) S={ 1[ ( F)(1+ ( F)R ( F)) n 12(1+2 S10(1+2 F))], S 0,(1+2.5 S2n 5R+25(23 5 F)/R2) F+12 S(1+ S40), S<0."
"A quasi-isotropic (90 / 45 /0 ) AS4/3502 laminated plate used in the WWFE-I is considered in this example as it is an important class of composites, familiar to the aerospace industry [63]_CITE"
"The geometric features of this laminate are shown in Fig_4 a, and the total thickness of the laminate is 1.1 mm with all layers having identical thickness [63]_CITE"
"Glass fibre reinforced polymer composite is an important material class in engineering applications, such as civil engineering [64]_CITE, due to their relatively low cost"
A laminate made of E-glass/LY 556 epoxy studied in WWFE-I [18]_CITE is considered in this section
"The layer orientation of this laminate is illustrated in Fig_6 a, and the total thickness of the laminate is 2 mm with the 30 layers having 82.8% of the total thickness of the laminate and the 90 plies having the rest 17.2% [63]_CITE"
Eurocontrol_(2013_CITE) has proposed different scenarios for predicting the number of flights in the coming years
"In an effort to work toward this harmonization, several practice guidelines have been published by different organizations, such as Frontex (technical and operational) ( Frontex,_2012a_CITE), International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO,_2015_CITE), the International Air Transport Association ( IATA,_2016_CITE), and the European Committee for Standardization ( CEN,_2015_CITE)"
"A TCN is any person who is not an EU citizen within the meaning of Article 20(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( European_Commission,_2008_CITE) and who is not a person enjoying the EU right to freedom of movement, as defined in Article 2(5) of the Schengen Borders Code"
"In the case where a face modality verification falls in an uncertainty score zone between the lower and upper thresholds, travelers are required to present their fingerprints for additional verification ( Cantarero_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"They can be classified as electronic passports (e-passports) ( ICAO,_2006a_CITE), Schengen visas ( ICAO,_2015;_Visa,_2007 2016_CITE), national ID cards ( BSI,_2011;_ICAO,_2011_CITE), and residence permits ( BSI,_2011_CITE)"
ICAO_(2014a_CITE) has already defined the characteristics of the e-reader
"Depending on the travelers category, which in the near future will be checked in either the RTP or EES ( PWC,_2014_CITE), and the security authentication protocols, different e-passports are used by travelers of different nationalities"
"Standard ICAO compliant second generation passports of ID-3 size are defined in ICAO Document 9303, part one ( ICAO,_2006a,_2006b_CITE)"
"For e-passports of Schengen member states, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) specification TR-03110, parts 1 and 3 ( BSI,_2012,_2013_CITE) are also applicable for the definition of Extended Access Control (EAC)"
"Future third generation passports will have a new security mechanism, Supplemental Access Control (SAC), as specified in ICAO_(2010_CITE)"
"BAC will still be supported for global interoperability and backward compatibility reasons and the two security mechanisms, BAC and SAC, will coexist for some time ( Gemalto,_2011_CITE)."
"It applies to an RTP and the Visa Information System (VIS) ( European_Commission,_2016_CITE)"
"They should follow the ISO/IEC 19794-5 constraints for facial images ( ISO/IEC,_2004_CITE)"
"The operational and technical recommendations required to meet these constraints should be followed by travelers during the photo capture ( ICAO,_2010_CITE) process; for example, regarding operational issues they should look straight into the camera keeping a neutral pose with both eyes visible; regarding technical issues, the parameters of the camera should ensure the provision of face images within a broad range of contrasts; there should be at least 90 pixels between the centers of the eyes in facial images provided by the face image capture unit ( Frontex,_2010_CITE); the face image capture unit should give the traveler feedback on his/her expected action; the angle covered by the cameras should be less than 45 degrees with respect to the traveler walk flow; the cameras resolution should be of at least 2 megapixels, and they should have short fields of view and frame rates of at least of 10 frames per second; image formats used, such as BMP, JPEG, JPEG 2000, and PNG, should have a storage compression of 24 bits/pixel, and, based on resolution, in face images there should be at least 90 pixels between the centers of the eyes"
"ISO/IEC 19794-5 ( ISO/IEC,_2004_CITE) gives guidelines for image quality analysis"
"Following best practical technical guidelines for ABC systems, the false accept rate (FAR) for facial capture and verification should be less than 0.1% and using this configuration the false rejection rate (FRR) should be less than 5% ( CEN,_2015;_Frontex,_2012a;_ICAO,_2014b_CITE)"
"As stated above, these recommendations suggest several constraints regarding the face image quality required at ABC e-gates when second generation passports are used ( S nchez_del_Rio_et al.,_2015_CITE)"
"These constraints are in the scenery and in the photographic and digital requirements ( Frontex,_2010;_ISO/IEC,_2004_CITE)"
"The best practices toward interoperable biometrics standards can be read in two important sources, the ICAO ( ICAO,_2014b_CITE) and the Frontex Research and Development Unit ( Frontex,_2012a_CITE)"
"Besides the aforementioned organizations, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is also contributing to interoperable standards in the use of biometric information ( Romine,_2013_CITE)."
"To conclude this introduction to ABC and face recognition systems, several European projects ( Berglund_and_Karbauskaite,_2008_CITE) related to ABC e-gates, funded by the EU and with the aim of achieving harmonization of the current and near future growing traveler flow, are now described"
"Most of these involve EU passport model biometric data with the objectives of preventing the illegal entry of travelers into a specific country, limiting the use of fraudulent documents, and making the border control more efficient ( Kosmerlj_et al.,_2006_CITE)"
"Another FP7 project is the ABC4EU project ( ABC4EU,_2014_CITE), the primary aim of which is to make border control more flexible by enhancing the workflow and harmonizing the functionalities of ABC e-gates"
"A project that is still active today is Automatic Recognition of Passengers with Credentials (RAPID) ( Frontex,_2010_CITE), which was launched by the Portuguese authorities to facilitate the increasing flow of passengers at airports, enhance their service levels (speed and convenience), save personnel resources, and reduce costs"
"The European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-scale Information Technology Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice (EU-LISA) ( Eu-LISA,_2016_CITE) was founded in 2011 through Regulation (EU) No"
"These systems, such as the Schengen Information System (SIS), the Visa Information System (VIS), and EURODAC ( Council_of_the_European_Union,_2000_CITE), assure travelers' protection and the exchange of information between national authorities"
Kosmerlj_et al._(2006_CITE) conducted an experiment to evaluate the operation of face recognition systems in large scale applications
Spreeuwers_et al._(2012_CITE) evaluated the automated facial recognition reliability for automatic border passage in two gates at Schiphol Airport

"In Beom-seok_and_Kar-ann_(2013_CITE), a technique for face feature extraction using sinusoidal projection was used"
"In Hwang_et al._(2011_CITE), a face recognition system using the extended curvature Gabor classifier bunch with the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) version 2.0, XM2VTS, BANCA, and PIE databases was described"

"In Duta_et al._(2012_CITE), the effects of a difference in pose between the test and reference images together with performance degradation caused by image quality factors, such as illumination, resolution, noise, blur, and Gaussian noise, were studied"
"In Er_et al._(2005_CITE), the discrete cosine transform (DCT) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the original facial image"
Another study that focused on the non-ideality of expression was presented in Zhang_et al._(2008_CITE)
"For example, in Chen_et al._(2000_CITE) a probability approach was proposed for analytically determining a probability distribution for the image gradient, which is dependent on the surface geometry and reflectance"
Other examples of this non-ideality were studied using the Harvard face database in Belhumeur_and_Kriegman_(1996_CITE)

"The effects of a mix of different non-idealities, such as orientation, scale, facial expression, and occlusions, were described by Lai_et al._(2001_CITE)"
"For improving recognition in scenarios where a combination of several non-idealities, such as lighting, expressions, pose, scale, and occlusions, are present, a method based on PCA, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), and LDA approaches was described in Wang_and_Liu_(2015_CITE)"
"Non-idealities, such as changes in uniform illumination and local appearances changes, eg, facial expression, pose, and occlusion, were addressed in Chen_et al._(2015_CITE)"
"To examine this, an experiment involving the recognition of participants in a conference was conducted in Zhao_et al._(2015_CITE) and its results are applicable to conference socialization scenarios"
"In Kaur_and_Himanshi_(2015_CITE), a method for facial recognition based on PCA was proposed"
"This non-ideality, in which only some colors are used for face recognition, sometimes as a result of the hardware employed, was addressed in Xiang_et al._(2015_CITE)"
"In Table 2, the systems in the studies ( Cantarero_et al.,_2013;_Conde_et al.,_2011;_Kosmerlj_et al.,_2006;_Kwon_and_Moon,_2008;_Spreeuwers_et al.,_2012;_Frontex,_2010_CITE) are evaluated"

"In Kwon_and_Moon_(2008_CITE), a face identification system with cryptographic mechanisms based on the current Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that is compatible with ICAO's Public Key Directory (PKD) was used for border control applications"

"As mentioned in section 2, in Conde_et al._(2011_CITE) an evaluation of the results obtained for a face recognition system in a real uncontrolled localization, such as Barajas Airport, was presented"
"In this Table 2 the works ( Bourlai_et al.,_2009;_Kim,_2005;_Kim_and_Kim,_2008;_Kumar_et al.,_2009;_Karthikeyan_et al.,_2013_CITE) are evaluated as well"

"In Karthikeyan_et al._(2013_CITE), a face verification system operating with the FRGC dataset, which comprises 3D scans and high resolution still images taken under controlled and uncontrolled conditions, was presented"
"Furthermore, the evaluation of the applicability of the system is lower than that of the system in Kumar_et al._(2009_CITE), because 3D scanners are not used in current ABC systems"
"The works ( Beom-seok_and_Kar-ann,_2013;_Hwang_et al.,_2011;_Li_et al.,_2013;_Manjupriya_et al.,_2013;_Zafeiriou_et al.,_2013_CITE) and the general situation of current ABC systems are evaluated in this table as well"

"The approach that was followed for measuring the execution time between different points of the ABC process was similar to the work developed in the FastPass project ( FastPass,_2016_CITE)"
"This value was calculated as the average time for 100 people and is in agreement with Frontex recommended efficiency ( Frontex,_2012a_CITE)"
"Considering these strong restrictions, we present a comparison of these results with the work described in Oostveen_et al._(2014_CITE), which is one of several studies carried out as part of the FastPass project and is based on ABC systems"
"Considering ABC system accuracy, some public results of different ABC approaches are reported in the literature, such as in the Frontex workshop, 1st Global Conference and Exhibition on Future developments on Automated Border Control, held in Warsaw in 2012 ( Frontex,_2012b_CITE)"
"Other ABC performance data available were presented in 2013 at the Frontex 2nd Global Conference and Exhibition on Future developments on Automated Border Control, held in Warsaw and organized by the Immigration and Border Service of Portugal ( Frontex,_2013_CITE)"
"Finally, other ABC performance values can be found in the different documents written for the FastPass project, such as in Opitz_and_Kriechbaum-Zabini_CITE"
"Researchers working on advanced recognition models are continuously searching a universal invariance to non-idealities so that systems are not affected by subjects wearing glasses or changes in rotation, translation, pose, expression, lighting ( Martinez,_2002;_Zhang_and_Gao,_2009;_Zou_et al.,_2007_CITE), etc"
"Multispectral image capture ( Chen_et al.,_2003;_Pan_et al.,_2003_CITE) will be used to capture 3D face images and detect features."
"Structures, such as pavements and rail tracks, built on continuous foundation soil are commonly idealized as beam-soil systems to study the behavior of foundation soil and stresses within the structures [1 6]_CITE"
"For the foundation soil, Winkler [1]_CITE proposed a spring analogy method named Winkler model to simulate the foundation soil"
"Recently, some scholars proposed new FSDTs for laminated composite plates and beams [10 11]_CITE"
A number of scholars have used different models to simulate the behavior of reinforced granular fill [19 22]_CITE
"Yin [23]_CITE developed a nonlinear constitutive model for granular fill to represent the nonlinear shear stress-shear strain behavior of granular fill reinforced with geosynthetics, and then used a finite difference scheme to solve it because of the complex mathematical derivations"
Zhan and Yin [24]_CITE studied the soil-geosynthetic interaction using a two-dimensional analytical model where vertical interaction was simulated using Winkler springs and horizontal interaction was simulated using shear springs
Deb et al [25]_CITE proposed a model to simulate the behavior of granular foundation beds reinforced with several layers of geosynthetics by using an iterative finite difference scheme

Yin concentrated on the tensile property of geosynthetics and applied the reinforced Timoshenko beam model to simulate the mechanism of geosynthetic reinforced granular fill subjected to a point load [32]_CITE and any kind of loading [33]_CITE
Shukla and Yin [34]_CITE assumed geosynthetic reinforced granular fill as a reinforced Timoshenko beam and investigated the time dependent settlement due to the consolidation of saturated soft foundation
But in reality there always exists a discontinuity in the slope of the vertical displacement at the edge of an overlying pavement structure [35]_CITE
"The governing equation of a lower Timoshenko beam [32]_CITE with a Pasternak foundation model as the substratum be written as (0 x L 1): (2)Dd4y2dx4+k1DCd2(y1 y2)dx2= 1h+k1(y1 y2) ksy2+ksDCd2y2dx2+G2d2y2dx2,where D and C are the bending stiffness and shear stiffness of the Timoshenko beam presented in the Appendix, 1 is the density of granular fill, ks is the modulus of foundation reaction, and G 2 is the shear stiffness of the underlying foundation soil"
"In order to verify the proposed exact solution, a finite element (FE) model was built using SIGMA/W [36]_CITE"
"According to the SIGMA/W manual [36]_CITE with the use of infinite elements in this model, the length considered in the FE modeling is 9 m (ie twice of 4.5 m) to diminish the effect of boundary condition"
Yin presented the derivational process of the reinforced Timoshenko beam in a technical paper [32]_CITE
"According to the theory of Timoshenko beam [2]_CITE, the relationship between moment M and the rate of rotation angle change can be written as: (A1)M= Dd dx,where is the angle of rotation and the positive direction is shown in Fig_A1 (b)"
The thickness of the geosynthetic layer is neglected in the determination of y c and the stiffness of I c of the beam as it is very thin compared with the thickness of the beam [32]_CITE.
"This model is at the minimum a rectangle-shaped close-up of the object (called a template) or a color histogram, but can be as sophisticated as an online-trained classifier ( Godec_et_al.,_2010_CITE), or a hierarchical description of the objects parts and their salient features ( Artner_et_al.,_2011_CITE)."
"Sources for the target model and the objects position in the initial frame are: user input, various segmentation and/or object recognition methods (eg Felzenszwalb_and_Huttenlocher,_2005_CITE), or an initialization sequence (this work)"
"VOS methods can be divided into two categories ( Celasun_et_al.,_2001_CITE):"
Two- frame motion/ object segmentation: Altunbasak_et_al._(1998)_CITE a combination of pixel-based and region-based segmentation methods
Castagno_et_al._(1998)_CITE describe a system for interactive video segmentation
Chen_et_al._(2006)_CITE propose an approach to segment highly articulated objects by employing weak-prior random forests
The work of Alatan_et_al._(1998)_CITE presents the activities of the COST 211 ter group dedicated toward image and video sequence analysis and segmentation
Multi- frame spatio-temporal segmentation/ tracking: Celasun_et_al._(2001)_CITE present VOS based on 2D meshes
"Tekalp_et_al._(1998)_CITE describe 2D mesh-based modeling of video objects as a compact representation of motion and shape for interactive video manipulation, compression, and indexing"
Li_et_al._(2001)_CITE propose to use affine motion models to estimate the motion of homogeneous regions.
"There are VOS methods explicitly dealing with the segmentation of articulated objects (eg Chen_et_al.,_2006_CITE), but the result of these approaches is still only a separation of foreground and background."
Lauer_and_Schn rr_(2010)_CITE present an approach to automatically segment multiple motions from tracked features points by spectral embedding and clustering of linear subspaces
Nordberg_and_Zografos_(2010)_CITE also work on motion segmentation and propose an approach using the geometry of 6 points in 2D images to infer motion consistency with regard to rigid 3D motion
"As in the work of Lauer_and_Schn rr_(2010)_CITE, they are able to segment the motion of an arbitrary number of moving objects"
Yan_et_al._(2008)_CITE use factorization to analyze the trajectories of tracked features and cluster them into subspaces corresponding to parts
"Walther_and_W rtz_(2009,_2008)_CITE a method to learn a 2D pictorial model of observed humans for pose estimation"
Drouin_et_al._(2008)_CITE propose an approach which incrementally identifies object parts in videos
"An extended region adjacency graph (eRAG) is a RAG that contains the so-called pseudo edges, which are self-loops and parallel edges used to encode neighborhood relations to a cell completely enclosed by one or more other cells ( Kropatsch,_1995_CITE)"
"A Delaunay triangulation ( Tuceryan_and_Chorzempa,_1991_CITE) is used in the first frame to insert the edges E, connect the features and represent their spatial relationships (see Fig_3 )."
"In ( Kropatsch_et_al.,_2007_CITE) three methods, MIES, MIS, and D3P (used in our experiments) for breaking large contraction kernels are described, and it is also shown that their difference in the context of segmentation is minimal."
"Note that the described grouping method is similar to the image segmentation method in ( Haxhimusa_and_Kropatsch,_2004_CITE), which also builds a graph pyramid and uses concepts of internal/external contrast"
"In each video the Kanade Lucas Tomasi tracker ( Birchfeld,_2008_CITE) is used to track corner points to supply the necessary motion information for the hierarchical grouping process."
Yan_et_al._(2008)_CITE are able to separate the object in six parts
"The X-, Y-, and Z-gradient coils produce gradients fields in the appropriate specified direction and, by activating combinations of these coils, gradient fields can be generated in any specified direction [1]_CITE"
Indeed the coupled simulation of magneto mechanical problems is a very hot topic with a large number of articles recently been published in journals and international conferences eg [2 9]_CITE as a small sample
"More recently, commercial packages for the solution of coupled electro magneto mechanical problems, such as ANSYS [10]_CITE, COMSOL Multiphysics [11]_CITE and Numerical analysis of Coupled Systems (NACS) [12]_CITE, have become available"
"In the context of magneto mechanical coupling in MRI scanners, Rausch et al [5]_CITE proposed a temporal solution algorithm using low order finite elements, which was later extended to also include acoustic effects [6]_CITE"
"More recently, the mechanical vibrations for ultra high frequency MRI scanners have been investigated [9]_CITE and a modal analysis has been presented, which is quoted to give a 20 100 factor reduction in computational time compared to a transient computation [8]_CITE"
These approaches have been reviewed in [13]_CITE
The evaluation of local forces using the electromotive stress tensor tends not to be pursued since the application of the divergence operator can lead to loss in accuracy (eg in the context of fluid structure interaction [14 16]_CITE)
"In the context of problems in electrostriction and magnetostriction in solids and fluids we have adopted an alternative approach for the calculation of electro magneto mechanical forces [18,19]_CITE, which recalls that the electromotive force can instead be expressed as the divergence of a stress tensor plus the addition of a momentum term [20,21]_CITE"
"In order to describe small deformations of conducting elastic bodies, due to the presence of electromagnetic forces exerted in an electro magneto mechanical system, the coupled set of time-dependent Maxwell equations (1a) H=J+ D t=Js+ ( U t B) +Jo+ D t, (1b) E= B t, (1c) B=0, (1d) D= e,and elasticity equation (2) m(U)+b(E,H)= m(U)+ eE+J B = 2U t2,must be solved eg [17]_CITE"
"In the context of developing a better understanding of the deformations caused by the presence of eddy currents in the conducting components of the cryostat, an appropriately scaled experiment was proposed by Siemens Magnet Technology, Siemens plc [31]_CITE"
"The free space region has been truncated a finite distance away from the conductor on the basis that the eddy current approximation applies, due to the high conductivity of the conducting components and the (relatively) low frequencies of operation that will be considered [32]_CITE"
"Furthermore, for the eddy current model, the electromagnetic fields decay away from the coils and conducting components according to [33]_CITE E=O(1|x|),H=O(1|x|)as|x| ,which, in turn, allows us to truncate the domain a finite distance away from the conducting components and coils and apply, as an approximation, zero tangential conditions on the fields at the outer boundary."
"In a departure from [4 6,8]_CITE, and following [21]_CITE, we note that b can be written as the divergence of a stress tensor plus a momentum term t(D B)"
"Computational approaches to the solution of this equation system in three dimensions, using low-order finite elements, have been presented in [3,5,7,17]_CITE."
"In the above, ADC is a static magnetic vector potential, the Coulomb gauge (9b) is used to ensure uniqueness of the solution (eg [25]_CITE) and the far field boundary condition follows from the previous approximation of the far field decay of the fields used in (7)."
"Considering first the three-dimensional domain DC, the weak form associated with (9) is: Find ADC XDC such that (23) DC 1 ADC wd = DCJDCs wd w XDC,where XDC:={ADC H(curl, DC): ADC=0in DC,n ADC=0on DC}.In an axisymmetric domain, this reduces to: Find A DC XDCcyl such that (24) DCp 1( A DC z w z+1r2 (rA DC) r (rw ) r)rdrdz= DCpJ DCsw rdrdz w XDCcyl,where DCp is the rotationally symmetric ( r, z) plane of DC and XDCcyl:={A DC:A DC L12( DCp),( A DC z1r (rA DC) r) (L12( DCp))2,A DC=0on },L12( DCp):={u:u L2( DCp),ru L2( DCp)},are suitable weighted spaces [26]_CITE, DC= 0 and 0 is the r=0 axis"
"With a finite element approach in mind, one could consider trying to derive suitable finite element basis functions for XDCcyl (eg in a similar way to [26]_CITE) or, alternatively, choose to treat the unbounded integrations by regularising through numerical integration [29]_CITE"
The discrete weak form is: Find A^ DChp X^DCcyl Xhp such that (27) DCp 1r p(r2A^ DChp) p(r2w^ hp)drdz= DCpJ DCsw^ hpr2drdzfor all w^ hp X^DCcyl Xhp where Xhp H 1( p) is a suitable set of hierarchic basis functions eg [35]_CITE.
"In cylindrical coordinates the linearised strain tensor for u=urer+uzez becomes =[ rr r rz r z zr z zz]=[ ur r012( ur z+ uz r)0urr012( ur z+ uz r)0 uz z],which is also the form quoted by Zienkiewicz [30]_CITE as well as Timoshenko and Goodier [36]_CITE"
"In each of these figures, we also make comparisons with the results obtained from the commercial NACS software [12]_CITE developed by SIMetris GmbH using low order p=1 elements and a mesh of 7857 elements"
"In particular, in order to properly understand the behaviour of the fields in this region, an accurate discretisation is required particularly in the frequency range 3 4 KHz, which is also known to be associated with the free vibration resonant frequencies of the screens and OVC if treated as thin cylindrical shells [37]_CITE (see equation (2.26))"
"Moreover, we believe that a significant computational gain could be obtained by implementation of our computational approach in an alternative language such as Fortran and utilising parallel processing for the trivially parallelisable frequency sweep rather than the serial vectorised MATLAB [38]_CITE implementation used here"
In order to explain the need for higher fidelity discretisations as the frequency increases one should consider the skin depth :=2/( 0 ) [32]_CITE
Recall that the skin depth measures the depth to which the current density has fallen to 1/ e of its surface value and that at higher frequencies smaller skin depths are to be expected [25]_CITE
Neonatal seizures are the most common neurological emergency in the neonate and are a serious concern for clinicians and parents worldwide [1]_CITE
Only about one third of all neonatal seizures are clinically visible [2]_CITE and many remain undetected in the busy Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) environment
"This expertise is not available on a 24 h basis, 7 days a week [3]_CITE"
"To fill the gap in the lack of availability of experts, clinical staff in the NICU are using a simpler form of EEG monitoring, called amplitude integrated EEG or aEEG [4]_CITE"
"The first follows analytical learning principles [18]_CITE and focuses on the creation of a set of heuristic rules and thresholds from clinical prior knowledge [6 8,10,12 15]_CITE"
"The second approach relies on inductive learning [18]_CITE and utilizes model-based parameterization [9,16]_CITE or statistical classifier based methods [11,19,20]_CITE, which employ elements of machine learning to classify a set of features using a data-driven decision rule"
"Our group has recently developed [19,21]_CITE, validated [20]_CITE and patented [22]_CITE an accurate and robust real-time neonatal seizure detection system combining both of these approaches"
"In this context, when the developed technology approaches cot-side implementation, it becomes important to build a viable interface between the new engineering component and established medical environments [23 25]_CITE"
It has been shown that frequencies of neonatal EEG seizures range between 0.5 and 13 Hz and the dominant frequencies of seizures vary between 0.5 and 6 Hz [26]_CITE
The most recent recommendations by the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology [27]_CITE suggest that 5 is the minimum seizure duration if the background EEG is normal and 10 if the background EEG is abnormal
The output of the SVM is converted to probability-like values with a sigmoid function [28]_CITE
A wider feature set which included spectral slope features from speech recognition has been examined in [29]_CITE
A Gaussian mixture model classifier has been developed in [30]_CITE and contrasted to SVM with the classifier combination performed in [31]_CITE
Adaptive spatial weighting of EEG channels based on the statistics of spatial neonatal seizure distributions has been introduced in [32]_CITE
"Similarly, temporal weighting of the probabilistic output of the classifier based on the statistically most likely locations of neonatal seizures since the time of birth has been introduced in [21]_CITE"
"The short term seizure event context has been shown to increase the robustness of the detector to the seizure-like artefacts, in particular the respiration artefact [33]_CITE."
"The developed system has been validated in [20,21,33]_CITE using leave-one-patient-out (LOO) cross validation which is known to provide the least biased assessment of performance"
"Subsequently, the system was independently validated in [34]_CITE on a separate dataset of 41 neonates (full-term HIE, 7 with seizures, 377 seizures) and, more recently in [33]_CITE, on a larger randomised dataset comprising 51 full-term neonates with HIE (24 with seizures, 1142 seizures, totalling 2540 h of multi-channel in duration)"
"There have been numerous studies that report low sensitivity of this tool for neonatal seizure detection and its inappropriateness for use in the neonatal population in general [5,42]_CITE"
The aEEG emphasises the amplitude of the EEG signal [35]_CITE
The optimal threshold is a slope on the operating curve and finding it is a difficult task in its own right [36]_CITE
"Human EEG has previously been audified for the purpose of the detection of epilepsy in adults in [37,38]_CITE"
"Then, the EEG is passed through the phase vocoder [39,40]_CITE to change the temporal characteristics of the signal while retaining its short-time spectral characteristics"
"Several differences in how these metrics should be computed for online, in contrast to offline systems, for seizure detection have been addressed in [41]_CITE"
"Eleven 1 h 8-channel EEG segments were selected from the database of continuous neonatal EEG [19,21]_CITE"
"For instance, in [43]_CITE using aEEG 57% of the seizure-containing records were detected with no false-positive seizure detections in control records"
Sensitivity of 38% and specificity of 92% using aEEG were reported in [5]_CITE
Sensitivity of 12% 38% has been reported in [43]_CITE
The upper most trace displays the probabilistic output which is plotted in blue when it is below the threshold and in red when it surpasses the threshold and complies with the artefact detector [33]_CITE
"A clinical DSS is defined as interactive computer software which is designed to assist healthcare professionals in the decision making process [49,57]_CITE"
There exist a number of taxonomies that can describe a given DSS [50]_CITE
The model of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology has also been used in [54]_CITE
The key experiences from previous efforts to design and implement clinical DSS have also been summarised in [58]_CITE
"The quality and timeliness of information provided by the developed DSS have been tackled by the rigorous technical validation [19,33]_CITE and will be addressed in further studies of the group in the evidence from the clinical trial."
It is true that the pathway to clinical adoption of any DSS is partly hindered by the unnecessary workflow disruptions introduced [57]_CITE
"The importance of integrating a newly developed DSS into the established clinical workflow has been stressed in many studies [49,51]_CITE"
Analysis of 70 randomised controlled trials reported in [52]_CITE has concluded that an effective clinical DSS must minimise the effort required by clinicians to receive and act on system recommendations
The five rights of the clinical DSS are known as right information to the right people through the right channel in the right form and at the right time [58]_CITE
"In other words, the key questions are those whose decisions are being supported, what information is presented, when it is presented and how it is presented [57]_CITE"
"The latter, the problem of very dense display of data in the context of intensive cares units while monitoring patients with severe brain injury has been addressed in [55]_CITE including temporal data abstraction, principal component analysis, and clustering methods"
A number of intelligent information visualization methods have been surveyed in [56]_CITE
Recent works on the intelligent visualization and interpretation of clinical data have been reviewed in [61]_CITE
It has been argued that error management theory may explain the evolution of cognitive and behavioural biases in human decision making under uncertainty [59]_CITE
"In this manner, the load imposed by information gathering goals can be alleviated to allocate more cognitive resources for discriminating among hypothesis and making complex decisions [60]_CITE."
"Neonatal seizures are a common emergency in intensive care, occurring in about 1 3 per 1000 babies born at term (they are more common in preterm babies, [45]_CITE)"
"Globally, this is a much larger problem with 23% of the 4 million neonatal deaths worldwide being due to perinatal asphyxia [46]_CITE"
"The disability experienced by survivors includes cerebral palsy, epilepsy and learning difficulties [47]_CITE"
EEG studies carried out by ourselves and others have shown this to be inaccurate and unreliable and to lack any evidence base [48]_CITE
"Increasingly, clinicians are using cot-side aEEG to guide their therapy but surveys show that interpretation skills are limited, and this method does not reliably detect all seizures [3]_CITE"
These polynomials are closely related to the Bernoulli polynomials [28]_CITE.
"The sequence of the Euler polynomials En(x),n 0 is defined by the exponential generating function (42)H(x,t)=2extet+1= k=0 Ek(x)tkk!.The basic properties of Euler numbers and polynomials can be found in [10,12,28,39]_CITE."
The identity (78) is Theorem 3.3 in the very recent paper [20]_CITE.
"Among the applications, we should stress that a simple proof for the main result in [6]_CITE, (see also [40]_CITE) is given"
"All properties and results of this paper are tested using the Computer Algebra System (CAS), Maple [33]_CITE."
"For purposes of compatibility, network protocols conceptually although not always in practice follow the OSI model [3]_CITE"
Internet-enabled smartphone apps are similarly agnostic as to whether they are connected via WiFi or the cellular data network for the same reason [6]_CITE
"Should an encryption scheme contain a flaw (as they have in the case of both WEP [7]_CITE and the original WPA [8]_CITE) then communications can be decoded easily, remotely and usually without trace."
The abundance of private information stored on modern mobile devices is well-established [9]_CITE
An interesting twist on the spam business model is to generate revenue by calling premium-rate numbers or sending SMS [10]_CITE
"Given the wealth of personal information and functionality that could be available to unrestricted programmes, great efforts have been made to set up permissions systems to regulate app behaviour [10,11]_CITE."
These and similar unique identifiers pervade unprotected network communications [14]_CITE
"London controversial tracking bins that included hardware to collect WiFi-enabled device identifiers as owners passed in the street to track their movements [15]_CITE, and Westfield Groups programme to perform similar shopping habits analysis with mobile phone identifiers [16]_CITE"
"These can be located using the same databases that aid mobile GPS navigation to determine the home, workplace and other locations important to the user of a mobile device [17]_CITE"
"Disposable Network IDs would work to inhibit analysis of this kind [18]_CITE and while it would make tracking specific users between sessions much harder, it would not prevent the analysis presented in this paper."
"With increased signal strength and directional antenna, WiFi networks using have been operated effectively point-to-point over hundreds of kilometres [19]_CITE"
Side-channel analysis is famed for its use in breaking encryption but remains an often-overlooked threat [20]_CITE
Power analysis of Data Encryption Standard (DES) hardware [21]_CITE and timing analysis of the RSA algorithm [22]_CITE leaked enough information about the state of the encryption processes to undermine them
Observing the older implementations of the SSH login protocol showed that password length could be deduced from the size of the packets sent to the server and padding was added to secure the process [23]_CITE
"The anonymity-preserving Tor network also added methods to obfuscate the timing and size characteristics of traffic after it was shown that visiting certain websites could be fingerprinted [24,25]_CITE"
"Similarly, Chen et al [26]_CITE investigated HTTPS side-channel leaks for secure cloud services handling personal healthcare and tax information"
Another study found that it was possible to deduce certain categories of Google search despite the user connecting over encrypted HTTPS to a distributed Content Delivery Network [27]_CITE.
"In mobile-specific work, St ber et al [28]_CITE looked to identify the apps signified by variations in their sync (regular update) activity on Android devices"
"Observing passively from a perspective external to the network, Zhang et al [29]_CITE found they were able to classify broad categories of encrypted WiFi traffic ( eg video streaming, web browsing) and Atkinson et al [30,31]_CITE showed it was possible to specifically target Skype traffic for identification."
"For example, it was shown that the tiny but frequently updated information from Smart Grid power meters could be used to not only infer the appliances used [32]_CITE, but also how the usage of these appliances could then leak further information about occupants behaviour"
"Going even further, the authors hypothesise that certain behaviours can be correlated with predictable social timings such as church or bar opening times to expose even greater depths of private information [33]_CITE."
"Previous classification efforts attempted to sample network data directly from this position [29,31,35]_CITE"
"As an Android-specific interface for the commonly known TCPDump [37]_CITE, it saves network data to standard PCap (packet capture) format for later processing"
The exact distribution of these delays vary by device [39]_CITE
"However, they should be no more problematic than the already variable Round Trip Times (RTTs) inherent in internet communications [40]_CITE and variation over the 3 different network configurations we use"
"Recorded over several weeks with automatic software updates disabled, our mobile devices were controlled via USB connection in conjunction with automation software [41]_CITE"
"Popularised by Breiman and Cutler [44]_CITE, Random Forests are a supervised, non-parametric machine learning technique and therefore rely on carefully labelled sample data"
"Unlike machine learning methods that evaluate error with a single test following classifier construction, it is therefore considered unbiased [44]_CITE."
"A Decision Tree within the Random Forest is grown as follows [45]_CITE: 1.Generate a new random training subset for each tree: N training samples with known class labels are taken from the complete dataset with replacement (a sample can be selected multiple times).2.Grow the tree: At each node in the tree, select a different random selection of m variables from the M total in each sample"
"Specially designed VPNs [46]_CITE and anonymity networks such as Tor [47]_CITE pad frame sizes, adjust timings, and intermix network traffic"
"This kind of inference underpins the modern practice of targeted advertising [13,48]_CITE"
"We hope this work will spur interest and the development of countermeasures appropriate for mobile devices, such as Tor Orbot [49]_CITE"
"While free-to-download apps like the ones used in this study form approximately 90% the mobile app market [50]_CITE, there are many paid apps"
Tools such as NetworkProfiler [51]_CITE could allow for all user actions (and therefore all network activity) paths to be mapped through the app programmatically.
This was seen an appropriate assumption given the modal nature of mobile apps and is a common assumption in related fingerprinting studies [25]_CITE
"They use their experience and/or handbooks in order to program adequate cutting parameters ( Balakrishana_&_DeVries,_1982;_Liang,_Hecker,_&_Landers,_2004_CITE)"
"As a first solution adaptive controllers substituted fixed gain controllers in order to behave better under sensible changes in the depth of cut ( Koren,_1989_CITE)"
"Those techniques present multi-function optimization through, for example, neural networks, genetic algorithms and other bio-inspired techniques ( Avellan,_Romeros,_Siller,_Estrud,_&_Vila,_2008;_Cus_&_Balic,_2003;_Surech_et_al.,_in_press;_Wong_&_Hamouda_2003b;_Zuperl_&_Cus_2003;_Zuperl,_Cus,_&_Milfelner_2005_CITE)"
"Also in Vidal,_Alberti,_Ciurana,_and_Casades s_(2005)_CITE computer aided process planning is used for choosing the manufacturing route in metal removal processes and their cutting parameters"
"On the other hand, Zhang_and_Lu_(1992)_CITE discussed an expert system for economic evaluation of machining planning operation through integration of the manufacturing and management systems, trying to plan technical issues tied to the economical ones such as amortization of the machine, taking into account labour, materials and working capacity"
"In Morgan,_Cheng,_Altintas,_and_Ridgway_(2007)_CITE, the milling system is fully diagnosed using FL, providing sources of machining problems and corrective actions"
"Finally, in Iqbal,_He,_Li,_and_Dar_(2007)_CITE, tool life is enhanced and work-piece surface finish improved using experimental data and if-then rules through analysis of variance techniques and numeric optimization"
"Moreover, some theoretical and experimental work has been carried out in order to get optimal machining parameters subject to dimensional precision and surface quality, tool life expectancy and production times ( Chien_&_Chou,_2001;_Vivanco,_Luis,_Costa,_&_Ortiz_2004_CITE and references therein); in different machining processes and using different materials."
"In this frame of mind, the standard milling system responds to a second order differential equation excited by the cutting forces, F( t) ( Budak_and_Altintas,1998;_Landers_&_Ulsoy,_1993_CITE), (1)M r (t)+B r (t)+C r(t)=F(t)where r( t) = { x( t), y( t)} T are the relative displacements between the tool and the workpiece in the X Y plane, F( t) = { Fx( t), Fy( t)} T, and M, B and C are the modal mass, damping and stiffness matrices, all of them represented in two dimensions"
"The milling cutting force is represented by a tangential force proportional with the instantaneous chip thickness, and a radial force which is expressed in terms of the tangential force ( Balanchandran,_2001;_Budak_&_Altintas,_1998_CITE) (2)Ft(t)=Kt adc tc(t)andFr(t)=Kr Ftwhere Kt and Kr, the tangential and radial specific cutting constants which are dependent on the tool material for any geometry, adc, the axial depth of cut and, tc( t), the chip thickness, obtaining the cutting forces in Cartesian coordinates ( Balanchandran,_2001_CITE)"
"It can be solved numerically ( Budak_&_Altintas,_1998;_Insperger_&_Stepan,_2002_CITE) or analytically ( Stepan,_1989_CITE)."
"Then, a continuous transfer function which relates both signals, measured resultant force and the actual feed delivered by the drive motor can be showed as a first order dynamic ( Altintas,_2000_CITE), (4)Gp(s)=Fp(s)fa(s)=Kcadcr("
"At the same time, the relationship between the machine tool control, the CNC and, the motor drive system can be approximated as a first order system within the range of working frequencies ( Altintas,_2000_CITE)"
"The combined transfer function of the system is given by Altintas_(2000)_CITE, (6)Gc(S)=Fp(s)fc(s)=Kp( 0s+1)( s+1)with Kp(kN s/mm)=Kc adc /Nt Ss."
"Milling processes basically consist of three possible phases: roughing, medium and finishing the surface ( Juneja,_Sekhon,_&_Seth_2003_CITE)"
"Another reason is that wear changes the geometry of the tool, which can either lead to degradation in cutting accuracy and speed or more frequent tool changes which increases production time ( Kalpakjian_&_Schmidt,_2000_CITE)."
"Roughness is one measure of the texture of the surface and is another indicator of quality of the final product ( Baek,_Ko,_&_Kim,_1997_CITE) that is affected by both tool wear and vibrations"
"The main source of vibrations in milling arises from the regenerative effect ( Altintas,_2000;_Balanchandran,_2001_CITE) known as chatter vibrations which are typically modelled by the Eqs"
"Other sources of vibrations are couple-mode ( Tlusty_&_Koenigsberger,_1970_CITE) and forced vibrations ( Sutherland_&_Andrew,_1968_CITE)."
"Keeping the forces under a prescribed safe upper limit prevents the system from having deflections on the tool and avoids tool damage and breakage ( Altintas,_1992_CITE)"
"From this we can see that there is a trade-off between deflection of the tool and material remove rate when programming the reference forces ( Altintas,_2000;_Rubio,_De_la_Sen,_&_Bilbao-Guillerma,_2007a,b;_Zuperl_et_al.,_2005_CITE)."
"Therefore, the power drawn from the spindle motor constrains the machining efficiency ( Maeda,_Cao,_&_ALtintas_2005_CITE)"
"The cutting power is found from Eq (7) ( Altintas,_2000;_Maeda_et_al._2005_CITE) as, (7)Pt= D Ss j=1NtFtj("
"The cutting power Pt , max required for the spindle motor is the maximum value among the instantaneous power Pt in one tooth period ( Altintas,_2000;_Maeda_et_al._2005_CITE) (8)Pt,max=max(Pt)"
"Some research works use the empirical relationship of the Eq (14), ( Kalpakjian_&_Schmidt,_2000;_Wong_&_Hamouda,_2003a;_Wong_&_Hamouda,_2003b_CITE)"
"Then, for a given operation, ifk=k o=l ko,l Nandji Ji i Ji=J i, i,then if ko(i-1)koiJi> ko(i-1)koiJ i,ci 1+ iJ i-JiJ ici,else if ko(i-1)koiJi The steepest ascendant method is based on the estimation of a parameter vector in order to maximize a cost function ( Passino,_2004_CITE)"
"Some approaches for on-line detection of chatter can be found in Soliman_and_Ismail_(1997),_Li,_Wong,_and_Nee_(1997)_CITE and Gradisek,_Govekar,_and_Gravec_(1998)_CITE"
"In our case, the following algorithmic methodology has been taken into consideration ( Campomanes_&_Altintas,_2003_CITE): (18)If =hd,maxhs,max>1.25 then there exists chatter vibration, where hd"

"Here, we deal with the rates of approximation of Twf in the setting of modular spaces, which contain as particular cases Lp, Orlicz and Musielak-Orlicz spaces (see also [2,8,18,19,28,33]_CITE)"
"In the context of filter convergence, some computations of rates of approximation were given in [26]_CITE for Korovkin-type theorems"
"A particular case of filter convergence is the statistical convergence, introduced in [27,37]_CITE."
"Some examples used frequently in the literature are (W, )=(N, ), or W [a,w0[ R endowed with the usual order, where w0 R {+ } is a limit point of W (see for instance [18,_Section_3.2]_CITE)"
"For every w W let Lw be the set of all measurable non-negative functions Lw:G G R, and suppose that Lw is F -homogeneous uniformly with respect to w W, namely there is a set F F with (1)Lw( +s,u+s)=Lw( ,u)for every ,s,u Gandw F (see also [18,_Section_4.1]_CITE)."
"(a) For some examples of regular families in the classical context see also [2,9]_CITE.(b) Analogously as pointed out in [2,_Section_3]_CITE, observe that, by virtue of our assumptions and taking into account (5), the family lw,w W, generates a family of F-regular measures mw"
"Note that, if is a quasi-convex modular, then L (G)={f L0(G):there is >0with ( f)<+ }(see also [18]_CITE)."
Observe that the Fcofin-modular convergence is equivalent to usual modular convergence (see also [18]_CITE).
"Observe that, in general, the hypothesis that w WHw =G is essential (see also [7,_Remark_4]_CITE)."
"If G=R or G=Hw for every w W, (t)=|t| with >0, then Lip( ) is the classical discrete Zygmund class (see also [2,23]_CITE)"
"If further W=[1,+ [ and (w)=w- , then we observe that condition (17) is linked to the existence of suitable moments of order (see for instance [18,_Example_3.9]_CITE)."
It is known that (48) 0+ Lw (t)dtt=1for everyw W(see also [21]_CITE)
"For other examples of kernels existing in the literature (for instance F jer, Picard, box-spline, Abel-Poisson and F jer-Korovkin-type kernels), see also [2,_Section_6]_CITE."
"Note that for every compact interval [a,b] R+ the function abLw tsdttbelongs to Lq(R+, ), where is as in (36), for every 1 q<+ and w large enough (depending on q), where Lw ,w W, is as in (43), (47) or (52) (see also [21]_CITE)."
"Now, proceeding analogously as in [21,_Example_2]_CITE, it is possible to check that in general our results are proper extensions of the corresponding classical ones."
Observe that these three sets have asymptotic density zero (see also [25]_CITE).
"From (44) and (46) we get that the moment kernel satisfies (42) and all the (F, )-singularity conditions, with w=0, (t)=|logt| and (w)=w- , where 0 Furthermore (see also [29,_Proposition_1]_CITE) observe that the family of functions mn:R+ M1 R0+ defined by mn(s,A)= ALn tsdtt,s R+,A M1,n N,is F-regular and F-compatible with the modular defined as in (10) for every , where is as in Section 2"

"Neurophysiological data about perceptual experiences like binocular rivalry illustrate this fact (eg, Logothetis,_1998_CITE) and neural models have explained, and indeed predicted, key properties of these data ( Grossberg,_1987;_Grossberg,_Yazdanbakhsh,_Cao,_&_Swaminathan,_2008_CITE)"
"Indeed, early mathematical results about the brain functional units of short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) proved that the functional units of both STM and LTM are distributed patterns across networks of feature-selective cells ( Grossberg,_1968a,_1968b,_1973_CITE)"

"ART accomplishes these properties by proposing how top-down expectations focus attention on salient combinations of cues, called critical feature patterns ( Fig_1); characterizes how attention may operate via a form of self-normalizing biased competition ( Bhatt,_Carpenter,_&_Grossberg,_2007;_Carpenter_&_Grossberg,_1987,_1991;_Desimone,_1998;_Reynolds_&_Heeger,_2009_CITE); and explains how top-down attentive matching may help to solve the stability plasticity dilemma"
"For example, attention and learning are linked in a manner consistent with ART predictions about visual perceptual learning (eg, Ahissar_and_Hochstein_(1993,_1997)_CITE), Ito,_Westheimer,_and_Gilbert_(1998)_CITE, and Lu_and_Dosher_(2004)_CITE, auditory learning (eg, Gao_&_Suga,_1998_CITE), and somatosensory learning (eg, Krupa,_Ghazanfar,_and_Nicolelis_(1999)_CITE and Parker_and_Dostrovsky_(1999)_CITE), including an explanation ( Grossberg,_2003a_CITE) of when and how perceptual learning can occur without focused attention or conscious awareness (eg, Seitz_and_Watanabe_(2003)_CITE and Watanabe,_Nanez,_and_Sasaki_(2001)_CITE)"
"ART also predicted links between attention and synchronous oscillations that were subsequently experimentally reported (eg, Buschman_and_Miller_(2007)_CITE, Engel,_Fries,_and_Singer_(2001)_CITE, Gregoriou,_Gotts,_Zhou,_and_Desimone_(2009)_CITE, Grossberg_(2009)_CITE, and Pollen_(1999)_CITE), and between synchronous oscillations and consciousness (eg, Lamme_(2006)_CITE, Llinas,_Ribary,_Contreras,_and_Pedroarena_(1998)_CITE, and Singer_(1998)_CITE)"
"These include equations for short-term memory, or STM; medium-term memory, or MTM; and long-term memory, or LTM, that were introduced in Grossberg_(1968c,_1969)_CITE; see Grossberg_(2013b)_CITE for a review"
"The first paradigm is called Complementary Computing ( Grossberg,_2000a_CITE)"
"For example, the category learning, attention, recognition, and prediction circuits of ART are part of the ventral, or What, cortical processing stream for perception and cognition ( Mishkin,_1982;_Mishkin,_Ungerleider,_&_Macko,_1983_CITE)"
"The ventral stream exhibits properties that are often computationally complementary to those of the dorsal, or Where and How, cortical processing steam for spatial representation and action ( Goodale_&_Milner,_1992;_Mishkin,_1982;_Mishkin_et al.,_1983_CITE)"
"Neon color spreading was reported in Varin_(1971)_CITE, who studied a chromatic spreading effect that was induced when viewing an image similar to the one in Fig_3"
"These orientationally-tuned simple cells ( Hubel_&_Wiesel,_1968_CITE) can respond to an oriented distribution of contrasts in response to scenic lines, edges, textures, and shading, not just edges alone ( Fig_4(a))"
"Spatial and orientational competition prevent this catastrophe from occurring by closing boundary gaps at line ends using end cuts ( Grossberg_&_Mingolla,_1985_CITE)"
"This perceptual catastrophe is averted by complex cells at which the outputs of like-oriented dark-light and light-dark simple cells are added at each position ( Fig_4(a); Hubel_&_Wiesel,_1968_CITE)"
"They cannot discriminate between dark-light and light-dark contrasts, or red green and green red contrasts, or blue yellow and yellow blue contrasts, because they pool together inputs from simple cells that are sensitive to all of these differences ( Thorell,_De_Valois,_&_Albrecht,_1984_CITE) to form the best possible boundaries"
"Its cells are often called hypercomplex cells ( Hubel_&_Wiesel,_1968_CITE)"
"These boundary completion cells are often called bipole cells ( Cohen_&_Grossberg,_1984;_Grossberg,_1984a;_Grossberg_&_Mingolla,_1985_CITE) because they complete boundaries inwardly in an oriented manner between pairs (bipoles!) of boundary inducers"
"Predicted bipole grouping properties ( Fig_6 , top row, left column) have been supported by psychophysical data (eg, Field,_Hayes,_&_Hess,_1993;_Kellman_&_Shipley,_1991_CITE), and neurophysiological data from cells in cortical area V2 (eg, Peterhans_&_von_der_Heydt,_1989;_von_der_Heydt,_Peterhans,_&_Baumgartner,_1984_CITE), among others"
"This coarseness can be understood as the embodiment within bipole receptive fields of perceptual experiences with nearly collinear and aligned visual stimuli during cortical development ( Grossberg_&_Swaminathan,_2004;_Grossberg_&_Williamson,_2001_CITE)"
"Completed boundaries input topographically to surface representations where they are both generators of, and barriers to, surface filling-in ( Grossberg,_1994,_1997;_Grossberg_&_Yazdanbakhsh,_2005;_Kelly_&_Grossberg,_2000_CITE)"
"One psychophysiological marker of such a resonant match is the processing negativity, or PN, event-related potential ( Fig_11; Banquet_&_Grossberg,_1987;_Grossberg,_1978a,_1984b;_N t nen,_1982_CITE)."
"These results contribute to a long history of experiments that have implicated the hippocampus in mismatch processing, including the processing of novel events (eg, Deadwyler,_West,_&_Lynch,_1979;_Deadwyler,_West,_&_Robinson,_1981;_Otto_&_Eichenbaum,_1992;_Solokov,_1968;_Vinogradova,_1975_CITE)."
"These are properties of the N200 event-related potential, or ERP ( Fig_11; N t nen,_Simpson,_&_Loveless,_1982;_Sams,_Paavilainen,_Alho,_&_an,_1985_CITE)"
"More generally, during an ART memory search, sequences of mismatch, arousal, and reset events occur that exhibit properties of P120, N200, and P300 ERPs, respectively ( Banquet_&_Grossberg,_1987_CITE)."
"More difficult discriminations, at least under proper circumstances, should lead to higher vigilance, more mismatch events, and thus more of the hippocampal novelty responses found by Brincat_and_Miller_(2015)_CITE and Otto_and_Eichenbaum_(1992)_CITE"
"During these mismatch events, ERPs should progress in the temporal order that was described by Banquet_and_Grossberg_(1987)_CITE."
"All of these properties have been reported in experiments on working memory whose recordings were taken from lateral prefrontal cortex and the frontal eye fields ( Lundqvist_et al.,_2016_CITE)"
"Another kind of complementary ignorance is overcome through resonance within the attentional system, and thereby solves the symbol grounding problem ( Harnad,_1990_CITE): When a feature pattern is activated at level F1 ( Fig_13(a)), its individual features have no meaning"
"These studies have explained, and successfully predicted, data about such varied topics as texture segregation ( Bhatt_et al.,_2007_CITE); visual scene recognition ( Grossberg_&_Huang,_2009_CITE); learning of view-, position-, and size-invariant inferotemporal recognition categories, and recoding of inferotemporal categories during target swapping ( Cao,_Grossberg,_&_Markowitz,_2011_CITE); gamma and beta oscillations during top-down matches and mismatches, respectively ( Grossberg,_2013a;_Grossberg_&_Versace,_2008_CITE); learning of concrete or abstract recognition categories under variable vigilance ( Amis,_Carpenter,_Ersoy,_&_Grossberg,_2009;_Grossberg,_Markowitz,_&_Cao,_2011_CITE); breakdown of vigilance control during mental disorders such as autism ( Grossberg_&_Seidman,_2006_CITE); and fast visual attention switching during the recognition of letter or number targets during rapid serial visual presentations ( Grossberg_&_Stone,_1986a_CITE)."
"As will be seen in Section 16, similar model mechanisms, specialized for learning about sequences of events, support explanations of data about contextually-cued search of visual scenes ( Huang_&_Grossberg,_2010_CITE), recognition and recall of visually presented words ( Grossberg_&_Stone,_1986b_CITE); and recognition and recall of auditorily presented words ( Boardman,_Grossberg,_Myers,_&_Cohen,_1999;_Grossberg,_Boardman,_&_Cohen,_1997;_Grossberg_&_Kazerounian,_2011,_2016;_Grossberg_&_Myers,_2000;_Kazerounian_&_Grossberg,_2014_CITE)."
"The ART dynamics in Fig_13 also consider only one form of object attention ( Posner,_1980_CITE), the prototype attention within the What cortical stream that focuses attention upon the critical feature pattern of a view- and position-specific category prototype ( Fig_1)"
"In order to explain how invariant category learning occurs with the help of surface-shroud resonances, ARTSCAN proposes how object attention interacts with spatial attention ( Duncan,_1984_CITE) in the Where/How cortical stream"
"Resonant states that are not accessible to consciousness include parietal prefrontal resonances that trigger the selective opening of basal ganglia gates to enable the read-out of contextually-appropriate thoughts and actions (see Section 18.2; Brown,_Bullock,_&_Grossberg,_2004;_Buschman_&_Miller,_2007;_Grossberg,_2016b_CITE) and entorhinal hippocampal resonances that dynamically stabilize the learning of entorhinal grid cells and hippocampal place cells during spatial navigation (see Section 19.8; Grossberg_&_Pilly,_2014;_Kentros,_Agniotri,_Streater,_Hawkins,_&_Kandel,_2004;_Morris_&_Frey,_1997;_Pilly_&_Grossberg,_2012_CITE)"
"Taken together, these signals form a recurrent on-center off-surround network that is capable of contrast-enhancing and normalizing its activities ( Grossberg,_1973,_1980_CITE)"
"In addition to explaining many perceptual data about 3D vision and figure-ground perception, the FACADE and 3D LAMINART models have anticipated many neurophysiological data about figure-ground properties of V2 cells, and have recently explained (see Grossberg, 2016a_CITE) all the key data properties reported in a remarkable series of neurophysiological experiments on V2 cells from the von der Heydt lab ( O Herron_&_von_der_Heydt,_2009;_Qiu,_Sugihara,_&_von_der_Heydt,_2007;_Qiu_&_von_der_Heydt,_2005;_von_der_Heydt,_Zhou,_&_Friedman,_2000;_Zhang_&_von_der_Heydt,_2010;_Zhou,_Friedman,_&_von_der_Heydt,_2000_CITE)"
"Only after this stage can these representations be brought into consciousness by a surface-shroud resonance, also not specified in Crick_and_Koch_(1995)_CITE or in their subsequent analyses."
"The concept of a surface-shroud resonance was discovered during the development of the family of ARTSCAN models ( Fazl,_Grossberg,_&_Mingolla,_2009;_Grossberg,_2009_CITE), whose culmination is currently the 3D ARTSCAN Search model ( Figs_17 and 18 ; Chang,_Grossberg,_&_Cao,_2014;_Grossberg,_Srinivasan,_&_Yazdanbakhsh,_2014_CITE)"
"The ARTSCAN models show how this may be accomplished by coordinating spatial attention and eye movements in the Where cortical processing stream with object attention and invariant object category learning in the What cortical stream ( Mishkin_et al.,_1983_CITE)"
"The Where stream is also called the How stream because of its important role in controlling actions in space ( Goodale_&_Milner,_1992_CITE)"
"The prediction that a surface-shroud resonance supports percepts of conscious visual qualia answers a long-standing question that arose from two earlier predictions: (1) ART predicted that all conscious states are resonant states ( Grossberg,_1980_CITE), and (2) the FACADE and 3D LAMINART models predicted that all conscious visual qualia are surface percepts ( Grossberg,_1994_CITE)"
"After a delay of 20 years, Grossberg_(2013a)_CITE finally had enough evidence to propose that surface-shroud resonances play this role"
"The hypothesis that a surface-shroud resonance has its generators between V4 and PPC helps to explain various data about visual consciousness, such as data about visual neglect (eg, Bellmann,_Meuli,_&_Clarke,_2001;_Driver_&_Mattingley,_1998;_Marshall,_2001;_Mesulam,_1999_CITE), perceptual crowding (eg, Bouma,_1970,_1973;_Foley,_Grossberg,_&_Mingolla,_2012;_Green_&_Bavelier,_2007;_He,_Cavanagh,_&_Intriligator,_1996;_Intriligator_&_Cavanagh,_2001;_Levi,_2008_CITE), change blindness and motion-induced blindness ( Grindley_&_Townsend,_1965;_Pashler,_1988;_Phillips,_1974;_Ramachandran_&_Gregory,_1991;_Rensink,_O Regan,_&_Clark,_1997;_Simons_&_Rensink,_2005_CITE), all of which will now be discussed"
"The clinical literature on visual neglect is extensive, complex, and subtle, with uncertainties and debates still ongoing (eg, Behrmann,_Geng,_&_Shomstein,_2004;_Husain_&_Nachev,_2007;_Karnath_&_Rorden,_2012;_Nachev_&_Husain,_2006_CITE)"
"The classical article of Driver_and_Mattingley_(1998)_CITE reviews visual neglect properties in individuals who have experienced IPL lesions, particularly in the right hemisphere"
"A neglect patient who appeared to be blind in the left visual field when fixating straight ahead, or to her left, could detect events in her left visual field when she fixated to the right ( Kooistra_&_Heilman,_1989_CITE)"
"In the latter patients, whose lesions are presumed to be less severe, a deficit in awareness only emerges when stimuli are presented simultaneously on both sides; eg, Posner,_Walker,_Friedrich,_and_Rafal_(1984)_CITE"
"However, such extinction can be eliminated if the two events get grouped as a single object, even if the link between the two stimuli is amodally completed behind an occluder ( Mattingley,_Davis,_&_Driver,_1997_CITE)"
"Spatial attention can flow along such a boundary grouping ( boundary attention ), whether real or illusory, as reported in neurophysiological experiments by Roelfsema,_Lamme,_and_Spekreijse_(1998)_CITE and Wanning,_Stanisor,_and_Roelfsema_(2011)_CITE, and simulated using the LAMINART model in Grossberg_and_Raizada_(2000)_CITE"
"Such a flow of spatial attention also helps to explain properties of social cognition, such as joint attention between a teacher and a student ( Grossberg_&_Vladusich,_2010_CITE) and how it may break down during autism ( Grossberg_&_Seidman,_2006_CITE)."
"The implicit knowledge of parietal patients includes object attributes of neglected stimuli such as their color, shape, identity, and meaning ( Mattingley,_Bradshaw,_&_Bradshaw,_1995;_McGlinchey-Berroth,_Milberg,_Verfaellie,_Alexander,_&_Kilduff,_1993_CITE)"
"These include a reluctance to respond to the left, even with the ipsilesional right hand ( Heilman,_Bowers,_Coslett,_Whelan,_&_Watson,_1985_CITE), and slowness in initiating leftward movements of the right hand towards visual targets in the left hemispace ( Mattingley,_Husain,_Rorden,_Kennard,_&_Driver,_1998_CITE)"
"Lesions of the right IPL that cause visual neglect also impair the ability to maintain visual attention over sustained temporal intervals ( Rueckert_&_Grafman,_1998_CITE), whether for visual or auditory attention ( Robertson_et al.,_1997_CITE)"
"ARTSCAN explanation of visual crowding ( Foley_et al.,_2012_CITE), and with it an explanation of the Koch_and_Tsuchiya_(2007)_CITE discussion of how subjects can attend to a location for many seconds and yet fail to see one or more attributes of an object at that location (see Section 2), follows from its analysis of how a surface-shroud resonance regulates both seeing and recognition of objects"
"Recent psychophysical experiments have also described circumstances where adding additional flankers can lead to a release from crowding; eg, Manassi,_Lonchampt,_Clarke,_and_Herzog_(2016)_CITE"
"That is the main point of the article by Grossberg,_Mingolla,_and_Ross_(1994)_CITE whose title A neural theory of attentive visual search: Interactions of boundary, surface, spatial, and object representations emphasized the role of these four kinds of processes"
"Further experimental and modeling studies of crowding and visual search, and their interactions, from this perspective are much to be desired and, as illustrated by the modeling simulations of Fazl_et al._(2009)_CITE and Foley_et al._(2012)_CITE, need to include surface-shroud resonances as one part of a unifying theory."
"In one striking classical example, alternating displays of an original and a modified scene are separated in time by brief blank fields ( Rensink_et al.,_1997_CITE)"
"This property is called contrast normalization ( Grossberg,_1973,_1980;_Heeger,_1992_CITE)"
"The third important factor is that transient scenic changes automatically attract spatial attention (eg, Corbetta_&_Shulman,_2002;_Yantis_&_Jonides,_1990_CITE), a property that has also been explained within the 3D FORMOTION model"
"Motion-induced blindness ( Grindley_&_Townsend,_1965;_Ramachandran_&_Gregory,_1991_CITE) is closely related to change blindness"
"In response to any moving target, the visual boundary system also triggers an inhibitory rebound after a boundary moves by in order to prevent uncontrolled boundary persistence, and consequent perceptual smearing, or streaking, in its wake ( Wallis_&_Arnold,_2009_CITE)"
"A series of neural modeling studies have developed the 3D FORMOTION model (eg, Baloch_&_Grossberg,_1997;_Berzhanskaya_et al.,_2007;_Francis_&_Grossberg,_1996b;_Grossberg,_1991,_2014_CITE), to explain and predict psychophysical and neurobiological data about how these streams work, and interact"
"For example, the effects of reversibly cooling V2 on recorded cell properties in MT that were reported by Ponce,_Lomber,_and_Born_(2008)_CITE were anticipated by earlier 3D FORMOTION model predictions ( Grossberg,_1991_CITE)"
"Even more recent simultaneous recording methods have demonstrated widespread sharing of cue selectivities across cortical streams ( Siegel,_Buschman,_&_Miller,_2015_CITE)"
"The prediction that surface-shroud resonances support conscious percepts of visual qualia is consistent with many additional FACADE and 3D LAMINART model simulations of the parametric properties of consciously seen surfaces during 3D vision and figure-ground perception, including percepts of random dot stereograms ( Fang_&_Grossberg,_2009_CITE); Necker cubes ( Grossberg_&_Swaminathan,_2004_CITE); unique and bistable transparency ( Grossberg_&_Yazdanbakhsh,_2005_CITE); Panum limiting case, dichoptic masking, the Venetian blind illusion, and da Vinci stereopsis ( Cao_&_Grossberg,_2005;_Grossberg_&_Howe,_2003;_Grossberg_&_McLoughlin,_1997_CITE); texture segregation ( Bhatt_et al.,_2007;_Grossberg_&_Pessoa,_1998_CITE); 3D shape-from-texture ( Grossberg_et al.,_2007_CITE); visual persistence ( Francis_&_Grossberg,_1996a;_Francis_et al.,_1994_CITE); Bregman Kanizsa figure-ground separation, Kanizsa stratification, and the Munker White, Benary cross, and checkerboard percepts ( Kelly_&_Grossberg,_2000_CITE); the McCullough effect ( Grossberg,_Hwang,_&_Mingolla,_2002_CITE); the watercolor illusion ( Pinna_&_Grossberg,_2005_CITE); and illumination-discounted and anchored brightness and color percepts ( Grossberg_&_Hong,_2006;_Grossberg_&_Todorovic,_1988;_Hong_&_Grossberg,_2004_CITE)"
"The example shown in Fig_20 illustrates the simple case where a rectangular boundary is viewed in depth, but only its left vertical boundary can be seen by both eyes, as often happens in examples of daVinci stereopsis when distant surfaces are partially occluded by nearer surfaces to different extents in the two eyes ( Nakayama_&_Shimojo,_1990_CITE)"
"They have used this extended model to simulate neurophysiological data of Li_and_DiCarlo_CITE ( 2008_CITE; see also Li_&_DiCarlo,_2010_CITE) which show that features from different objects can be merged through learning within a single invariant IT category when monkeys are presented with an object that is swapped with another object during an eye movement to foveate the original object"
"These explanations include how spatial attention can increase the perceived brightness of a surface (see Fig_14; Carrasco,_Penpeci-Talgar,_&_Eckstein,_2000;_Reynolds_&_Desimone,_2003_CITE), how the eyes can prefer to move within the same object for awhile (see Section 12.5; Theeuwes,_Mathot,_&_Kingstone,_2010_CITE), how predictive remapping of eye position occurs (see Section 12.6; Duhamel,_Colby,_&_Goldberg,_1992;_Gottlieb,_Kusunoki,_&_Goldberg,_1998;_Melcher,_2007_CITE), and what sort of category invariance can be learned, given the limitations that are imposed by the cortical magnification factor ( Grossberg_et al.,_2011;_Zoccolan,_Kouh,_Poggio,_&_DiCarlo,_2007_CITE)"
"These target positions hereby control shifts of spatial attention across an attended object, and have properties that Cavanagh,_Hunt,_Afraz,_and_Rolfs_(2010)_CITE have called attention pointers ( Fig_20)."
"Predictive remapping has been used to interpret neurophysiological data about how parietal representations are updated by intended eye movements ( Duhamel_et al.,_1992;_Gottlieb_et al.,_1998;_Mathot_&_Theeuwes,_2010;_Melcher,_2007,_2008,_2009;_Saygin_&_Sereno,_2008;_Sommer_&_Wurtz,_2006;_Tolias_et al.,_2001;_Umeno_&_Goldberg,_1997_CITE) by using gain fields ( Andersen,_Essick,_&_Siegel,_1985,_1987;_Andersen_&_Mountcastle,_1983;_Deneve_&_Pouget,_2003;_Fazl_et al.,_2009;_Gancarz_&_Grossberg,_1999;_Grossberg_&_Kuperstein,_1986;_Pouget,_Dayan,_&_Zemel,_2003_CITE); see LIP in Fig_17"
"The 3D ARTSCAN model ( Grossberg_et al.,_2014_CITE) predicts how this happens by augmenting the ARTSCAN machinery in Figs_19 22 with additional processes of predictive remapping"
"How, then, do we know what a familiar object is when we see it? ART proposes that this happens because both resonances interact with shared visual cortical areas, such as V4, and can thus synchronize with each other, often with gamma oscillations ( Fries,_2009;_Grossberg_&_Versace,_2008_CITE)."
"Indeed, What and Where/How streams for auditory processing have also been described (eg, Rauschecker,_1998;_Rauschecker_&_Tian,_2000_CITE), with a ventral pathway into anterior temporal cortex that carries out identification of complex auditory patterns or objects, and a dorsal pathway into posterior parietal cortex that carries out spatial processing ( Fig_26 )"
"An outflow representation of the current hand/arm position, called the present position vector, or P, is subtracted from the target position to compute a difference vector, or D ( Georgopoulos,_Kalaska,_Caminiti,_&_Massey,_1982;_Georgopoulos,_Schwartz,_&_Kettner,_1986_CITE) that codes the direction and distance that the hand/arm needs to move to reach the target"
"A volitional GO signal, or G, from the basal ganglia ( Prescott,_Gurney,_&_Redgrave,_2003_CITE) gates, or multiplies, the difference vector to determine which arm will move and the speed with which it will approach the target position"
"The Vector Integration to Endpoint, or VITE, model ( Fig_27, left panel; Bullock_&_Grossberg,_1988_CITE) modeled these processes to clarify how the Three S of reaching are carried out: the flexible choice of motor Synergies, and their Synchronous performance at variable Speeds"
"A refinement that sheds the most light on auditory visual homologs of reaching and speaking circuits is called the DIRECT model ( Bullock,_Grossberg,_&_Guenther,_1993_CITE), which also learns through a circular reaction"
"During the development of the DIRECT model by Bullock_et al._(1993)_CITE, an evolutionary rationale was noted for why both the hand/arm and speech articulator systems may use similar, indeed homologous, neural circuits; namely, eating preceded speech during human evolution ( MacNeilage,_1998_CITE), and skillful eating requires movements that coordinate hand/arm and mouth/throat articulators, including motor-equivalent solutions for reaching and chewing"
"DIVA showed how babbled speech articulator movements may be used to learn volitionally controlled speech sounds that are capable of motor-equivalent articulator movements such as those that occur during coarticulation ( Guenther,_1995;_Guenther,_Hampson,_&_Johnson,_1998_CITE)."
"As with the VITE and DIRECT models, the DIVA model has been progressively developed, leading to an anatomical interpretation of model computational stages in terms of identified anatomical regions and their functions ( Fig_28, right panel; eg, Guenther,_Ghosh,_&_Tourville,_2006_CITE)"
"As in the case of visual neglect (Section 10.5), auditory neglect can be produced by lesions of the IPL, particularly in the right hemisphere (eg, Bellmann_et al.,_2001;_Clarke_&_At,_2013;_Driver_&_Mattingley,_1998;_Gutschalk_&_Dykstra,_2015;_Marshall,_2001_CITE)"
"It also often includes impairment in maintaining sustained attention ( Robertson_et al.,_1997_CITE), as reflected by impaired auditory target detection during continuous stimulation"
"The process that forms auditory streams is called auditory scene analysis ( Bregman,_1990_CITE)"
"The auditory continuity illusion ( Bregman,_1990_CITE) illustrates ART properties during auditory streaming"
"These are properties of the ART Matching Rule ( Fig_12) acting through time at the level of auditory scene analysis, and modeled by the ARTSTREAM model ( Fig_30 ; Grossberg,_Govindarajan,_Wyse,_&_Cohen,_2004_CITE)"
"Many examples of such lags exist, including classical data of Libet,_Gleason,_Wright,_and_Pearl_(1983)_CITE on the cortical readiness potential."
"What is learned during an auditory scene analysis process like the auditory continuity illusion? The ARTSTREAM model of auditory streaming ( Fig_30), including its SPINET model front end (the peripheral processing layers plus a single spectral stream layer and the corresponding pitch summation layer in Fig_30; Cohen,_Grossberg,_&_Wyse,_1995_CITE), proposes that spectral-pitch resonances occur between logarithmic spectral representations of sound frequency patterns and recognition categories that code for pitch"
"Timbres have more complex spatio-temporal spectral distributions that can also include frequency sweeps, different onset and offset times, and different relative amplitudes in different frequency bands ( Grey,_1977;_McAdams,_2013_CITE)"
"The characteristic sounds of voices and instruments (eg, Belin,_Zatorre,_Lafaille,_Ahad,_&_Pike,_2000;_Goldinger,_1996;_Palmeri,_Goldinger,_&_Pisoni,_1993_CITE) may be stored and categorized in this way, although their different spectral properties may cause their adaptive filters to selectively activate different cortical areas (eg, Belin_et al.,_2000;_Fecteau,_Armony,_Joanette,_&_Belin,_2004_CITE)"
"A stream-shroud resonance is proposed to play a similar role in sustaining auditory spatial attention and conscious auditory quality, and problems with sustained auditory attention, say due to a parietal lesion, can cause unilateral auditory neglect (eg, Robertson_et al.,_1997_CITE)."
"The position of auditory sources is computed from interaural time differences (ITD) and interaural level differences (eg, Bronkhorst_&_Plomp,_1988;_Darwin_&_Hukin,_1999;_Rayleigh,_1907_CITE)"
"As a result, auditory spatial attention in humans does not appear to have a map structure ( Kong_et al.,_2012_CITE), but rather seems to be embodied by an opponent process whose neurons are tuned to (eg) ITDs ( Magezi_&_Krumbholz,_2010_CITE)"
"In this way, an auditory stream can resonate in a spectral-pitch-and-timbre resonance for auditory recognition, while a stream-shroud resonance supports conscious hearing, and both resonances synchronize via their shared spectral representations, analogous to what happens during vision (Section 13), along the way explaining data like the Deutsch_(1975)_CITE scale illusion"
"A more recent name for this class of models is competitive queuing ( Houghton,_1990_CITE)"
"When an Item-and-Order working memory can store repeated items in a sequence, it is called an Item Order Rank working memory ( Bradski,_Carpenter,_&_Grossberg,_1994;_Grossberg_&_Pearson,_2008;_Silver_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Item Order Rank working memories, including the role of primacy gradients in correct list storage and recall, are supported by psychophysical and neurophysiological data (eg, Averbeck,_Chafee,_Crowe,_&_Georgopoulos,_2002;_Farrell_&_Lewandowsky,_2002;_Grossberg_&_Pearson,_2008;_Page_&_Norris,_1998;_Silver_et al.,_2011_CITE)."
"Phonemic restoration ( Warren_&_Sherman,_1974_CITE) illustrates the operation of ART mechanisms during speech perception in much the same way as the auditory continuity illusion represents them during auditory streaming"
"A variation of this experiment in which a reduced set of spectral components is used in the noise leads to hearing a correspondingly degraded consonant sound ( Samuel,_1981a,_1981b_CITE)."
"What properties recommend Item-and-Order working memories more than other possible alternatives, over and beyond their broad explanatory and predictive range? Grossberg_(2003b,_2013b)_CITE, Grossberg_and_Pearson_(2008)_CITE, and Grossberg_and_Kazerounian_(2016)_CITE review the hypothesis, first proposed in Grossberg_(1978a)_CITE, that Item-and-Order working memories satisfy two postulates which ensure that speech and language can be learned in a stable way through time: the LTM Invariance Principle and the Normalization Rule"
"These properties of competitive normalization, rehearsal waves, and self-inhibitory feedback have all been supported by psychological and neurophysiological data, as well as by model simulations (eg, Boardman_&_Bullock,_1991;_Grossberg_&_Pearson,_2008;_Silver_et al.,_2011_CITE)."
"Various psychophysical experiments have also successfully tested this prediction during speech perception (eg, Auer_&_Luce,_2008;_Goldinger_&_Azuma,_2003;_Luce_&_McLennan,_2008;_McLennan_&_Luce,_2005;_McLennan,_Luce,_&_Charles-Luce,_2003;_Vitevitch_&_Luce,_1999_CITE)."
"Because of this shared design, it becomes easier to understand how language in young children can begin to develop in a way that parallels the motor behaviors of adult teachers during mutual play ( Bruner,_1975_CITE), or how sign language by hearing adults can coordinate signing with speaking ( Neville_et al.,_2002_CITE)"
"At the time that this circuit was published ( Cohen,_Grossberg,_&_Stork,_1988_CITE), it was not yet understood how speaker normalization might occur, so these acoustic features were simply said to be invariant ; that is, speaker-normalized at the model Invariant Feature Detectors level"
"The motor-to-auditory selection process mechanistically explicates the motor theory of speech perception ( Galantucci,_Fowley,_&_Turvey,_2006;_Liberman_&_Mattingly,_1985_CITE)."
"The Neural Normalization Network, or NormNet, model ( Ames_&_Grossberg,_2008_CITE) proposes that speaker normalization specializes the same kinds of neural mechanisms that are used to form auditory streams"
"The most familiar example of strip maps are ocular dominance columns in visual cortical area V1 that are sensitive to inputs from one eye at each position, but whose constituent cells respond selectively to differently oriented visual features at that position ( Grossberg_&_Seitz,_2003;_Hubel_&_Wiesel,_1968_CITE)"
"Strip maps have also been used to model how place value numbers may be learned by human brains ( Grossberg_&_Repin,_2003_CITE)"
"This proposal clarifies how speaker normalization can transform auditory signals, right after they are separated into separate streams, for purposes of speech and language classification and meaning extraction, yet how the frequency content of the streams can be preserved for purposes of speaker identification in a separate processing stream, as illustrated in the ARTSPEECH architecture ( Fig_33, right panel) of Ames_and_Grossberg_(2008)_CITE"
"Consistent with this expectation, harmonics are more important during auditory streaming than during phonetic perception ( Remez,_2003;_Remez,_Pardo,_Piorkowski,_&_Rubin,_2001;_Remez,_Rubin,_Berns,_Pardo,_&_Lang,_1994_CITE)."
NormNet was tested by speaker-normalizing and learning steady-state vowel categories from the Peterson_and_Barney_(1952)_CITE database with an accuracy similar to that of human listeners
"The brain auditory system includes sustained cells that are sensitive to particular frequencies over time, and transient cells that are sensitive to FM sweeps across multiple frequencies at a particular rate and direction (eg, Britt_&_Starr,_1976;_Delgutte_&_Kiang,_1984a,_1984b,_1984c;_Mendelson,_Schreiner,_Sutter,_&_Grasse,_1993;_M ller,_1983;_Pickles,_1988;_Rhode_&_Smith,_1986a,_1986b;_Sachs_&_Young,_1979;_Tian_&_Rauschecker,_1984;_Young_&_Sachs,_1979_CITE)"
"Several experiments have reported such asymmetric vocalic context effects from T to S, but not conversely ( Kunisaki_&_Fujisaki,_1977;_Mann_&_Repp,_1980_CITE), and psychophysical experiments support the importance of consonant/vowel ratio as a cue for voicing in English (eg, Port_and_Dalby_(1982)_CITE)."
"PHONET was tested by quantitatively simulating how, using CV syllables such as /ba/ and /wa/, an increase in duration of vowel /a/ can switch the percept of the preceding consonant from /w/ to /b/ ( Miller_&_Liberman,_1979_CITE)"
"A change in frequency extent (total frequency change), but not rate, can also influence the /b/-/w/ distinction ( Schwab,_Sawusch,_&_Nusbaum,_1981_CITE)"
A classical example of this phenomenon was reported by Repp_(1980)_CITE
"Persistent activity-dependent transmitter release during resonance inactivates, habituates, or depresses them ( Grossberg,_1972b,_1980_CITE), thereby weakening the feedback signals until the resonance collapses"
"How do rate-dependent integration and rate-invariant working memory enter this story? This can be seen from finer aspects of the Repp_(1980)_CITE data, which measured three category boundary curves for each of the VC-CV syllables [ib]-[ga] and [ib]-[ba] ( Fig_34, right column): A low anchor condition had its distribution of silent intervals skewed to be shorter, a high anchor condition had them skewed to be longer, and a no anchor condition had no skew"
The comparison between resonant fusion and resonant reset that plays an important role in explaining the Repp_(1980)_CITE data on category boundary shifts also helps to explain data about the way in which masking stimuli can influence error rates and reaction times during lexical decision tasks
"In a classical set of experiments, Schvaneveldt_and_McDonald_(1981)_CITE presented word and non-word targets after semantically related (R), neutral (N), or unrelated (U) word primes"
"A similar combination of mechanisms was used to explain data about word frequency effects in recognition and recall ( Underwood_&_Freund,_1970_CITE), notably why forced choice recognition of (old-new) word pairs leads to more errors for old high-frequency words paired with new high-frequency words (H-H) than for old low-frequency words paired with new low-frequency words (L-L), yet more errors occur for old low-frequency words paired with new high-frequency words (L-H) than for the converse (H-L)"
"Various other lexical decision and word frequency data have been explained using ART concepts (eg, Dunbar,_2012_CITE; Glotin_et al.,_2010_CITE; McLennan_et al.,_2003;_Vitevitch_&_Donoso,_2011_CITE)."
"This example uses the LIST PARSE model ( Fig_35 ; Grossberg_&_Pearson,_2008_CITE) to illustrate how multiple processing stages are coordinated to enable variable-rate production from rate-invariant working memory and list chunking networks"
"Such volitional signals play a critical role in opening cognitive and motoric gates, which is necessary to enable the corresponding processes to unfold ( Alexander,_DeLong,_&_Strick,_1986;_Graybiel,_1997_CITE), notably in self-initiated behaviors ( Levy_&_Dubois,_2006;_Taniwaki_et al.,_2006_CITE)"
"Subsequent neurophysiological data of Buschman_and_Miller_(2007)_CITE supported this prediction by describing such a parietal prefrontal resonance during movement control, and Pasupathy_and_Miller_(2004)_CITE additionally described different time courses of activation in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia that are consistent with how basal ganglia-mediated gating of prefrontal cortex occurs in TELOS"
"This demonstration of how the basal ganglia control planning, choice, and performance of sequences is relevant to speech and language, and thus to the timed read-out of sensory expectations that will be matched during conscious hearing, due both to the fact that all linguistic, spatial, and motor working memories have a similar design (Section 16.4), and to the fact that all basal ganglia loops have a homologous anatomical organization ( Alexander_et al.,_1986_CITE)"
"This article does not include a comprehensive analysis of rhythm (eg, Ackermann,_2008;_Deutsch,_2013;_Fraisse,_1982;_Krumhansl,_2000;_Ladefoged_&_Disner,_2012_CITE), notably the role of beat in music"
"On the other hand, it does propose how parallel neural mechanisms for rate-invariant and speaker-normalized representations of speech, and for pitch-dependent and rhythm-dependent speech intonation ( Ladefoged_&_Disner,_2012_CITE), may interact to achieve online sequencing of syllables into fast, smooth, and rhythmically organized larger utterances (Ackerman, 2008, p_265), including how these several kinds of information are learned, stored, and combined during fluent performance and conscious awareness thereof"
"These neural mechanisms and their design principles extend and complement the discoveries of processing streams, components, and their interactions that have been already been proposed (eg, Armony,_Aube,_Angulo-Perkins,_Peretz,_&_Concha,_2015;_Norman-Haignere,_Kanwisher,_&_McDermott,_2015;_Rauschecker_&_Scott,_2009;_Rauschecker_&_Tian,_2000;_Sleve_&_Okada,_2015_CITE)."
"I like to call this property factorization of order and rhythm ( Grossberg,_1986_CITE) for the following reasons: The speech items and their order can be stored in a rate-invariant Item Order Rank working memory (Section 16)"
"Learning also goes on throughout life of a parallel circular reaction that links learned spectral-pitch-and-timbre categories for the recognition of heard sounds ( Table 2), which are not speaker-normalized, to the motor synergies that control the pitches generated by the vocal folds ( Sundberg,_1977_CITE)"
"Neural models of cognitive emotional resonances began with the articles of Grossberg_(1971,_1972a,_1972b)_CITE and Grossberg_(1975)_CITE at a time when there was a major split between studies of cognition, as exemplified by the work of Chomsky_(1957)_CITE in linguistics, and of emotion, as exemplified by the work of Skinner_(1938)_CITE on instrumental conditioning"
"Instead, cognition and emotion studies were often antagonistic to each other, as illustrated by the critique of Skinner behaviorism in Chomsky_(1959)_CITE"
"Such divided concepts of cognition and emotion have persisted during many historical periods, as described in the book Wittgenstein Vienna ( Janik_&_Toulmin,_1996_CITE)"
"This kind of cognitive emotional resonance was first predicted by the Cognitive-Emotional-Motor, or CogEM, model ( Fig_36; Grossberg,_1971,_1972a,_1972b,_1982,_1984b_CITE) and was used to quantitatively explain and simulate in these and later articles parametric properties of many cognitive emotional data (eg, Grossberg_&_Gutowski,_1987;_Grossberg_&_Levine,_1987_CITE; Grossberg_&_Schmajuk,_1987_CITE)"
"To this end, further developments of the CogEM model, such as the Matching Objects to Internal Values Triggers Option Revaluations, or MOTIVATOR, model ( Fig_37 ; ( Dranias,_Grossberg,_&_Bullock,_2008;_Grossberg,_Bullock,_&_Dranias,_2008_CITE)), proposed how the amygdala/hypothalamus and basal ganglia carry out complementary roles during reinforcement learning, and simulated neurophysiological data about inferotemporal, amygdala, orbitofrontal, and hypothalamic cell dynamics during the learning process, including the discharge dynamics of known cell types that predict saccadic reaction times and CS-dependent changes in systolic blood pressure, while simulating data about food-specific satiety, Pavlovian conditioning, reinforcer devaluation, and simultaneous visual discrimination."
"Many experiments have supported the prediction that drive-sensitive value category cells are found in the amygdala (eg, Aggleton,_1993;_LeDoux,_1993,_1996,_2012;_Pessoa,_2008;_Pessoa_&_Adolphs,_2010_CITE)"
"Multimodal amygdala cells that are hunger- and satiety-selective ( Muramoto,_Ono,_Nishijo,_&_Fukuda,_1993;_Yan_&_Scott,_1996_CITE) and respond in proportion to the value of a food reward have been extensively studied in the primate and rodent ( Nishijo,_Ono,_&_Nishino,_1988;_Toyomitsu,_Nishijo,_Uwano,_Kuratsu,_&_Ono,_2002_CITE)"
"Neurobiological experiments have supported the prediction that an object value category in orbitofrontal cortex receives a direct input from an object category in a sensory cortex, and indirect incentive motivational inputs from the amygdala (eg, Barbas,_1995_CITE), and that the strength of the incentive motivational input determines how vigorously an object value representation is activated in response to its object category input (eg, Baxter,_Parker,_Lindner,_Izquierdo,_&_Murray,_2000;_Rolls,_1999,_2000;_Schoenbaum,_Setlow,_Saddoris,_&_Gallagher,_2003_CITE)"
"The survival circuit concept of LeDoux_(2012,_p._653)_CITE integrates ideas about emotion, motivation, reinforcement, and arousal in the effort to understand how organisms survive and thrive by detecting and responding to challenges and opportunities in daily life"
"Such larger systems have been embodied in adaptive mobile robots; eg, Baloch_and_Waxman_(1991)_CITE."
"For example, hypoactivity of amygdala or orbitofrontal cortex can prevent a cognitive emotional resonance from occurring, thereby causing failures in Theory of Mind processes ( Baron-Cohen,_1989;_Perner,_Frith,_Leslie,_&_Leekam,_1989_CITE) in both autism and schizophrenia ( Grossberg,_2000b;_Grossberg_&_Seidman,_2006_CITE)"
"Deficiencies in Theory of Mind are not, however, sufficient to explain all aspects of autistic development and behavior, as Grossberg_and_Seidman_(2006)_CITE review."
"The ARTSCAN Search model ( Figs_17 and 18; Chang_et al.,_2014_CITE) proposes how this may happen."
"ARTSCAN Search was tested by learning to recognize and search for CalTech 101 images of natural objects in scenes that contain non-overlapping objects, as well as by simulating reaction times measured in human search tasks (eg, Brown_&_Denney,_2007_CITE)"
"Various other studies have linked consciousness and conditioning ( Gabrieli_et al.,_1995;_McGlinchey-Berroth,_Brawn,_&_Disterhoft,_1999;_McGlinchey-Berroth,_Carrillo,_Gabrieli,_Brawn,_&_Disterhoft,_1997_CITE)"
"For example, trace conditioning is facilitated by conscious awareness in normal control subjects, whereas delay conditioning is not, and amnesics with bilateral hippocampal lesions perform at a success rate similar to unaware controls for both delay and trace conditioning ( Clark,_Manns,_&_Squire,_2001_CITE)"
"Amnesics were unaware of experimental contingencies, and poor performers on trace conditioning ( Clark_&_Squire,_1998_CITE)."
"The nSTART, or neurotrophic Spectrally Timed ART, model ( Fig_40 ; Franklin_and_Grossberg_(2008,_2016)_CITE) simulates these experimental results by embedding the CogEM model into a larger learning circuit that includes the hippocampus"
"The hippocampus in this model includes a circuit for adaptively timed learning, called a spectral timing circuit in the earlier START model ( Grossberg_&_Merrill,_1992,_1996;_Grossberg_&_Schmajuk,_1989_CITE)"
"The existence of a hippocampal spectral timing circuit that can support learning across CS US temporal gaps is supported by psychological data (eg, Gibbon,_1991;_Millenson,_Kehoe,_&_Gormenzano,_1977;_Smith,_1968_CITE) and neurophysiological data (eg, Berger_&_Thompson,_1978;_MacDonald,_Lepage,_Eden,_&_Eichenbaum,_2011_CITE), notably its Weber law property that larger inter-stimulus intervals between CS and US lead to learned response curves with broader variances ( Fig_41, top row), a property that is also called scalar timing in the psychological literature ( Gibbon,_1977_CITE), and has also been found in hippocampal neurophysiological data about time cells that together form a spectrum of differently timed cells that obey a Weber law ( MacDonald_et al.,_2011_CITE), as predicted by the START model."
"On the other hand, the hippocampus is indeed part of the brain system that supports episodic learning and memory ( Eichenbaum_&_Lipton,_2008_CITE)"
"Both spatial and temporal representations coexist in the hippocampus, and both space and time are combined in episodic memories ( Tulving,_1972_CITE)."
"This inhibition would not, however, occur in response to an unexpected non-occurrence because the spectral timing circuit would not be active then ( Grossberg_&_Merrill,_1992,_1996;_Grossberg_&_Schmajuk,_1989_CITE)"
"In addition to explaining data about normal delay and trace conditioning, the nSTART model explains and simulates many subtle data about how learning and memory consolidation are influenced by different brain lesions ( Franklin_&_Grossberg,_2016_CITE)"
"A great deal of additional experimental evidence for neural correlates of consciousness has been reported since 1990, but has typically led to theoretical conclusions that fail to make the crucial linking hypothesis between specific dynamical brain representations and specific conscious qualia (eg, Baars,_2005;_Dehaene,_2014;_Dennett,_1991_CITE; Edelman_&_Tononi,_2000_CITE; Koch,_Massimini,_Boly,_&_Tononi,_2016;_Tononi,_2004,_2015_CITE)."
"For example, the neural global workspace of Dehaene_(2014)_CITE, which builds upon the global workspace of Baars_(2005)_CITE, claims that consciousness is global information broadcasting within the cortex [to achieve] massive sharing of pertinent information throughout the brain (p"
"Continuing in the spirit of Edelman_and_Tononi_(2000)_CITE, Tononi_(2004)_CITE defined a scalar function , the quantity of consciousness available to a system as the value of a complex of elements"
"is the amount of causally effective information that can be integrated across the informational weakest link of a subset of elements Tononi_(2012,_2015)_CITE goes on to further develop postulates for this Integrated Information Theory (IIT) for physical systems that include consciousness, such as intrinsic existence, compositionality, information, integration, and exclusion"
"Dennett highly cited book called Consciousness Explained ( Dennett,_1991_CITE) argued against a Cartesian Theater model, a place in the brain where it all comes together and generates subjective judgments"
"Notable among them are Victor Lamme and his colleagues (eg, Keizer,_Hommel,_&_Lamme,_2015_CITE; Tsuchiya,_Wilke,_Frassle,_&_Lamme, 2016_CITE)"
It is sometimes used as an approximate model for tuberculosis and can also be used to model the common cold [1 3]_CITE
The SIS model is strictly speaking not applicable for tuberculosis as infection provides partial immunity to re-infection but it can be used as an approximate model [4]_CITE.
This is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single newly infected individual entering a disease-free population at equilibrium [5]_CITE
This model is discussed by Hethcote [6]_CITE and Brauer in Brauer et al [5]_CITE
Hethcote and Yorke [8]_CITE outline a series of mathematical models for gonorrhea
The latter issue is discussed by Lajmanovich and Yorke [9]_CITE and Nold [10]_CITE who introduce heterogeneity into this simple SIS epidemic model for gonorrhea.
Lipsitch [11]_CITE models vaccination against pneumococcus and his work is based on an SIS model
"In a series of three papers Greenhalgh et al [12,13]_CITE and Lamb et al [14]_CITE study SIS mathematical epidemic models for pneumococcus transmission where transmission depends on serotype and genetic multilocus sequence type (which is genetic material within the serotype), and the Ph.D"
theses of Lamb [15]_CITE and Weir [16]_CITE are based on SIS models for pneumococcus.
Another disease which can be modelled by using the SIS model is the common cold [1 3]_CITE
The common cold (rhinovirus) is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract which has symptoms such as sneezing and sore throat [17]_CITE
"Rhinovirus is the predominant cause of common cold, it is responsible for around 30 50% of colds each year [17]_CITE with over 100 known serotypes, thus making it impossible to produce a unifying vaccine [17,18]_CITE"
"Most importantly, exposure to one rhinovirus does not confer significant immunity against other serotypes [19]_CITE"
"Consequently, there have been papers that suggest that an SIS model would be suitable in analysing the behaviour of the common cold (eg [1 3]_CITE)."
One way to do this is outlined by Bailey [20]_CITE
"If we make the same assumption in a stochastic model then if pi(t)=P(Thereareexactlyiinfectedindividualsattimet)assuming that all events in the stochastic model occur according to a Markov process with rate the same as the corresponding rate in the deterministic model we can derive the differential equations satisfied by the probabilities pi( t) as (1.4)dp0dt=( + )p1(t), (1.5)dpidt= (i 1)(N i+1)pi 1 i(N i)pi+( + )(i+1)pi+1 ( + )ipi,1 i N 1, (1.6)dpNdt= (N 1)pN 1 ( + )NpN, [20]_CITE"
"Allen [21]_CITE and Allen [22]_CITE outline an alternative approach, namely to consider possible changes i in a small time interval t and then find the mean change E(( i) 2) for the time interval t and define (t,i)=E( i) t,V(t,i)=E( i)2 tandB(t,i)=V(t,i)."
Then an SDE is inferred for this process by similarities in the forward Kolmogorov equations between the discrete and continuous stochastic processes [22]_CITE (1.7)dI=( I(N I) ( + )I)dt+ I(N I)+( + )IdW.
McCormack and Allen [23]_CITE construct an SDE approximation similar to an SIS multihost epidemic model and explore the deterministic and stochastic models numerically
"For example, Norden [24]_CITE described the stochastic SIS model as a logistic population model and investigated the distribution of the extinction times both numerically and theoretically, while Cavender [25]_CITE treated the SIS model as a birth and death process"
"Kryscio and Lef vre [26]_CITE extended and combined the results mentioned in [24]_CITE and [25]_CITE, by working with the stochastic SIS logistic model"
Such an assumption is appropriate if the disease spreads rapidly in a short period of time and that disease-related deaths are insignificant in terms of their effect on the whole population [35]_CITE.
"For example, in the fourteenth century, the Black Death wiped out about 25% of the whole population of Europe, killing 25 million people [20]_CITE"
"These diseases were in the past but even now some countries are under constant threat from diseases with a high mortality rate such as malaria and HIV/AIDS for which the assumption of a constant population size is not appropriate [36,37]_CITE"
Another example of a mathematical model in which the population size is not a constant is given by Derrick and van den Driessche [38]_CITE.
For example in Hethcote and van den Driessche paper [39]_CITE they looked at an SIS epidemic model with varying population size and a time delay
Lahrouz and Settati [37]_CITE looked at the asymptotic properties of an SDE SIS epidemic model with standard incidence and variable population size where white vector noise and telegraph noise modelled by Markovian switching are included
Busenberg et al [40]_CITE focused on analysing the SIS model of a vertically transmitted disease with varying population size
Busenberg and van den Driessche [36]_CITE analysed global stability for an SIRS epidemic model with vital dynamics in a varying size population
Dalal et al [42]_CITE introduced environmental stochasticity into the disease transmission term in a model for AIDS and condom use with two distinct states
"In a second paper Dalal et al [43]_CITE introduce stochasticity into a deterministic model of internal HIV viral dynamics via the same technique of parameter perturbation into the death rate of healthy cells, infected cells and virus particles"
Gray et al [7]_CITE also study the SIS epidemic model with environmental stochasticity introduced into the disease transmission parameter
Another way to introduce stochasticity into deterministic models is telegraph noise where the parameters switch from one set to another according to a Markov switching process [44]_CITE
"The transmission term S( t) I( t) is more suitable for describing diseases in a closely packed community such as school or a large city where doubling the population size could arguably double the number of contacts [35,45]_CITE"
"However, there are many diseases such as gonorrhea and AIDS, where doubling the population size would not realistically have a significant effect on the number of contacts, and thus should vary with respect to the population size (eg [8]_CITE)"
"As a result, it is reasonable to assume that the per capita disease contact rate depends on the population size N [35,45,46]_CITE"
"There are various choices for ( N), for example Anderson and May [47]_CITE assume that ( N) is linearly proportional to N for small population size while Busenberg and van den Driessche [36]_CITE assume that ( N) does not depend on N"
"One important conclusion that Anderson [48]_CITE obtained is that the dependence of ( N) on N decreases for sufficiently large N( t), which further highlights the fact that the previous SIS epidemic model with transmission term S( t) I( t) might not be realistic if N( t) continues to increase in size with respect to time"
"(2.11) is a very specialised case (with k=0) of the mean-reverting square root process or Cox Ingersoll Ross model [49,50]_CITE"
It is easy to see that our SDE (2.13) is a special case of the SDE considered in the Mean reverting square root process mentioned by Mao [49]_CITE with parameters = =0 and =2
"Furthermore, since 2>2 , we could conclude from [49]_CITE that sup0 t For any given initial value N(0)=N0, the probability that the SDE (2.13) has a unique and nonnegative solution N( t) for all t 0 is one, ie, N( t) 0 a.s"
"The existence theorem mentioned in [51]_CITE (Theorem 2.2 in Chapter IV) holds for a d-dimensional stochastic process, as a result the existence of a (possibly explosive) solution for our two-dimensional SDE SIS model (2.12) and (2.13) (or (2.8) and (2.9)) follows directly"
"Consequently we will construct a localised version of the uniqueness proof mentioned in [51]_CITE and show that it can be extended to a one-dimensional SDE where the coefficients b(x,t, ):R R+ R and (x,t, ):R R+ R are time-dependent stochastic functions"
"As mentioned before, all biologically reasonable disease contact rates increase at most linearly with the number of individuals when the population size is small (eg [47,48]_CITE)"
The following is the localised version of the uniqueness theorem mentioned in [51]_CITE: Theorem 4.1Localised version of Uniqueness TheoremSuppose thatx:R+ R
"In other words, P( 0 Recall that the SDE model (2.13) is a special case of the mean-reverting square root process with zero drift coefficient and thus from [49]_CITE P(sup0 We shall show that P( 00"
"Recall that the SDE model (2.13) is a special case of the mean-reverting square root process with zero drift coefficient and thus from [49]_CITE P(sup0 For any given initial value I(0)=I0 (0,N), the solution to our two-dimensional SDE SIS model (2.12) and (2.13) , I( t), will reach zero with probability one in finite time and thus the disease will die out a.s"
"In our paper, we have decided to use the Milstein method instead of the simpler Euler Maruyama method which is commonly used in many papers, for example [7]_CITE"
A similar situation but examining the spread of Streptococcus pneumoniae with transmission due to genetic sequence type (part of the genetic material) is discussed by Greenhalgh et al [12]_CITE and we have taken some of their parameter values to use in our simulations
The per capita death rate is therefore =1104/wk = 9.615 10 3/wk = 1.37363 10 3/day [12]_CITE
"thesis Weir [16]_CITE deduces from a systematic review that = 0.02011/day, (1/ ) = 49.7 days"
"The basic reproduction number for pneumococcus is estimated to be 1.49 [54]_CITE, 1.4 [55]_CITE and 1.8 2.2 [56]_CITE so we take = 2.857 10 7/day corresponding to a basic reproduction number of 2.0"
"Heikkinen and J rvinen [17]_CITE, mentioned that the mean duration of the common cold is around 7 10 days"
"Sun et al [58]_CITE, calculated the estimated basic reproduction number of the common cold, R 0, in a dormitory to be between 0.7 1.6 depending on the number of people in each dormitory"
"According to statistics of WHO [59]_CITE the crude death rate per year per 1000 population in the UK was 8.9 in 2012, hence =0.000024384/day"
Allen [21]_CITE and Allen [22]_CITE discuss an SDE model which retains this assumption and this is a direct analogue of the deterministic SIS epidemic model
"Initially, the growing attention on Reverse Logistics (RL) and Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) issues originated with public awareness (discussed in Dowlatshahi,_2000_CITE)"
"For instance, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive (directive 2002/96/EC) became European law in 2003, which contains mandatory requirements on collection, recycling, and recovery for all types of electrical goods, with a minimum rate of 4 kilograms per head of population per annum ( Georgiadis_&_Besiou,_2010_CITE)"
"Finally, RL/CLSC is now a revenue opportunity for manufacturers instead of a cost-minimization approach ( Guide_&_Van_Wassenhove,_2009_CITE)"
"A supply chain, in its classical form (forward supply chain), is a combination of processes to fulfill customers requests and includes all possible entities like suppliers, manufacturers, transporters, warehouses, retailers, and customers themselves ( Chopra_and_Meindl,_2010_CITE)"
"(Another illustration of a generic form of closed loop supply chain is found in Beamon,_1999_CITE)."
"Regarding the recent definition of a closed-loop supply chain, we should mention the elevated description of CLSC based on current requirements found in Guide_and_Van_Wassenhove_(2009)_CITE"
"Some cover either RL or CLSC, and some are partial reviews with specific aims, for instance in JIT ( Chan,_Yin,_&_Chan,_2010_CITE) or reviewing network design models ( Chanintrakul,_Coronado_Mondragon,_Lalwani,_&_Wong,_2009_CITE)"
"Fang,_Cote,_and_Qin_(2007)_CITE studied the state of eco-industrial development in China"
"We find 143 papers in various journals with few publications (4 and fewer) in these fields; the list of journals in this category is illustrated in Appendix 1 (

"Other parameters regarded as nondeterministic can be different rates ( Chatfield_&_Pritchard,_2013;_Georgiadis_&_Athanasiou,_2010;_Kawa_&_Golinska,_2010;_Nativi_&_Lee,_2012;_Shankar_et_al.,_2008_CITE), delivery time ( Pishvaee & Torabi, 2010), lead-time ( Lieckens_&_Vandaele,_2007_CITE), transportation time ( Krishnamurthy,_Khorrami,_&_Schoenwald,_2008_CITE), waste generation ( Fonseca,_Garc a-S nchez,_Ortega-Mier,_&_Saldanha-da-Gama,_2010_CITE), environmental issues ( Wang & Hsu, 2010a; Wang & Hsu, 2010b), risk factors ( Lundin, 2012), and different weights ( Kannan,_2009;_Nukala_&_Gupta,_2007;_Pochampally_&_Gupta,_2008;_Tuzkaya,_G ls n,_&_ nsel,_2011_CITE)."
"Finally, based on various approaches of different studies, we divide the approaches into 13 categories: Conceptual and descriptive types of modeling (1), linear and mixed integer programming (MIP) (2), nonlinear programming methods (3), convex and concave programming (4), dynamic programming (5), queuing models (6), Markov decision process (7), graph theory (8), game theory (9), fuzzy logic (10), simulation modeling (11), multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches (12), and other approaches (13) like artificial neural network (ANN) ( Mazhar et al, 2007), piecewise interval programming ( Zhang, Liu, & Tu, 2011), dynamic regression models ( Carrasco-Gallego_&_Ponce-Cueto,_2009_CITE), statistical modeling ( Pati et al, 2010), robust Bayesian belief networks with interval probabilities ( Shevtshenko & Wang, 2009), engineering economics techniques ( Krikke,_2010_CITE), combining input output analysis and Laplace transforms ( Bogataj_&_Grubbstr m,_2013_CITE), theory of production frontier ( Lai_et_al.,_2013_CITE), institutional theory ( Ye et al, 2013), and novel neighborhood rough set approach ( Bai_&_Sarkis,_2013_CITE)."
"There is a substantial number of variables in the literature, generally divided into three main categories based on Chopra_and_Meindl_(2010)_CITE: RL/CLSC strategic decision variables: Designing decisions, like locations and capacities of facilities (configurations and structures), are made at this level"
"The paper of Chaabane,_Ramudhin,_and_Paquet_(2012)_CITE is suggested as one of the sustainable-closed-loop supply chain studies"
"Kim,_Goyal,_and_Kim_(2013)_CITE and Amin_and_Zhang_(2013)_CITE are two of the suggested papers in this direction."
"Some of these approaches can be pointed out as queuing models ( Lieckens_&_Vandaele,_2007_CITE), graph-based models, Markov decision process ( Ferguson,_Fleischmann,_&_Souza,_2008_CITE), piecewise interval programming ( Zhang, Liu et al, 2011), dynamic regression models ( Carrasco-Gallego_&_Ponce-Cueto,_2009_CITE), statistical approaches ( Pati et al, 2010), and interval mathematics ( Hasani_et_al.,_2012_CITE)."
"The researches of Hammond_and_Beullens_(2007),_Walther,_Schmid,_and_Spengler_(2008),_Du_and_Evans_(2008),_Chouinard,_D Amours,_and_A t-Kadi_(2008),_Feng,_Zhang,_and_Tang_(2013)_CITE, and Minner and Kiesm ller (2012) can be mentioned here."
"Some areas could be environmental decision variables ( Georgiadis_&_Besiou,_2010_CITE and Wang et al, 2011), quality-analysis decision variables ( Hern ndez_et_al.,_2011_CITE), and different transportation decision variables ( Chaabane_et_al.,_2012;_Lundin,_2012_CITE, and Paksoy, Bekta , & zceylan, 2011)."
"Installing and configuring network defence systems such as Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) provide an initial barrier to cyber attacks but the inclusion of personal devices and remote working has contributed to the de-perimeterisation of computer networks ( Burnap_and_Hilton,_2009_CITE), meaning that network level defences alone are not sufficient to defend against these new and emerging issues"
"Such an analysis could help identify cyber-attack patterns, the associated risks with different types of cyber-attacks and their assessment in terms of some numeric score to help a network administrator take appropriate responsive actions ( Kott_and_Arnold,_2013_CITE)"
"However, existing risk scoring and assessment mechanisms such as Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) ( First,_2015_CITE), CORAS ( Lund_et al.,_2011_CITE), ISO/IEC 27001:2013 ( ISO,_2013_CITE), etc., require subjective, human-based qualitative inputs, which could potentially lead to inaccurate (ambiguous) and inconclusive results"
"Further, presenting a holistic view of the organisation-wide risk, distributed over different segments of the network over time, is of much more importance than simply reporting static risk scores (generally achieved by simply summing up the reported vulnerabilities across the network and reporting this as a single numeric value) ( Kott_and_Arnold,_2013_CITE)."
"The model incorporated both the cause consequence relationships and the likelihoods of exploiting them for estimating security risks for an organisation based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) metrics ( First,_2015_CITE)"
"The study further proposed and developed a genetic algorithm for optimising administrators' objectives for mitigating risks ( Poolsappasit_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
Dantu_et al._(2004_CITE) used attack graphs to model network vulnerabilities and then deployed a Bayesian logic based probabilistic model for network risk assessment
Liu_and_Man_(2005_CITE) modelled potential attack paths using Bayesian networks and considered attack mechanisms and background knowledge of attackers for computing an optimal subset of potential attack paths
"The study involved near real-time analysis of the network data to identify a suitable security response for the identified intrusions using a Bayesian network ( Xie_et al.,_2010_CITE)"
"A dynamic Bayesian Network-based model, which incorporated the evolution of vulnerabilities over time in the attack graph, has been proposed by Frigault_et al._(2008_CITE)"
"The model derived its parameters from the widely used network values of CVSS ( First,_2015_CITE) and the attack graphs, and focused on supporting security monitoring in a dynamic network environment"
Dantu_et al._(2007_CITE) have performed a study to estimate and classify attack behaviour types based on survey results
"Dantu_et al._(2009_CITE) have hypothesised the relationship between network action sequence and attack behaviour, and proposed a 5-step model for detecting and estimating risk based on attack graphs and attacker behaviours"
"A service dependency graph based cost-sensitive intrusion-response system has been proposed to evaluate the three fundamental security principles: confidentiality, integrity and availability ( Kheir_et al.,_2010_CITE)"
"The model, being non-graph based in nature, uses an Observable Markov Decision Process to assess state of system assets from network security perspective (which can be normal, probing, under exploitation and compromised), selects a rational defence response for preserving security properties of a more secure system while considering potential cost factors ( Zhang_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"The study suggested several research directions to improve IRS, one of which was to improve the link between risk assessment and intrusion response ( Shameli-Sendi_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"A hierarchical task network planning model using a non-graph based approach was proposed by Mu_and_Li_(2010_CITE), which calculates risk thresholds by considering its positive and negative effects"
"A dependency attack graph based approach, wherein the dependency attack graph is systematically integrated with Hidden Markov Models, has been proposed for investigating system-level vulnerabilities using probabilistic relations by Wang_et al._(2013_CITE)"
"An attack graph based model for evaluating risk in a considered computer network has been proposed by Kanoun_et al._(2008_CITE), which computes risk by combining two major factors: potentiality and impact"
"Traditionally, two methods for risk assessment are generally used either the CORAS Method ( Lund_et al.,_2011_CITE) and/or the use of a standard-based management framework such as ISO/IEC 27001:2013 ( ISO,_2013_CITE)"
"The CORAS Method ( Lund_et al.,_2011_CITE) is a model-driven risk analysis approach that follows an 8-step methodology for threat and risk modelling"
"Similarly, a management framework for risk assessment and their potential mitigation has been provided by ISO/IEC 27001:2013 ( ISO,_2013_CITE), which requires continuous subjective input by the stakeholders for calculating potential risk to the considered network"
"These often lead to risk metrics which have a potentially misleading and ambiguous nature ( Kott_and_Arnold,_2013_CITE)"
"Lack of theoretical foundations for quantitative characterisation of risk, its distribution over different segments of a network as well as time, and empirical validation of risk metrics require better mechanisms for computing and modelling risk across a computer network ( Kott_and_Arnold,_2013_CITE)"
"Risk has been traditionally calculated as a product of likelihood of threats and impact on an organisation with both of the parameters depending on the subjective beliefs of the system administrator about the computer network of the organisation ( Poolsappasit_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"Our risk framework can be generalised for malicious data logs obtained from other commonly used network security software such as from IBM ( IBM,_2015_CITE), McAfee ( McAfee,_2015_CITE), Symantec ( Symantec,_2015_CITE), Sophos ( Sophos,_2015_CITE) and Zone Alarm ( ZoneAlarm,_2015_CITE)."
"The field was spawned from the dreams of Artificial Intelligence, though the reality has encompassed a far broader scope of study than originally envisioned at the Dartmouth Conference [2]_CITE"
"The debate over the definition of science versus engineering could form an entire article by itself, and an excellent example is to be found within this special issue [5]_CITE"
"In later a communication he states that only roughly speaking, unifiers are following the tradition of Descartes, diversifiers are following the tradition of Bacon [7]_CITE"
A controversial idea of the past century in philosophy has been the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements [8]_CITE
"Kant [8]_CITE referred to analytic statements as clarifying or explicating our knowledge, or in other words, making explicit what was once implicit"
A modern perspective on this divide is given by Jogalekar [9]_CITE.
In another communication [11]_CITE he recounts his discussions on Quantum ElectroDynamics with Richard P
"The only instance even vaguely like this (that I know of) is the Boosting family of algorithms the existence of which was predicted by studies in computational complexity theory [14]_CITE, and discovered later by Schapire [15]_CITE"
"The field of artificial intelligence underwent the ultimate diversification from the 1980s onward, documented well by Cristianini [16]_CITE"
"Looking back at the Dartmouth Conference [2]_CITE, the primary goal was to create intelligent beings, and it was imagined this was only a decade or so away"
"As stated eloquently by Langley [17]_CITE, too much diversification can also be bad for a field: diversification also has its dangers"
"Though this article is focused on Pattern Recognition, it is fair to note that similarly vague work appears in related communities [18]_CITE"
"One can only hope that further standards of reproducible research will infiltrate the community, and allow genuine progress rather than illusory [19]_CITE."
Kuhn [20]_CITE presents a treatise on the nature and reasons behind revolutions in scientific understanding
"He expands upon this view in a book titled The Sun, The Genome, and The Internet , [21]_CITE, discussing how tools are an equal (if not greater) influence on the recent revolutions in science"
Dyson has recently speculated [13]_CITE that the progress of artificial intelligence is fundamentally limited until critical new tools (analogue computing machines) are properly developed.
"Whilst we may never have a truly unified theory of inference , there are a number of technical elements of our field which could benefit from a little unification; in classic papers, Breiman [22]_CITE and Langley [17]_CITE present ideas along this line"
Breiman [22]_CITE discusses two cultures of statistical modelling: data modelling versus algorithmic modelling
"Langley [17]_CITE wrote a striking editorial for an issue of Machine Learning Journal, on the topic of unifying machine learning as it stood in the late 1980s"
"Can philosophy in general inform profitable new directions in PR research? Pelillo and Scantamburlo [25]_CITE present a post hoc example, discussing the essentialist viewpoint in philosophy"
"Pelillo and Scantamburlo [25]_CITE discuss how dissimilarity measures in PR sit in direct opposition to this philosophical view, in that an entity is best described by its relation (similarities) to other entities"
Dyson argued that both theories and tools drive scientific revolutions [21]_CITE
"It is likely however that we need both the forces of unification and diversification to move forward, summarised eloquently by Langley [17]_CITE, referencing Dyson: Just as the twin forces of gravity and pressure hold a star in dynamic equilibrium while generating energy, so the joint processes of diversification and unification can hold a science together while fostering progress."
"Further, it has been claimed that few forks are successful ( Ven_and_Mannaert,_2008_CITE)"
"Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising to see claims for that there must be a strong reason for developers to consider switching to a competing project ( Wheeler,_2007_CITE)"
"However, it has also been argued that forking has the capability of serving as an invisible hand of sustainability that helps open source projects to survive extreme events such as commercial acquisitions, as well as ensures that users and developers have the necessary tools to enable change rather than decay ( Nyman_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"Similarly, Brian Behlendorf, co-founder of Apache Software Foundation, states that the right to fork means that you don t have to have any tolerance for dictators, you don t have to deal with people who make bad technical decisions you can put the future into your own hands, and if you find a group of other people who agree with you, you can create a new project around it ( Severance,_2012_CITE)"
"Another argument is that code forking can positively impact on both governance and sustainability of OSS projects at the levels of the software, its community and business ecosystem ( Nyman_and_Lindman,_2013_CITE)"
"Secondly, there have been tensions within the OpenOffice.org project which finally led to the creation of the Document Foundation and the LibreOffice project ( Byfield,_2010;_Documentfoundation,_2013a_CITE)"
"Thirdly, the project has reached a certain quality in that it has been adopted for professional use in a variety of private and public sector organisations ( Lundell,_2011;_Lundell_and_Gamalielsson,_2011_CITE)"
"Fourthly, previous studies of the base project OpenOffice.org ( Ven_et_al.,_2007_CITE) and more recent studies of LibreOffice ( Gamalielsson_and_Lundell,_2011_CITE) show that there is widespread deployment in many organisations in a number of countries"
"Fifthly, previous results ( Gamalielsson_and_Lundell,_2011,_2012_CITE) and anecdotal evidence from an official spokesperson for the LibreOffice project ( Nouws,_2011_CITE) suggest significant activity in the LibreOffice community"
"Many companies need to preserve their systems and associated digital assets for more than 30 years ( Lundell_et_al.,_2011_CITE), and in some industrial sectors (such as avionics) even more than 70 years ( Blondelle_et_al.,_2012b;_Robert,_2006_CITE)"
"In such usage scenarios there will be problems if the commercial vendor of adopted proprietary software leaves the market with increased risks for long-term availability of both software and digital assets ( Lundell_et_al.,_2011_CITE)"
"This causes organisations to vary concerning different types of lock-in and inability to provide long-term maintenance of critical systems and digital assets ( Lundell,_2011_CITE)"
"This in turn may affect the future sustainability of communities ( Bonaccorsi_and_Rossi,_2006_CITE)"
"Such motivations are sometimes categorised into economic, social, and technological types of incentives ( Bonaccorsi_and_Rossi,_2006_CITE)"
"Earlier research also suggests that an effective structure of governance is a basis for healthy and sustainable OSS communities ( de_Laat,_2007_CITE)"
"Moreover, the community manager in an OSS project plays a key role for achieving an effective structure of governance ( Michlmayr,_2009_CITE)"
"It has been claimed that fair licensing of all contributions adds a strong sense of confidence to the security of the community ( Bacon,_2009_CITE)"
"( Engelfriet,_2010_CITE) To successfully master the art of establishing a long-term sustainable OSS community is a huge challenge"
"It has been claimed that forks are generally started when a number of developers do not agree with the general direction in which the project is heading ( Ven_and_Mannaert,_2008_CITE)"
"It has been claimed that in order to be considered a fork, a project should ( Robles_and_Gonzalez-Barahona,_2012_CITE): (1) have a new project name, (2) be a branch of the original OSS project, (3) have an infrastructure that is separated from the infrastructure of the original project, eg web site, mailing lists/forums, and SCM (Software Configuration Management system), (4) have a new developer community that is disjoint from the community of the original project, and (5) have a different structure of governance"
"There are also related concepts that are similar to OSS project forking such as ( Robles_and_Gonzalez-Barahona,_2012_CITE): cloning (which involves the design of a software system that mimics another system), branching (where source code is duplicated within an SCM, creating parallel threads of development), derivation (which involves the creation of a new software system that is based on an existing system and which is compatible with the existing system), and modding (where existing software is enhanced, typically by enthusiasts, by providing patches and extensions to the existing software)"
"Four different categories have been identified by Wheeler_(2007)_CITE: (1) the forked project dies (eg libc/glibc), (2) the forked project re-merges with the original project (eg gcc/ecgs), (3) the original project dies (eg XFree86/X.org), and (4) successful branching where both the original and forked project succeeds and typically have separate communities"
"A possible fifth outcome is that both the original and forked project dies ( Robles_and_Gonzalez-Barahona,_2012_CITE)."
"Three different phases of governance have been identified by de_Laat_(2007)_CITE: (1) spontaneous governance, (2) internal governance, and (3) governance towards outside parties"
"In the context of OSS projects, it has been shown that little research has been conducted on social processes related to conflict management and team maintenance ( Crowston_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"There are several open questions related to this, such as How is team maintenance created and sustained over time? ( Crowston_et_al.,_2012_CITE)"
"One of these studies focused on motivations for forking SourceForge.net hosted OSS projects ( Nyman_and_Mikkonen,_2011_CITE)"
"Another study surveyed a large number of OSS project forks with a specific focus on the temporal evolution of forks, reasons for forking, and outcomes of forks ( Robles_and_Gonzalez-Barahona,_2012_CITE)"
"A similar but more limited study focused on the motivations and impact of the fork mechanism in OSS projects ( Viseur,_2012_CITE)"
"Another study has a focus on code maintenance issues in forked projects in the BSD family of operating systems ( Ray_and_Kim,_2012_CITE)."
"Examples include a study on the total growth rate of OSS projects ( Deshpande_and_Riehle,_2008_CITE), and work on the evolution of social interactions for a large number of projects on SourceForge.net over time ( Madey_et_al.,_2004_CITE)"
"Another example is a study on survival analysis of OSS projects involving the application of different metrics based on the duration of thousands of projects in the FLOSSMETRICS database ( Samoladas_et_al.,_2010_CITE)"
"An example is a study on the Linux kernel based on Lehman's laws of software evolution, which involved the application of code oriented metrics over time ( Israeli_and_Feitelson,_2010_CITE)"
"A similar approach was used in a case study on the evolution of Eclipse ( Mens_et_al.,_2008_CITE)"
"Further, the growth of FreeBSD and Linux was studied and compared to earlier results on code evolution ( Izurieta_and_Bieman,_2006_CITE)"
"Another study on the topic of software evolution proposes a model of the Linux kernel life cycle ( Feitelson,_2012_CITE)."
"A somewhat different strand of research involves development and application of different kinds of statistical measures for estimation and prediction of the survivability ( Raja_and_Tretter,_2012;_Wang,_2012_CITE), success ( Crowston_et_al.,_2003,_2006;_Lee_et_al.,_2009;_Midha_and_Palvia,_2012;_Sen_et_al.,_2012;_Subramaniam_et_al.,_2009;_Wiggins_et_al.,_2009;_Wiggins_and_Crowston,_2010_CITE) and attractiveness ( Santos_et_al.,_2013_CITE) of OSS projects"
"Such measures may consider factors related to ( Wang,_2012_CITE): developer characteristics (eg user and developer effort, service quality, leadership and adherence to OSS ideology), software characteristics (eg license terms, targeted users, software modularity and quality), and community attributes (eg organisational sponsorship, financial support, trust and social network ties)"
"For example, case studies have been conducted on the Debian project involving quantitative investigations of evolution of maintainership and volunteer contributions over time ( Robles_et_al.,_2005;_Michlmayr_et_al.,_2007_CITE)"
"Another study involved an investigation of developer community interaction over time for Apache web server, Gnome and KDE using social network analysis ( Lopez-Fernandez_et_al.,_2006_CITE)"
"A similar study involved the projects Evolution and Mono ( Martinez-Romo_et_al.,_2008_CITE)"
"Case studies on the Nagios project ( Gamalielsson_et_al.,_2010_CITE), and TopCased & Papyrus projects ( Gamalielsson_et_al.,_2011_CITE) addressed community sustainability and evolution over time with a special focus on organisational influence"
"Other research partially focusing on community evolution are early case studies on large and well-known OSS projects including the Linux kernel ( Moon_and_Sproull,_2000_CITE), Gnome ( German,_2003_CITE), Apache web server ( Mockus_et_al.,_2002_CITE), Mozilla ( Mockus_et_al.,_2002_CITE), and FreeBSD ( Dinh-Trong_and_Bieman,_2005_CITE)."
"Further, there are no earlier reported in-depth studies on any of the three projects (LibreOffice, OpenOffice.org, and Apache OpenOffice) with a focus on the evolution of OSS project communities over time except for our own earlier studies on LibreOffice ( Gamalielsson_and_Lundell,_2011,_2012_CITE)"
"In a study on the process of participation in OSS communities, Shibuya_and_Tamai_(2009)_CITE compare the communities for the Writer tool in the OpenOffice.org project, MySQL server in the MySQL project, and GTK+ in the GNOME project"
"There is another study that also has a community focus but from an open user experience design perspective, rather than a community evolution perspective ( Bach_and_Carroll,_2010_CITE)"
"One such study focused on code evolution ( Rossi_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"In another study the maintenance process of the OpenOffice.org project was analysed using its defect management and version management systems ( Koponen_et_al.,_2006_CITE)"
"There are also studies focusing on issues related to migration, adoption, and deployment of OpenOffice.org ( Huysmans_et_al.,_2008;_Rossi_et_al.,_2006;_Ven_et_al.,_2010;_Seydel,_2009_CITE)."
"In our quantitative analysis we adopt and extend approaches from earlier studies ( Gamalielsson_et_al.,_2011;_Gamalielsson_and_Lundell,_2011,_2012_CITE)"
"The coding of interview data was conducted in a manner which follows Glaser's ideas on open coding ( Lings_and_Lundell,_2005_CITE)"
"The focus was on constant comparison: indicator to indicator, indicator to emerging concepts and categories ( Lings_and_Lundell,_2005_CITE)"
"The OO project was established as an OSS project on 13 October 2000 ( Openoffice,_2004_CITE)"
"Its initial release was on 1 October 2001 and the first stable version (v1.0) was released on 30 April 2002 ( Openoffice,_2002_CITE)"
"Initial development begun within StarDivision, a German based company that was acquired by Sun Microsystems in mid-1999 ( Crn,_1999_CITE)"
"OO was governed by its community council, which comprised OO community members who also created a charter for the establishment of the council ( Openoffice,_2013_CITE)"
"The Oracle corporation acquired Sun (and thereby also the OO project) on 27 January 2010 ( Oracle,_2010_CITE)"
"Oracle stopped support for commercial OpenOffice.org on 15 April 2011 ( Marketwire,_2011a_CITE)."
"The Document Foundation (TDF) was established on 28 September 2010 ( Linuxuser,_2010_CITE) under German jurisdiction"
"The first beta release of LO was provided on the same date ( Pclosmag,_2011_CITE)"
"TDF has as its mission to facilitate the evolution of the LO project, which is a fork from the OO project since the date of establishing TDF ( Documentfoundation,_2013a_CITE)"
"TDF commits itself to give everyone access to office productivity tools free of charge to enable them to participate as full citizens in the 21st century ( Documentfoundation,_2013b_CITE)"
"Besides from having strong support from volunteer contributors, LO is also receiving support from commercial companies including RedHat, Novell and Canonical ( Documentfoundation,_2013c_CITE)."
"Oracle donated the OO project to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) on 1 June 2011 ( Marketwire,_2011b_CITE)"
"The project was thereafter established as an (incubating) ASF project on 13 June 2011 after undergoing a proposal and voting process ( Apache,_2013a_CITE)"
"The first stable release of AOO (v3.4) was provided on 8 May 2012 ( Openoffice,_2012_CITE)"
"Apache OpenOffice became a top-level Apache project on 17 October 2012 ( Apache,_2013a_CITE)"
"The mission of ASF is to establish projects delivering freely available and enterprise-grade products that are of interest for large user communities ( Apache,_2013b_CITE)"
"We also note that IBM is an active supporter and contributor to the AOO project ( IBM,_2011_CITE)"
"Finally, we note that long before the establishment of the AOO project, researchers indicated that leadership and control in the OO project under Sun governance is remarkably similar to that of Apache ( Conlon,_2007_CITE)."
"On 25 January 2011 the Document Foundation (TDF) announced the first stable version of LO, which constitutes a fork from OO ( Documentfoundation,_2013a_CITE)"
(ie third phase governance according to the categorisation proposed by de_Laat_(2007)_CITE)
"A strong commitment of contributors over long time periods has been observed earlier in a study on the Debian project where it was observed that maintainers tend to commit to the project for long periods of time and that the mean life of volunteers in the project is probably larger than in many software companies, which would have a clear impact on the maintenance of the software ( Michlmayr_et_al.,_2007_CITE)"
"In acknowledging that our analysis of the AOO project is based on a significantly shorter time window than the LO project, we note that both projects have communities of committers larger than the vast majority of mature OSS programs ( Krishnamurthy,_2002_CITE)"
"Results concerning commitment with each project support findings from previous research which show that for OSS projects the bulk activity, especially for new features, is quite highly centralised ( Crowston_et_al.,_2012_CITE)."
"It is not uncommon that developers are simultaneously involved in more than one project ( Lundell_et_al.,_2010_CITE)"
"This has been recognised in previous research ( Lundell_et_al.,_2010_CITE)"
"This choice of Open Source license for the project has been referred to as adhering to a keep-open license ( Engelfriet,_2010_CITE)"
"Further, our results from respondents strongly support several of the motivational factors for individual participation in OSS projects that have been identified in earlier research ( Bonaccorsi_and_Rossi,_2006_CITE)"
"The importance of establishing a strong sense for the OSS community in the context of large global OSS projects is closely related to the importance of establishing a sense of teamness in global software development projects ( Lings_et_al.,_2007_CITE)"
"The importance of face to face meetings is recognised both in the contexts of inter-organisational collaboration in the field of global software engineering ( Lings_et_al.,_2007_CITE) and large globally distributed OSS projects analysed in this study"
"Further, from our analysis in this study we note that the importance of establishing a common vision for an OSS community relates to experiences in the context of global software engineering concerning the importance of gaining executive support from all the sites in a globally distributed software development project ( Paasivaara,_2011_CITE)."
"which was forked from NetBSD in 1995 and still has an active developer community ( Gmane,_2013_CITE)."
"For the base project analysed (OpenOffice.org), a governance structure has been established and the OpenOffice.org community was governed by its community council ( Openoffice,_2013_CITE)"
"Similarly, the investigated branch after the fork (LibreOffice) has also established a governance structure referred to as the Document Foundation ( Documentfoundation,_2013a_CITE)"
"We note that our observation indicates that the LibreOffice project may be an exception to the norm since previous research claims that there have been few successful forks in the past ( Ven_and_Mannaert,_2008_CITE)."
"Similar complex data occur in biological settings [18,40]_CITE where the interaction between genes forms a network and genes with shared features are in common groups"
"In this paper, we focus on social networks, where networks represent connections between people, and groups represent shared interests [47]_CITE."
"Reflecting the importance of understanding such data, which we call grouped network data, there have been a number of techniques proposed for visualizing it, such as [3,12,35]_CITE"
"Primacy is acknowledged by Collins et al [12]_CITE, who introduce the concept of spatial rights in respect of the fact that spatial positioning can be the most salient feature of possible visual encodings , backed up by [9]_CITE"
"EulerView [41]_CITE and SetNet, introduced in this paper, both assign primary spatial rights to the sets but SetNet refines the layout of the sets to account for the network structure"
"Bubble Sets [12]_CITE, KelpFusion [28]_CITE and LineSets [3]_CITE assign primary spatial rights to the network"
"We evaluate the effectiveness of all five techniques when performing common tasks, derived from [38]_CITE, that require both information from the networks and the sets"
These tasks build on taxonomies for network-only tasks [2]_CITE and set-only tasks [5]_CITE.
The SetNet software is available from [1]_CITE along with all of the study material and a video preview of our work
The following is a summary of two general Gestalt principles [26]_CITE as well as the related principle of well-matchedness [19]_CITE that apply to the evaluated visualization techniques.
Euler diagrams support the interpretation of grouping information since elements in a common set are located in the same region [31]_CITE.
"We summarize these results, presented as a series of layout guides by Blake et al [10]_CITE:"
Well-formed Draw Euler diagrams that are well-formed [37]_CITE
Smooth curves Draw Euler diagrams with smooth curves [7]_CITE.
Diverging lines Draw Euler diagrams with diverging lines which means that the crossing angle at points of curve intersection approaches 90 degrees [7]_CITE.
Shape Draw Euler diagrams with circles [10]_CITE
Symmetry Draw Euler diagrams with highly symmetrical curves [10]_CITE.
Shape discrimination Draw Euler diagrams such that the regions are discernable from the curves via their shape but not at the expense of symmetry [10]_CITE.
"The primary purpose of this section is to introduce and theoretically analyze the four techniques that we evaluated: EulerView [41]_CITE, Bubble Sets [12]_CITE, LineSets [3]_CITE, and KelpFusion [28]_CITE; they are illustrated in Fig_1"
"EulerView [41]_CITE uses closed curves to represent sets, assigning primacy to the sets"
Graph clusters are visualized with transparent hulls by Santamaria and Theron [39]_CITE
Itoh et al [24]_CITE proposed to overlay pie-like glyphs over the nodes in a graph to encode multiple categories
"A related class of techniques visualize grouping information over graphs using convex hulls, such as Vizster [22]_CITE"
"Riche and Dwyer introduced two Euler diagram-based techniques, ComEd and DupEd, designed to visualize sets using simple regions and to draw individual data elements as text-annotated nodes [35]_CITE"
"The use of rectangles and irregular curves could impose cognitive difficulties in perceiving the sets, as they might give the impression of different semantics [45]_CITE"
"These overlaps do not correspond to actual set intersections which impacts well-matchness properties, and might impair usability [37]_CITE"
It is possible to visualize grouped network data using ComEd and DupEd by drawing edges between the nodes [35]_CITE
"An incremental constrained graph layout, IPSep-CoLa [14]_CITE, has been employed to create such a visualization by defining the grouping of the nodes into sets as constraints on the graph layout"
"Further techniques for visualizing similar data are described in [18,40,44]_CITE and a recent survey on set visualizations [5]_CITE."
"Alper et al [3]_CITE evaluate LineSets as compared to Bubble Sets with three categories of grouped network data: 50 items, three sets and five set intersections; 100 items, four sets and 10 set intersections; and 200 items, five sets and 30 set intersections"
Meulemans et al evaluated KelpFusion against both LineSets and Bubble Sets [28]_CITE
"A further related study has been conducted to compare four techniques for displaying group information over graphs [25]_CITE: coloured nodes, Bubble Sets, LineSets and GMap [17]_CITE"
"In [25]_CITE, each node belonged to only one group and, in addition, the groups were all disjoint"
"To visualize the sets, SetNet builds on an Euler diagram drawing technique [42]_CITE, called iCircles"
"This is a standard spring embedder [15]_CITE, with linear attractive forces and the addition of a repulsive node-circle force that pushes nodes away from circle borders"
"Using the eight data sets, we generated visualizations using each of the five techniques; all of the diagrams are available from [1]_CITE as well as in the supplementary material"
"For the techniques that assign primary spatial rights to the network, the graphs were laid out using Gephi ForceAtlas 2 layout algorithm [6]_CITE; the same graph layout was used for these three techniques"
"For the remaining techniques, a palette of colours was generated using a qualitative colour scale from colorbrewer2.org [ 20_CITE]."
"For each visualization technique, in order to generate 16 visualizations, the original eight visualizations were rotated (as with LineSets in [3]_CITE)"
"Previous work has provided a classification of tasks on grouped network data, according to the information required to solve them: group-only, group-node, group-link and group-network [38]_CITE"
"With this in mind, we appealed to [47]_CITE, which presents tasks that people need to perform when analyzing social networks"
"T2 What are the interests of the person who, if removed, leaves n people disconnected from all the other people? This task identifies the interests of key players in the social network [11]_CITE."
T3 How many direct connections are there between people interested in X and people interested in Y? This measures the social cohesion between two groups [34]_CITE.
All of the questions used in the study are available online: the actual study can be taken at [1]_CITE.
"We adopted a crowdsourcing approach, using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) [32]_CITE to automatically out-source tasks"
"There is evidence that crowdsourcing is a valid approach for collecting data because this method has now gained recognition within the scientific community [21,32]_CITE"
All participants were paid $1 for taking part; $1 for 20 min work is higher than is typical for MTurk workers [32]_CITE
"Consistent with Meulemans et al [28]_CITE, we only analyze the correct answers"
"In the case of [25]_CITE, the set visualization was simpler to the one we used as there were no group overlaps"
"With regard to the previous study of Meulemans et al [28]_CITE, their key findings when comparing KelpFusion with LineSets and Bubble Sets were as follows: 1"
"For instance, our method SetNet exploits the iCircles technique that is theoretically proven to be able to visualize any finite collection of sets [42]_CITE"
"Indeed, it is increasing levels of clutter in Euler diagrams that has been shown to have a negative impact on task performance [4]_CITE"
"It would also be interesting to perform further empirical studies to explore the use of multiple unjoined circles, as with SetNet, as compared to the use of multiple joined convex shapes as in [35]_CITE."
"As a complex, dynamic system, financial markets can exhibit tipping points at which abrupt transitions to a contrasting dynamic regime may occur ( Scheffer_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"This shift is called a critical transition in financial markets, and it is exemplified by systemic market crashes or global crises ( Ang_&_Timmermann,_2012_CITE)"
"It is difficult to predict reliably when critical thresholds approach because markets might show little change before reaching the critical point ( Scheffer_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"In addition, shifts in financial markets are usually triggered by stochastic and unpredictable externalities ( Sugihara_et_al.,_2012;_Battiston_et_al.,_2016_CITE)"
"The intrinsic complexity and nonlinearity of financial markets make it hard to construct an integral mathematical model to characterize the financial system, and thus the corresponding early warning model is unable to be constructed ( Christofides,_Eicher,_&_Papageorgiou,_2016;_Kou_et_al.,_2014_CITE)"
"However, financial time series are comprehensive reflections of market operations and provide a database for market analysis ( Aus n,_Galeano,_&_Ghosh,_2014_CITE)"
"Through Phase Space Reconstruction (PSR), time series data can be reconstructed in a space in which the topology is equivalent to the original dynamic system ( Richard,_Michael,_Andrew,_&_Ye,_2004_CITE)"
"PSR describes the trajectory of the dynamic system in the reconstructed high-dimensional space ( He,_Liu,_Long,_&_Wang,_2012_CITE)"
"Takens embedding theorem shows that the N-dimensional dynamic system has a low-dimensional structure because the system state is confined to an attractor ( M) of dimension d( d < N) in the state space ( Han_&_Christopher,_2011_CITE)."

"Reviews covering SCADA security and cyber security issues are presented in Cheminod_et al._(2013),_Igure_et al._(2006),_Morgan_(2013),_Nicholson_et al._(2012)_CITE, but these reviews do not concentrate on risk assessment methods"
Risk assessment methods in general and in the context of SCADA systems specifically are hard to categorise as we conclude based on our analysis and in agreement with Morgan_(2013_CITE) and Ralston_et al._(2007_CITE)
"Messages are exchanged (1) between master devices, which control operation of other devices (eg PLCs) and slave devices (eg sensors, actuators, relays), which send messages to master devices and perform actions at their command, and (2) between field devices using a peer-to-peer communication model ( Igure_et al.,_2006_CITE)"

"The papers which are dedicated to security requirements derivation, but are not written in the context of risk assessment (eg Gopal_et al.,_2014_CITE) as well as the papers addressing vulnerability analysis from the technical rather than the risk management perspective (eg Jung_et al.,_2008;_Ten_et al.,_2008_CITE), were not included in our review"
"We focused only on research publications dealing primarily with cyber security or information security, while the papers covering risk assessment from the safety or reliability perspectives only (eg Hamoud_et al.,_2003_CITE) were excluded out of the review"
A risk assessment framework which utilises the Hierarchical Holographic Modelling (HHM) and is designed for GPS-based railway SCADA systems is described in Chittester_and_Haimes_(2004)_CITE.

The purpose of the assessment in Byres_et al._(2004)_CITE is to calculate the characteristics of the topmost attack event and to identify possible ways to achieve the final goal of the attack
The trees in Byres_et al._(2004)_CITE were designed by the team of industry experts and the feasibility of the attacks was tested in a laboratory settings.
"A cyber vulnerability assessment methodology for SCADA systems in Permann_and_Rohde_(2005_CITE) is based upon the experience of assessing the security of multiple SCADA systems conducted as a part of the national SCADA Test Bed program sponsored by the Department of Energy Office of Electricity and Energy Assurance, US and the Idaho National Laboratory SCADA Test Bed program."

The method is demonstrated on a non-automated hazardous liquid loading process which is described in Balasubramanian_et al._(2002)_CITE.
"Two risk metrics are proposed in Henry_et al._(2009)_CITE: (1) centre of mass risk measure, which is the median of the set of the consequence of all inducible SCADA and process failure modes; and (2) worst-case risk measure, which is a maximum value of the set"

"The following formula is introduced in Markovic-Petrovic_and_Stojanovic_(2014)_CITE for calculating Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE): (6)ALE=WA i=1NWi ( j=1MDLj) AROwhere WA is weighting factor, which scales maximum direct losses depending on the strength of attack; N is the number of conditions contributing to indirect losses; W is indirect costs resulting from a condition; M is the number of loss types; and ARO is the annual rate of the occurrence of an attack, which is defined based on the analysis of historical data."
The application of game theory to a cyber security analysis of a smart grid SCADA system is discussed in Hewett_et al._(2014)_CITE
"The following formula for calculating an impact of an action a is presented in Hewett_et al._(2014)_CITE: (8)Impact(a)=wcC(a)+wiI(a)+waA(a)where wc, wi, and wa are the weights of confidentiality, integrity and availability respectively and C(a), I(a) and A( a) are the impacts of action a on confidentiality, integrity and availability respectively"

"In Cheminod_et al._(2013),_Patel_et al._(2008),_Ralston_et al._(2007),_Taylor_et al._(2002)_CITE, among probabilistic tree-based methods for SCADA systems inductive and deductive methods are distinguished"
"Inductive methods (eg event tree) trace from possible causes to undesired events as opposed to deductive methods (eg fault and attack trees), which trace from undesired events to possible causes ( Ralston_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
"Inductive methods are also referred to as forward search techniques, while deductive methods are referred to as backward search techniques ( Taylor_et al.,_2002_CITE)."
"As pointed out in Morgan_(2013)_CITE and Ralston_et al._(2007)_CITE, risk assessment methods as applied to SCADA systems are difficult to categorise"
"Three of the papers examined, namely Beggs_and_Warren_(2009_CITE); Permann_and_Rohde_(2005_CITE); Song_et al._(2012_CITE), we were not able to assign to either formula- or model-based category since the papers are guidelines, and the specific methods of analysis within these guidelines must be chosen by users."
"As Table 3 also shows that among the model-based methods, the vast majority are attack- or failure-oriented, while only three methods ( Baiardi_et al.,_2009;_Chittester_and_Haimes,_2004;_Guan_et al.,_2011_CITE) are goal-oriented"
"More precisely Baiardi_et al._(2009_CITE) exploits dual approach, while infrastructure hypergraph may be attributed to the goal-oriented approach, evolution graph belongs to the attack-oriented approach"
"The goal-oriented approach focuses on positive outcomes and bring together the elements that an organisation's success ( The_Open_Group,_2012_CITE) as opposed to failure-oriented approach that concentrates around the identification of all possible types of attack and failure modes."
"Attack and vulnerability trees, which belong to PRA methods, usually concentrate on a specific type of attack and at best attempt to cover all known threats and vulnerabilities in an infrastructure ( Patel_et al.,_2008_CITE, p_484), ignoring unknown threats"
"In Kriaa_et al._(2012)_CITE, it is declared that in very large and complex situations the exhaustive computation of all possible attacks is often impossible or simply not practical."
"In Lewis_et al._(1979)_CITE, it is recommended to avoid use of the probabilistic risk analysis methodology for the determination of absolute risk probabilities for subsystems unless an adequate data base exists and it is possible to quantify the uncertainties."
"For example, a few of the assumptions encountered by this analysis are adversaries are like managers of multinational corporations who make rational choices investments and expected returns ( McQueen_et al.,_2006_CITE), the vulnerabilities of each component C are known ( Ten_et al.,_2010_CITE), perfect information of an attacker and a system administrator when both players know what has happened to the system so far before making their decision on the next move ( Hewett_et al.,_2014_CITE) and the defender will not take any action to defend the system unless an attack action occurs ( Hewett_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"The examples of other assumptions are the independence of security events, the stationarity of a system over time or similarities with other systems, the use of the aggregation of security numbers related to the different components of a system overlooking mutual interdependencies ( Verendel,_2009_CITE)"
"Methods do not effectively cope with risks with low probabilities, but extreme, catastrophic consequences ( Morgan,_2013_CITE)"
"For predicting catastrophic events such as for example 9/11, Fukushima and Chernobyl frequency-based statistical methods on which PRA methods rely have little value ( Haimes_and_Chittester,_2005;_Ramana,_2011_CITE)."
"Table 5 shows that in the methods examined probabilities used for the calculation of risk or impact are derived based on historical data (eg incident logs as in Gertman_et al.,_2006_CITE), expert judgement or both"
"Objective data in this instance are data received from statistical sampling, historical records or experimentation ( Taylor_et al.,_2002_CITE)."
"The authors of the methods examined point out that data required for the effective estimation of risk are rarely available ( Dondossola_et al.,_2009;_McQueen_et al.,_2006_CITE) and, therefore, research often has to rely on artificial data ( Luiijf_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"In Henry_et al._(2009)_CITE, the authors consciously avoid the use of probabilistic data, but characterise security by median loss and maximum loss"
"While one method ( Song_et al.,_2012_CITE) aims to list and discuss risk assessment activities to be undertaken at the system design stage, four methods ( Guan_et al.,_2011;_Permann_and_Rohde,_2005;_Ten_et al.,_2010;_Yu_et al.,_2006_CITE) target to identify vulnerabilities and/or to quantify the level of vulnerability of a system"
The method presented in Chittester_and_Haimes_(2004)_CITE strives to identify sources of risk
"The declared aim of three methods ( Baiardi_et al.,_2009;_Patel_et al.,_2008;_Roy_et al.,_2010_CITE) is the assistance with the selection of an optimal set of countermeasures."
"The application of a method to a real world system is declared as future work in several proposals (eg LeMay_et al.,_2010_CITE)"
"In Byres_et al._(2004)_CITE, the validity of an attack tree is evaluated by energy sector operators and the feasibility of attacks is tested in a laboratory setting"
"In Beggs_and_Warren_(2009)_CITE, the guideline aiming at protection of SCADA systems from the threat of cyber-terrorism within Australia is evaluated by a focus group of five SCADA system consultants."
"The process of risk management, as it is adopted in ISO 31000:2009(E) ( ISO,_2009_CITE) and ISO/IEC 27005:2011 ( ISO,_2011_CITE), is depicted in Fig_5 ."
"ISO 31000:2009(E) ( ISO,_2009_CITE) provides the following definitions for risk management and risk assessment: Risk management coordinated activities to direct and control an organisation with regard to risk (ISO, 2009, Def"
"Risk management coordinated activities to direct and control an organisation with regard to risk ( ISO,_2009_CITE, Def"
"Risk assessment overall process of risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation ( ISO,_2009_CITE, Def"
"2.2), where risk identification is the process of finding, recognizing and describing risks ( ISO,_2009_CITE, Def"
"2.15), risk analysis is the process to comprehend the nature of risk and to determine the level of risk ( ISO,_2009_CITE, Def"
"2.21) and risk evaluation is the process of comparing the results of risk analysis with risk criteria to determine whether the risk and/or its magnitude is acceptable or tolerable ( ISO,_2009_CITE, Def"
"The stages and their definitions are adopted as outlined in ISO 31000:2009(E) ( ISO,_2009_CITE) and ISO/IEC 27005:2011 ( ISO,_2011_CITE)."
"There are though several proposals ( Henry_and_Haimes,_2009;_LeMay_et al.,_2011;_McQueen_et al.,_2006;_Patel_et al.,_2008_CITE), which we mark with regarding risk evaluation in Table 7, where the comparison of risk metrics is performed between different security configurations of a system."
"During the context establishment stage an organisation examines its structure, current security posture, specifies security goals and security strategy, investigates possible external influences ( ISO,_2009_CITE)"
"The following key concepts of risk management are widely acknowledged in the literature: system (asset), vulnerability, threat, impact (consequence) and security control (countermeasure) ( Cheminod_et al.,_2013;_Ericsson,_2009;_Francia_et al.,_2012;_Markovic-Petrovic_and_Stojanovic,_2014;_Verendel,_2009_CITE)"
"One of the major requirements to a risk assessment method is to produce simple key security indicators which would enable senior management and security experts to take well-informed security decisions without getting lost in technical detail ( Leversage_and_Byres,_2008_CITE)"
"In Gertman_et al._(2006)_CITE, the impact is measured in monetary terms plus a number of human lives"
"In Hewett_et al._(2014)_CITE and Ten_et al._(2010)_CITE, numeric indices are proposed"
"Out of twenty-four papers examined a software prototype or tool supporting the method is discussed only in seven papers, namely Baiardi_et al._(2009_CITE); Cardenas_et al._(2011_CITE); Kriaa_et al._(2012_CITE); LeMay_et al._(2011_CITE); Patel_and_Zaveri_(2010_CITE); Roy_et al._(2010_CITE); Ten_et al._(2010_CITE)"
"In Roy_et al._(2010)_CITE, the authors use the existing tools SHARPE and MATLAB"
"In LeMay_et al._(2011)_CITE, the prototype is based on the existing modelling tool M bius"
"In Cardenas_et al._(2011)_CITE, the tool builds upon MATLAB and uses FORTRAN"
"In Kriaa_et al._(2012)_CITE, another existing tool, KB3, automates risk assessment method proposed."
"Thus, [u]nderstanding consequences and estimating likelihood from cause-related logic trees seem to be pre-requisites of any approach to analyzing risks in a system ( The_Open_Group,_2012_CITE, p_5)."
"We see the application of a goal-oriented approach to risk management ( The_Open_Group,_2012_CITE), which would support risk management even in situations where a comprehensive list of failure modes or attack types may not be established, as one of the research challenges of the field"
"We believe that the use a goal-oriented dependency modelling approach ( The_Open_Group,_2012_CITE) in the context of SCADA systems offers multiple benefits including the overcoming failure-orientation"
"It is not restricted to the boundaries of an organisation and it does not rely on historical data or on the completeness of the list of potential threats ( The_Open_Group,_2012_CITE)"
"In 2007, one of the studies on SCADA systems cyber security reported that accurate historical data on cyber impacts was badly lacking in the SCADA or process industries thus making accurate risk assessment extremely difficult ( Byres_et al.,_2007_CITE)."
"SCADA testbeds may fill up the lack of historical data by building up vulnerability and attack databases ( Dondossola_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Controlled simulations on test platforms may help to collect statistics regarding vulnerability existence and severity, and attack success rates ( Dondossola_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"There is a range of SCADA testbeds developed by universities across the world ( Dondossola_et al.,_2009;_Morris_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"A number of CNI, ICS and SCADA systems security databases exist, eg the RISI database ( Tudor_and_Fabro,_2010_CITE), which is mentioned earlier in this section, and the Industrial Security Incident Database (ISID) ( Byres_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
Vulnerability databases accounting for SCADA systems are listed in Song_et al._(2012)_CITE
"Although information sharing initiatives exist (eg in order to facilitate information exchange, the European SCADA and Control Systems Information Exchange (EUROSCSIE) was established under the initiative of the CPNI_CITE) they do not typically involve researchers to the desirable degree"
"In 2007, in Ralston_et al._(2007)_CITE it was mentioned that a natural extension to PRA involves the use of fuzzy concepts, though this approach has not been published for use in SCADA system security risk assessment"
"In Yan_et al._(2013)_CITE, the Duality Element Relative Fuzzy Evaluation Method (DERFEM) is exploited for quantifying the severity of vulnerabilities"
"According to Verendel_(2009_CITE), methods for quantifying security are in general weakly justified"
"The general guidance on choosing an evaluation method (or a combination of them) could be found in Venable_et al._(2012)_CITE, where methods are categorised into naturalistic (evaluation in real settings) and artificial (evaluation in laboratory settings, analytical evaluation, simulations etc.) as well as ex ante (evaluation of an uninstantiated artefact) and ex post (evaluation of an instantiated artefact)"
"A good risk analysis method shall be (1) comprehensive, (2) adherent to evidence, (3) logically sound, (4) practical and politically acceptable, (5) open to evaluation, (6) based on explicit assumptions and premises, (7) compatible with the institutions, (8) conducive to learning, (9) attuned to risk communication, and (10) innovative ( Haimes_and_Chittester,_2005_CITE)"
"A risk assessment method may also be evaluated regarding its fitness for purpose, ease to learn and use, the ability of the method to generate correct result, the effectiveness in achieving its goal, efficacy, ethicality, elegance and in terms of acceptance by practitioners ( Moody,_2003;_Venable_et al.,_2012_CITE)."
"The MEM builds upon and adapts the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) ( Davis,_1989_CITE) for the evaluation of system design methods and modelling languages"
"The TAM is well accepted in the IS literature as a theoretical model for the evaluation of technology acceptance ( Moody,_2003_CITE)"
"Unfortunately, without taking precautions we may not hope for this to happen in future as attackers get more sophisticated, experienced and malicious ( Haimes_and_Chittester,_2005_CITE)."
"First, considering the number of attacks, it is worth remembering that only a small number of security incidents is reported Discussions with operators of traditional business crime reporting databases indicate that a typical incident database collects no better than one in ten of the actual events occurring ( Byres_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
"For example, for incidents in power industry it was noted that While these may not be frequent in an absolute sense, there are good reasons to believe that they will be far more frequent than quantitative tools such as probabilistic risk assessments predict ( Ramana,_2011_CITE)"
"In line with the above, it is stated in The_Open_Group_(2012)_CITE that [c]omplex systems always retain the capacity to produce novel or surprising events."
"However, most problems arising in OR are proved to be NP-hard, ie, polynomial-time intractable unless P = NP [1]_CITE"
Evolutionary computation is a class of optimization methods drawing inspiration from natural evolution and adaptation [2]_CITE
"Particularly, intrinsic probabilistic behaviors render them capable of effectively handling real world problems involving nonlinearity, complexity, noisy environment, imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness [3,4]_CITE"
"Although this problem can be solved by specialized methods that are more efficient than standard linear programs [10]_CITE, EAs can provide much better performance on very large problem instances [11]_CITE"
"Moreover, real-world problems typically have to deal with heterogenous commodities and transportation modes, involving additional (and often nonlinear) objectives and constraints [12]_CITE"
"Furthermore, transportation in emergency logistics [13]_CITE is often subject to uncertainty and randomization, has very limited time constraints, focuses more concern on timeliness and/or risk rather than transportation cost"
"Thus the formulation of real-world emergency facility location problems, especially in large-scale operations, should take into consideration redundant facilities, service priorities, as well as location dynamics [15]_CITE, to ensure an acceptable demand coverage."
Vehicle routing problems (VRP) are a class of fundamental NP-hard problems which have been widely studied in the literature [18]_CITE
"Ordinary shop job scheduling models and solution methods [19]_CITE generally do not apply, because they fail to capture time dependencies among repair operations, eg, many damaged points are unreachable unless some other damaged points have been repaired"
"By incorporating time variables, Yan and Shih [20]_CITE developed a time-space network that models the roadway repair problem as an integer network flow problem with side constraints"
"For such multiobjective optimization (MOO) problems, it is preferable to simultaneously optimize all the objectives by evolving a set of solutions to the so-called Pareto front to provide a comprehensive decision support [22,23]_CITE"
"Multiobjective EAs (MOEAs) are favorable for this purpose, because they concurrently evolve a population of possible solutions and thus enable to find several members of the Pareto optimal set in a single run of the algorithm, instead of having to perform a series of separate runs as in the case of traditional optimization methods [24]_CITE."
"M-Pop The method uses multiple populations to cooperatively solve the problems, which extends the basic single-population based EAs to co-evolutionary methods [25]_CITE."
An early work of Tuson et al [26]_CITE developed a prototype system of emergency resource distribution planning on a 386-class PC

"Considering a much more complex model with multi-items, multi-vehicles, multi-periods, soft time windows, and a split delivery strategy, Lin et al [40]_CITE formulated a multi-objective integer programming model and developed two heuristic approaches: The first is based on GA, while the second approach further decomposes the original problem"

The dynamics of water waves is Hamiltonian and the governing equations can be also obtained from Luke variational principle [1]_CITE or from its dynamical equivalent presented by Miles [2]_CITE.
"This is necessary for most practical problems involving waves generated by a driven wavemaker or the removal of a sluice gate; for example, see Bokhove and Kalogirou [8]_CITE for a problem concerning water waves generated by removing a sluice gate in a wave tank"
"Likewise, dissipative wave problems were studied by Thornton et al [9]_CITE and Bokhove et al [10]_CITE, who investigated the dynamics of gravity water waves in a vertical Hele-Shaw cell with a moving interface between water and air"
The Hele-Shaw cell [11]_CITE is a narrow wave tank consisting of two closely spaced glass plates
"Thornton et al [9]_CITE presented results regarding damped wave sloshing, while Bokhove et al [10]_CITE also included a wave pump and studied the damped motion of driven water waves."
"Such flows have become of interest in connection with applications in coastal engineering [12]_CITE, biomedical engineering [13]_CITE and the oil industry [14]_CITE"
"Several researchers have investigated the stability of the interface between two viscous fluids in a horizontal Hele-Shaw cell (eg Saffman and Taylor [15]_CITE, Park and Homsy [16]_CITE, Park et al [17]_CITE), but others also studied free surface waves (eg Rajchenbach et al [18]_CITE) or the Kelvin Helmholtz instability (eg Plourabou and Hinch [19]_CITE) in vertical Hele-Shaw cells"
"Classical Hele-Shaw flows are based on the assumption of low Reynolds number (Taylor and Saffman [20]_CITE) and the dominant flow velocity profile between the plates is parabolic, ie of Poiseuille-type [21,22]_CITE"
"The use of linear damping is validated in Thornton et al [9]_CITE, where the authors compared numerical solutions to damped wave sloshing experiments"
The dynamics thus become non-autonomous due to the explicit time-dependence and therefore this work is based on the theory developed in Bokhove and Kalogirou [8]_CITE for non-autonomous variational principles in time
The continuum model is discretised in space and time using a (dis)continuous Galerkin finite element method and the numerical model is then implemented using the automated system Firedrake [23]_CITE
"A variational principle for the Lagrangian density L describing the dynamics of shallow water waves with surface tension can be obtained by extending the well-known Luke variational principle [1]_CITE and is given by: (1)0= 0T 0L( th 12h( x )2 12g(h h0)2 (1+( xh)2 1))dx+ELh(L,t) E0h(0,t)dt,with water depth h=h(x,t) and velocity potential = (x,t) as functions of the spatial coordinate x and time t"
"(4) are the standard shallow water equations but with added surface tension [24,25]_CITE."
"The former is a simple model of a wave pump and the latter models the bulk friction in a Hele-Shaw cell, following the derivation in Thornton et al [9]_CITE and Bokhove et al [10]_CITE"
The resulting discretisation is implemented in the finite element package Firedrake [23]_CITE
"As in Bokhove and Kalogirou [8]_CITE, the time stepping scheme is put in the standard Kamiltonian form for variational principles with explicit time dependence by a coordinate transformation Ph= he t and Qh=hh"
"A St rmer Verlet time discretisation (Hairer et al [26]_CITE) for this Kamiltonian formulation then consists of a half step to update h in time, (11a)0= 0L(( hn+1/2e tn+1/2 hne tn) t/2+12( x hn+1/2)2e tn+1/2+(hhn h0)e tn+1/2) hh+ xhhne tn+1/2 x( hh)dx+E(tn+1/2)e tn+1/2 hh(0),a full step to update hh, (11b)0= 0Lhhn+1 hhn t Ph 12(hhn+hhn+1) x hn+1/2 x( Ph)dx Q(tn+1/2) Ph(0),and a final half step for h, (11c)0= 0L(( hn+1e tn+1 hn+1/2e tn+1/2) t/2+12( x hn+1/2)2e tn+1/2+(hhn+1 h0)e tn+1/2) hh+ xhhn+1e tn+1/2 x( hh)dx+E(tn+1/2)e tn+1/2 hh(0)."
"To validate our variational finite element model, we will compare simulations thereof against laboratory measurements of a new Hele-Shaw cell for wave beach interactions, see Fig_1 (the new tank is an alteration of the Hele-Shaw tank in [9,10]_CITE)"
A similar comparison has been presented by Sun and Hsu [27]_CITE who also carried out experiments in a vertical Hele-Shaw device and computed the wave number and rate of decay along propagation distance of free surface waves
A further extension of this subject is the study of beach formation by breaking waves in a Hele-Shaw cell [12]_CITE
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a metaheuristic method for global optimization which is inspired by the behavior of a swarm of birds or fish [7]_CITE
"In order to improve the diversity of the search in the PSO, various kinds of models have been investigated [4,19]_CITE"
"It has been reported that these PSO variants have a more diverse search than does the standard PSO [1,3,10,17]_CITE."
"In this paper, we focus on the chaotic PSO exploiting a virtual quartic objective function based on the personal and global best solutions(CPSO-VQO) [17]_CITE"
"Moreover, in [17]_CITE, Tatsumi et al presented a sufficient condition for chaoticity of the system used in CPSO-VQO and showed that the parameter values in the system can be selected by utilizing its bifurcation diagram"
"Recently, various PSOs that make use of chaotic systems have been investigated [1,3,8,10]_CITE"
"On the other hand, metaheuristic methods exploiting a chaotic system based on the steepest descent method have been investigated [15,18,20]_CITE; these methods normally search for a solution along the steepest descent direction of the objective function, but they can also execute an extensive search by exploiting the chaotic nature of generated sequences"
"Most models derive a chaotic system by transforming the original constraint problem into an unconstrained one with a diffeomorphic function, such as a sigmoid function, and then applying the steepest descent method with a large step-size to the unconstrained problem, for which it is well known that the derived system is chaotic if the step-size is sufficiently large [6]_CITE"
"Besides, there is another method of generating a chaotic sequence, the gradient model with sinusoidal perturbations (GP) [16]_CITE"
The GP method works better than do methods with the transformation and a larger step-size [16]_CITE
"Recently, a combination of the PSO and GP methods, CPSO-VQO, was proposed [17]_CITE"
"The chaoticity of system (C1) is guaranteed by the property that a system derived by using the steepest descent method with a perturbation can be chaotic [16]_CITE, and it is summarized as follows"
"Then, it is well-known that there are an infinite number of orbits which are repelled by the snap-back repeller but which are attracted to its neighborhood [12]_CITE"
"As a countermeasure, a large inertia weight wd of (C1) was selected in [17]_CITE; this can reduce the amount of change of the critical value that is caused by the variation in r"
"Nevertheless, since wd is selected to be nonzero in CPSO-VQO from the reason mentioned above, almost all particles are able to search for solutions without becoming trapped, and such a behavior was not observed in the numerical experiments [17]_CITE"
"Then, we have the following theorem with respect to chaos in the sense of Li Yorke [9]_CITE: Theorem 2 (Marotto Li Chen Theorem) : Suppose that F ( x) is continuously differential on a set X 0 R n and z is a fixed point of F, and that 1"
"Theorem 2 is an improved version of the original theorem by Marotto [11]_CITE, which was proved by Li and Chen [9]_CITE"
"Since in [17]_CITE it was reported that the diversity of the search was more significant during the early stages in the numerical experiments for CPSO-VQO, in this model, the initial value of ( t) is set to be large and is decreased exponentially, as follows: (62) (t)= sexp( cdtTmax)+ f,where T max denotes the maximum number of iterations, and f are the initial and final values of ( t), respectively, and cd is constant that are used to adjust the decreasing rate of ( t)"
"In this subsection, we show the results of numerical experiments in which the standard PSO (PSO), the four existing improved PSOs, PSO-IWA, CEPSOA [1]_CITE, CPSO-VQO [17]_CITE and HPSO-TVAC [13]_CITE, and the five proposed PSOs, PSO-TPC, PSO-SPC, PSO-SDPC, IPSO-SPC and IPSO-SDPC, were applied to the following 50, 200, and 400-dimensional benchmark problems: Rastrigin, Rosenbrock, Griewank, Levy No"
"Technical debt (TD) is a metaphor used to describe a situation in software development, where a shortcut or workaround is used in a technical decision ( Kruchten et al,_2012b_CITE)"
"TD has also similarities to three aspects of financial debt: repayment, interest, and in some cases high cost ( Allman, 2012_CITE)"
"In software development, a shortcut or workaround can give the company a benefit in the short term with quicker release to the customer and an advantage in time-to-market over the competition ( Kruchten_et al.,_2012a;_Yli-Huumo_et al.,_2015a_CITE)"
"However, if these shortcuts and workarounds are not repaid, TD can accumulate and hurt the overall quality of the software and the productivity of the development team in the long term ( Zazworka et al,_2011b_CITE)"
"Creating temporary solutions to the code base increases complexity, which makes further development hard and time-consuming ( Yli-Huumo_et al.,_2015a;_Yli-Huumo_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"TD and TDM receive attention currently both in the academia and the industry ( Li et al,_2015a_CITE)"
"Researchers and practitioners are becoming more interested in the concept of TD and the reasons why it should be an essential part of decision-making in software development ( Falessi et al,_2014_CITE)"
"However, according to a recent mapping study, the problem is the lack of empirical evidence about TDM in a real-life software development environment ( Li et al,_2015a_CITE)"
"We used the exploratory case study method ( Robson, 2002_CITE) to answer the following main research question:"
"Technical debt management can be separated into the following activities: identification, measurement, prioritization, prevention, monitoring, repayment, representation/documentation, and communication ( Li et al,_2015a_CITE)"
"There are a number of possible methods, models, practices or tools for every TDM activity ( Li et al,_2015a_CITE)"
"Some software development teams may use more time on TDM, while some development teams may not pay much attention to it ( Power, 2013_CITE)"
"Therefore, it is important to understand if it is possible to distinguish between different maturities of TDM, similarly as in the capability maturity model (CMM)( Paulk et al,_1993_CITE)"
"Even though the metaphor was first introduced over twenty years ago, a recent mapping study shows that it has received the attention of researchers and practitioners only in the past few years ( Li et al,_2015a_CITE)."
"The TD metaphor was first associated with compromises on the code level of software ( Cunningham, 1992_CITE)"
"In addition, terms like code smells ( Fowler et al,_1999_CITE) have described situations where poor technical choices in software development have caused problems in code quality and architectural soundness"
"However, the TD metaphor has been rapidly expanded after the initial concept on the code level, and it has been associated with other stages of the software development lifecycle as well ( Tom_et al.,_2013;_Alves_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"The current literature identifies such terms as requirements ( Brown et al,_2010_CITE), design ( Zazworka_et al.,_2011b;_Zazworka_et al.,_2011a_CITE), architectural ( Nord et al,_2012_CITE), test ( Brown et al,_2010_CITE), process ( Lim et al,_2012_CITE), documentation ( Kruchten et al,_2012a_CITE), and people debt ( Kruchten et al,_2012b_CITE) to demonstrate the same effect of shortcuts or workarounds happening in the other stages of the software development lifecycle."
"Shortcuts and workarounds in software development usually happen for intentional reasons, such as for business deadlines and development complexity ( Yli-Huumo et al,_2015a_CITE)"
"Time-to-market and customer feedback are important factors for companies success, and it is essential to deliver solutions on time ( Lim et al,_2012_CITE)"
"This is the reason why business stakeholders are often more focused on deadlines and customers than the actual quality of the software, which is more in the developers interest area ( Barney_et al.,_2008;_Boehm,_2006_CITE)"
"Therefore, strict deadlines may sometimes force the development team to create solutions with second-tier quality to meet the requirements within the deadlines set by the business stakeholders ( Yli-Huumo et al,_2014_CITE)"
"When TD starts to accumulate, it is often a safer and faster choice to take more TD with a quick and dirty solution, because there is a risk of breaking the product even more by modifying a complex part of the code base ( Yli-Huumo et al,_2015a_CITE)"
"Thus, code base complexity can force the company to take more TD intentionally, because the fixing of current TD would take too much time and money, while quick and dirty solutions are easier and faster to implement ( Yli-Huumo et al,_2014_CITE)."
"TD can also occur unintentionally ( McConnell, 2007_CITE)"
"Fig_1 shows a TD quadrant ( Fowler, 2009_CITE) that identifies four categories of having TD for intentional and unintentional reasons ( McConnell, 2007_CITE)."
"TD is often seen only as a negative concept in software development ( Lim_et al.,_2012;Yli-Huumo_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"Software developers think that creating shortcuts and non-scalable solutions will increase the complexity within the code base ( Yli-Huumo et al,_2014_CITE)"
"Complexities in the code base start to reduce the overall quality and productivity goes down when new solutions and features must be implemented to the code base in debt ( Yli-Huumo et al,_2015a_CITE)."
"Another benefit for companies is customer feedback ( Yli-Huumo et al,_2015b_CITE)"
"According to some scholars, TD should be associated only with intentional decisions happening in the code base, and messy code should not be counted as TD, while some think that old technologies in legacy software should also be counted as TD ( Norton,_2009;_Fowler,_2009_CITE)"
"The current literature related to TDM has identified and developed some processes and tools ( Li et al,_2015a_CITE)"
"Managing technical debt (MTD) workshops have gathered multiple studies related to TD and TDM in the past years ( Seaman et al,_2015_CITE)"
"However, TDM is challenging to implement, and it is hard for managers and developers to estimate and identify what and how much TD the current system has, how it will change, and what effects it will have in the future ( Li et al,_2015a_CITE)"
Power (2013)_CITE identifies seven main challenges surrounding TDM: (1) agreeing what technical debt is; (2) quantifying technical debt; (3) visualizing technical debt; (4) tracking technical debt over time; (5) impact of neglecting technical debt over multiple releases; (6) identifying technical debt as a root cause of defects; and (7) understanding the cost of delay.
"The reduction and repayment of TD are done by refactoring or rewriting the bad solutions ( Codabux and_Williams, 2013_CITE)"
"In essence when you refactor you are improving the design of the code after it has been written ( Fowler et al,_1999_CITE, p_9)"
A portfolio approach for TDM has been suggested by Guo and_Seaman (2011)_CITE
Li et al (2015b)_CITE have also developed similar TD list management for architectural technical debt (ATD).
"Implementing coding standards to the development process can prevent TD, when the developers have a cohesive way to produce a similar style code, which makes it readable and modifiable ( Green and_Ledgard, 2011_CITE)"
"Code reviews can be used to check other developers' solutions before the release to catch possible TD issues in the design ( Mantyla and_Lassenius, 2009_CITE)"
"Also simple practices in agile methodologies, such as the Definition of Done practice can reduce TD in the early stages of development ( Davis, 2013_CITE)."
An extensive mapping study of 49 primary studies has been recently conducted by Li et al (2015a)_CITE to understand the current state of the art on TDM
Guo et al (2011)_CITE use a specific TDM framework to track down one delayed maintenance task in a real software project
"A similar approach has also been used by other researchers to identify and document TD issues in order to make TD easier to manage ( Zazworka et al,_2013_CITE)."
Klinger et al (2011)_CITE interviewed four experienced software architects to understand how decision-making regarding TD was conducted in an enterprise environment
"The SQALE method ( Letouzey,_2012_CITE; Letouzey_and_Ilkiewicz,_2012_CITE) has been developed for the purposes of identifying, estimating, analyzing, measuring, and monitoring TD in a software"
"DebtFlag ( Holvitie and_Lepp nen, 2013_CITE) has been developed to capture, track and resolve TD in software projects"
"The SonarQube tool and its plugins have been applied in several studies to identify and measure TD from software ( Al_Mamun_et al.,_2014;_Griffith_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
A set of other tools to support TD management were identified in the mapping study by Li et al (2015a)_CITE.
"Most of the empirical studies of TDM take in consideration only few aspects of the eight TDM activities ( Li et al,_2015a_CITE)"
"The definition by Yin describes a case study as an empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context, especially when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident ( Yin, 2003_CITE, p_13)"
"However, the case study methodology has also been used in economics (ibid.), and it has become more popular in software engineering as well ( Runeson and_H st, 2008_CITE)."
"Software development is carried out by individuals, groups and organizations, and therefore social and political questions are of importance for software development, which makes software engineering a multidisciplinary area where case study is a relevant approach ( Runeson and_H st, 2008_CITE)"
"This study can be defined as an interpretive exploratory case study ( Robson, 2002_CITE), as the goal of the study is to discover how software development teams have organized TDM, without a priori hypotheses"
"In addition, an interpretive case study aims at understanding phenomena through the participants interpretation of their context ( Runeson and_H st, 2008_CITE)."
"The design step of the case study process should contain the following elements: objective, the case, theory, research questions, methods, and selection strategy ( Runeson_and_H st,_2008;_Robson,_2002_CITE)"
"This approach is similar to the theoretical sampling used in the grounded theory method ( Strauss and_Corbin, 1998_CITE), where the next data sample is chosen on the basis of an analysis of a previous sample, creating an iterative process for theory construction"
"Semi-structured interviews include a mixture of open-ended and specific questions, designed to elicit not only the information foreseen, but also unexpected types of information ( Seaman, 1999_CITE)"
Yin (2003)_CITE separates case studies to holistic case studies and embedded case studies
"After that we used the snowballing technique ( Charmaz, 2014_CITE) to get referrals to other persons in the teams"
The analysis of causes and effects of TD is available as a separate publication by Yli-Huumo et al (2014)_CITE
The second reason for focusing more on TDM was the publication of the TDM mapping study by Li et al (2015a)_CITE
"In exploratory case studies, the technique for the analysis of qualitative data is hypothesis generation ( Seaman, 1999_CITE)"
"The techniques for data analysis used in exploratory case studies are constant comparisons and cross-case analysis ( Seaman, 1999_CITE) ."
"The codes can form a hierarchy of codes and sub-codes ( Robson, 2002_CITE)"
"This is not a surprise, considering the popularity of TD research in the past few years ( Li et al,_2015a_CITE)"
"The biggest issue with TD communication has been the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders ( Klinger et al,_2011_CITE)"
"Communication related to TD issues does not often transfer from the development team to the business stakeholders, which leads to TD issues not receiving the required time to get fixed ( Yli-Huumo et al,_2014_CITE)"
Similar practices identified in a study by Codabux and_Williams (2013)_CITE were reengineering and repackaging
"Some teams opt to reduce TD by a certain percentage every month, while some teams opt to focus on new features, and leave TD reduction to minimum ( Power, 2013_CITE)"
"A set of other practices for TD prevention have been identified in other studies ( Codabux_et al.,_2014;_Krishna_and_Basu,_2012_CITE)"
"These practices include approaches such as education and training, pair programming, test-driven development, refactoring, continuous integration, conformance to process and standards, tools, and customer feedback ( Codabux et al,_2014_CITE)"
"Code reviews, where another developer checks your code can be used to prevent bad solutions from getting to the code base ( Baker,_1997;_Kemerer_and_Paulk,_2009_CITE), while setting up coding standards/guidelines for the development team to ensure as much cohesion as possible during the development ( Green and_Ledgard, 2011_CITE) can improve understandability and learnability."
"When the development team has set up mandatory coding standards, assisted with eg code reviews and Definition of Done practice, it is possible that the amount of TD that gets to the code base will decrease ( Davis, 2013_CITE)"
"Developers may also value documentation differently, and they document only issues that they personally think are important ( Lethbridge et al,_2003_CITE)"
"Without proper tracking and documentation of architectural changes and issues, it is also extremely challenging to quantify TD ( Klinger et al,_2011_CITE)"
"Documentation is a valuable practice that improves understandability and communication ( Das_et al.,_2007;_Forward_and_Lethbridge,_2002_CITE)"
"A systematic process to document and store all the TD issues can be used for creating a systematic TD repayment strategy ( Lim et al,_2012_CITE)."
"The challenge is how the tools tackle architectural or structural issues and technology gaps ( Kruchten et al,_2012a_CITE)"
"This issue has also been raised in a previous TD study ( Zazworka et al,_2014_CITE), questioning how TD issues could be identified from the code base"
"An interesting question related to TD identification is whether developer-identified TD should be considered as real TD , while tool-identified TD should not, because it is not necessarily related to the effects of external (such as customer and market) changes in the software architecture ( Zazworka et al,_2013_CITE)."
"Ramasubbu et al (2015)_CITE describe TD prioritization with three dimensions: customer satisfaction needs, reliability demanded by the business, and probability of technology disruption"
"Prioritization can also be based on customer needs, but this can leave the most important TD from the technical perspective out of sight ( Codabux and_Williams, 2013_CITE)"
"These prioritization issues exist also in requirements prioritization ( Lehtola and_Kauppinen, 2006_CITE)."
"For example, SonarQube calculates TD from seven deadly sins ( SonarQube, 2015_CITE), each one representing a major quality item: bad distribution of the complexity, duplications, lack of comments, coding rule violations, potential bugs, no unit tests or useless ones, and bad design ( SonarQube, 2015_CITE)"
"However, TD measurement has the same problem as TD identification: what technical debt do you want to estimate? When a development team considers for example the criteria in SonarQube (2015)_CITE as TD, in can guide TD management and other TD activities"
"However, TD can also be considered to consist of issues of a larger scale, such as architectural or structural issues and technology gaps ( Kruchten et al,_2012a_CITE)"
"TD monitoring and tracking is one of the most vital TDM activities ( Ernst et al,_2015_CITE)"
"Ernst et al_(2015_CITE, p_?) state that developers desire standard practices and tools to manage technical debt that do not currently exist"
"As Ernst et al_(2015_CITE, p_?) comment, tooling is a necessary component of any technical debt management strategy , we also believe that an important research area currently in TDM is the research and development done for tools designed to tackle different TDM activities"
"The goal of TDM is to provide practices and tools to manage and reduce TD during software development ( Li et al,_2015a_CITE)"
"A case study does not provide statistical generalizability ( Yin, 2003_CITE), ie a case study with a limited number of cases cannot be generalized over a population"
"We, however, consider generalization as theoretical ( Lee and_Baskerville, 2003_CITE), ie abstraction from concrete events and actions to theoretical constructs"
"The threats to the validity of a case study can be divided to four aspects: construct validity, internal validity, external validity, and reliability ( Runeson and_H st, 2008_CITE)"
"The concern is being certain that when a causality between x and y is found, factor z is not included, which we did not identify during the interviews ( Runeson and_H st, 2008_CITE)"
"External validity is concerned with to what extent it is possible to generalize the findings, and to what extent the findings are of interest to other people outside the investigated case ( Runeson and_H st, 2008_CITE, p_154)"
"Reliability is concerned with to what extent the data and the analysis are dependent on the specific researchers ( Runeson and_H st, 2008_CITE, p_154)"
"On the basis of our findings we believe that TDM in software development has similarities to the characteristics of the capability maturity model (CMM) ( Paulk et al,_1993_CITE)"
"The five levels in CMM are initial (chaotic), repeatable, defined, quantitatively managed, and optimizing ( Paulk et al,_1993_CITE)"
"This kind of maturity as a concept has been applied to other processes and domains as well ( De Bruin_et al.,_2005_CITE)."
"The vision of Cloud Computing is to provide computing power as a utility, like gas, electricity or water [1]_CITE"
"This work can be integrated into the Foundations of Self-governing ICT Infrastructure (FoSII) project [2]_CITE, but is on its own completely self-sufficient"
"Besides the already implemented LoM2HiS framework [3]_CITE that takes care of monitoring the state of the Cloud infrastructure and its applications, the knowledge management (KM) system presented in this article can be viewed as another building block of the FoSII infrastructure"
"On the other hand, we gathered real world data from monitoring scientific workflow applications in the field of bioinformatics [9]_CITE"
"These workflows need a huge, yet unpredictable and varying amount of resources, and are thus due to the needed flexibility and scalability a perfect match for a Cloud computing application [10]_CITE."
"A quite similar approach to our concept is provided by the Sandpiper framework [15]_CITE, which offers black-box and gray-box resource management for VMs"
"Other works such as [25]_CITE have already considered the last escalation level (see Section 4), ie, outsourcing of applications to other Clouds"
"Fourthly, compared to other SLA management projects like SLA@SOI [32]_CITE, the FoSII project in general is more specific on Cloud Computing aspects like deployment, monitoring of resources and their translation into high level SLAs instead of just working on high-level SLAs in general service-oriented architectures."
A possible solution for this is the so called SLA mapping approach presented in [33]_CITE
The idea of bandwidth sharing is a common idea in network systems as described in [36]_CITE
"The problem stemming from escalation level 3 alone can be formulated into a binary integer problem (BIP), which is known to be NP-complete [37]_CITE"
"The proof is out of scope for this paper, but a similar approach can be seen in [12]_CITE"
"Escalation level 5: Finally, the last escalation level 5 tries to outsource the application to another Cloud provider as explained, eg, in the Reservoir project [38]_CITE"
Case Based Reasoning is the process of solving problems based on past experience [39]_CITE
"Following the principle of semantic similarity from [40]_CITE for the summation part this leads to the following equation (3)d(c ,c+)=min(wid,|id id+|)+ x Pwx|(px mx ) (px+ mx+)maxx minx|, where w=(wid,wx1, ,wxn) is the weight vector; wid is the weight for non-identical SLAs; wx is the weight, and maxx and minx the maximum and minimum values of differences px mx for parameter x."
The rules have been implemented using the Java rule engine Drools [41]_CITE
"For this, we extended the workload generator as described in [7]_CITE to allow a categorization of data volatility."
"Thus, Cloud computing infrastructures offer a promising way to host these sorts of applications [10]_CITE"
The monitoring data presented in this Section was gathered with the help of the Cloud monitoring framework Lom2His [3]_CITE
"Using Lom2His we measured utilized resources of TopHat [45]_CITE, a typical bioinformatics workflow application analyzing RNA-Seq data [46]_CITE, for a duration of about three hours [9]_CITE."
"The aligner presented here, TopHat [45]_CITE, consists of many sub-tasks, some of them have to be executed sequentially, whereas others can run in parallel ( Fig_10 )"
The first sub-task aligns input reads to the given genome using the Bowtie program [47]_CITE
"Normally, when setting up such a testbed as described in [9]_CITE, an initial guess of possible resource consumption is done based on early monitoring data"
"For example, in the studies on the automated segmentation from magnetic resonance images [19 21]_CITE, the number of training examples is very huge (up to millions), the classes are strongly imbalanced, and generating accurate statistical solution is not trivial"
"In addition, data imbalance in huge data sets is also reported in other applicative domains, such as marketing data [22]_CITE, oil spill detection or land cover changes from remote sensing images [16,27]_CITE, text classification [18]_CITE and scene classification [35]_CITE"
Many classification algorithms present great limitations on large data sets and show a performance degradation due to class imbalance [14]_CITE
"Moreover, SVM classification performance can be hindered by class imbalance [1,30]_CITE"
"In fact, it is prone to generate classifier that has a strong estimation bias toward the majority class: since the number of majority class patterns exceeds that of the minority class, the class boundary becomes vulnerable to be distorted [15]_CITE"
"Nevertheless, these limitations are common to many other classification schemes such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) [7]_CITE and Logistic Regression (LR) [23]_CITE."
This potential drawback comes dramatically true when the number of minority class patterns is very small [15]_CITE
"Several methods to select examples in a classification problem are presented in literature, using two different approaches: the example-selection method can be embedded within the learning algorithm or the examples can be filtered before passing them to the classification scheme [2,26]_CITE"
"It is worth noting that the first type of selection methods generally work by preserving the original ratio between classes [6,11]_CITE: if there is a great skew in the data, it continues to be"
Numerous algorithms can be used taking into account the class-membership of samples to solve the imbalance in the data [2]_CITE
"More recently, a method focused on both big and class imbalanced data classification was proposed [29]_CITE"
"It is based on the computation of Tomek links [31]_CITE, defined as a pair of nearest neighbors of opposite classes"
"A first approach consists of modifying SVM algorithm in order to make faster the training on large data sets; for example, Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) breaks the large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems [25]_CITE, allowing SMO to handle large training sets [25]_CITE"
"The effects of imbalanced data on SVM are related to the soft-margin maximization paradigm [1]_CITE: since SVM tries to minimize total error, it is biased toward the majority concept"
"In the worst case, SVM will classify all examples as pertaining to the majority class, a tactic that, if the imbalance is severe, can provide the minimal error rate across the data space [12]_CITE"
"Most of them assign different error costs to different classes in order to shift the decision boundary and to guarantee that it is better defined [1,12]_CITE"
Another major category of kernel-based learning research efforts focuses more concretely on the mechanics of the SVM itself; this group of methods is often called kernel modification methods [12]_CITE
In [30]_CITE the Granular Support Vector Machines - Repetitive Undersampling algorithm (GSVM-RU) was proposed to integrate SVM learning with undersampling methods
"The three real data sets have been extracted from the Forest Cover Type data set of the UCI repository [5]_CITE having 7 classes and 581,012 samples"
"This can be considered as a good performance in terms of simple accuracy, but this is of no use since the classifier does not catch any important information on the patterns of the minority class [12]_CITE"
"Intuitively, precision is a measure of exactness (ie, of the examples predicted as positive, how many are actually labelled correctly), whereas recall is a measure of completeness (ie, how many examples of the positive class were labelled correctly) [12]_CITE"
"In clinical application, high recall values are important where the test is used to identify a serious but tractable disease [17]_CITE"
The precision of a test is very useful to clinicians since it answers the question: How likely is it that this patient has the disease given that the test result is positive? [17]_CITE
"These metrics are simple and useful summary measures of overlapping between actual and predicted labels, which are interestingly applied to studies of reproducibility and accuracy in medical image segmentation [36]_CITE"
"Most of the methods are based on the reconstruction of the data by solving large systems of equations ( Feichtinger_et_al.,_1995;_Grishin_and_Strohmer,_2004_CITE)"
Nielson_(1993)_CITE presented an overview of several approximation techniques for non-uniform point sets
"They have been used in surface ( Ohtake_et_al.,_2004_CITE) as well as volumetric ( Jang_et_al.,_2006_CITE) approximation and reconstruction techniques."
Arigovindan_et_al._(2005)_CITE proposed to use B-splines in a multi-grid framework for the reconstruction of non-uniform 2D data
"Vu ini_et_al._(2008,_2009)_CITE extended these ideas to 3D volumes and large datasets"
"For general shift-invariant spaces a Beurling density D 1 is necessary for a stable and perfect reconstruction ( Aldroubi_and_Gr chenig,_2000_CITE)"
"The related literature is mainly related to the problem of surface reconstruction ( Stelldinger_et_al.,_2007;_Meine_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
"Recently, Vu ini_et_al._(2009)_CITE proposed the usage of the avg concept for selecting an optimal resolution of reconstruction"
"Topology analysis has been successfully linked to fields related to isosurface selection ( Bajaj_et_al.,_1997;_Takahashi_et_al.,_2004_CITE), topological downsampling and simplification ( Kraus_and_Ertl,_2001;_Gyulassy_et_al.,_2005;_Natarajan_and_Pascucci,_2005_CITE), topology-guided analysis and navigation in scalar and time varying data ( Weber_et_al.,_2007;_Bremer_et_al.,_2010_CITE), and feature tracking and evolution ( Silver_and_Wang,_1998;_Weber_et_al.,_2009_CITE)"
Carr_et_al._(2010)_CITE have presented a generalized framework consolidating the theory and application of the contour spectrum concept
"Our approach derives homological statistics by computing the Betti numbers, which in turn are connected to Morse theory since they are upper-bounded by the respective number of critical points ( Matsumoto,_2001_CITE)"
"Recently, Bendich_et_al._(2010)_CITE have introduced the persistence diagram, an analysis tool for displaying topological information of higher dimensions"
"In order to determine the B-spline coefficients the following cost function is minimized: (2)C(F)= i=0M-1 F(p)-fi 2+ DpF 2dxdydzwhere is a parameter that controls the smoothness and the second term is the regularization functional that uses Duchon seminorms D p F ( Duchon,_1979_CITE)."
"Betti numbers are topological features, proved to be invariants with regard to continuous deformation, and used to extend the polyhedral formula to higher dimensional spaces ( Munkres,_1984_CITE)"
") t}This structure is less influenced by noise and will allow us to study the stability of Betti numbers over different data-ranges (in the sense of persistence Edelsbrunner_et_al.,_2002_CITE)"
"The extraction of the homological information related to the Betti numbers is performed in cubical cells, ie uniform volumes, as described by Kaczynski_et_al._(2004)_CITE"
"The visualization of this simulation is of great importance to better analyze how the bypass of the Tollmien Schlichting (TS) waves develops ( Schlatter,_2001_CITE)"
Vu ini_et_al._(2009)_CITE selected an optimal resolution of 766 92 192 based on their avg assumption
We see that the suggested resolutions by the proposed topology-controller vary 15% from the results presented by Vu ini_et_al._(2009)_CITE
"A typical forecasting process includes pre-processing and analysis of the data, which are usually in the form of time series, extrapolating the series with a suitable statistical method ( Petropoulos,_Makridakis,_Assimakopoulos,_&_Nikolopoulos,_2014_CITE), post-processing the statistical forecasts and monitoring and evaluating the outputs"
"This paper focuses on the third, post-processing, stage of the forecasting process, and more specifically on the judgmental interventions on statistical forecasts that are typically performed by demand planners and managers ( Fildes_&_Goodwin,_2007b_CITE)"
"Such interventions are common, with Fildes,_Goodwin,_Lawrence,_and_Nikolopoulos_(2009)_CITE reporting that 91 percent of the forecasts examined in one organisation were subject to judgmental adjustments"
Franses_and_Legerstee_(2009)_CITE reported similar findings.
"First, managers attempt to incorporate into the forecasts the expected impact of forthcoming special events, such as promotional activities, strikes, or the launch of a competiting new product ( Fildes_&_Goodwin,_2007a_CITE)"
"Arguably, more formal methods that include external regressors could sometimes be used for this purpose ( Huang,_Fildes,_&_Soopramanien,_2014_CITE)"
"Second, demand planners may tend to change statistical forecasts in order to be in-line with budgeting or politically-related targets set by senior managers ( Fildes_&_Goodwin,_2007b_CITE)"
"For example, in a field study Lawrence,_O Connor,_and_Edmundson_(2000)_CITE questioned whether forecast accuracy was the primary objective of their company-based forecasters and suggested that their forecasts were heavily influenced by political choices within the company framework"
"Despite this, a recent survey by Fildes_and_Petropoulos_(2015)_CITE showed that accuracy is generally the most important driver in the forecasting process, confirming earlier studies (for example see: McCarthy,_Davis,_Golicic,_&_Mentzer,_2006_CITE)"
"Third, managers may adjust in order to gain a sense of ownership of the forecasts, possibly as a result of a lack of trust in the statistical methods, which they may regard as black-boxes ( nkal_&_G n l,_2005_CITE)"
"Lastly, humans are liable to confuse the signal with the noise ( Harvey,_1995_CITE) and introduce unnecessary judgmental adjustments as the result of perceived systematic changes that were not captured by the statistical methods ( Goodwin_&_Fildes,_1999_CITE)."
"See Lawrence,_Goodwin,_O Connor,_and_Onkal_(2006)_CITE and Leitner_and_Leopold-Wildburger_(2011)_CITE for reviews of progress in judgmental forecasting"
"Recently, researchers in behavioural operational research ( H m l inen,_Luoma,_&_Saarinen,_2013_CITE) have focused on finding links between forecasting performance and experts behaviour (for example see: de Bruijn_&_Franses,_2012_CITE)"
"Similarly, research on corporate earnings forecasting has examined the behavioural determinants of observed biases ( Ramnath,_Rock,_&_Shane,_2008_CITE)"
"In an interesting study by Smith,_Levere,_and_Kurtzman_(2009)_CITE, poker players were found to change their strategy after significant wins or losses"
"Similar behaviours have been found in sports gambling ( Xu_&_Harvey,_2014_CITE) and in financial markets ( Coval_&_Shumway,_2005;_Garvey,_Murphy,_&_Wu,_2007_CITE)"
"A few decades ago, most researchers discouraged managers from making judgmental adjustments to statistical forecasts because it was believed that they would generally damage accuracy ( Armstrong,_1985;_Carbone,_Andersen,_Corriveau,_&_Corson,_1983_CITE)"
"These researchers found evidence that judgment was associated with a wide range of biases including over-optimism, anchoring ( Eroglu_&_Croxton,_2010_CITE), overconfidence ( Blattberg_&_Hoch,_1990;_Kottemann,_Davis,_&_Remus,_1994_CITE), inconsistency, and confusion of the signal with the noise ( Eggleton,_1982;_O Connor,_Remus,_&_Griggs,_1993_CITE)."
"Mathews and Diamantopoulos were the first to show empirically through a series of company-based studies ( Mathews_&_Diamantopoulos,_1986;_1989;_1990_CITE) that forecast manipulation can lead to improvements in accuracy"
"Other researchers have provided further evidence on the efficacy of judgmentally adjusted forecasts in macroeconomics ( Donihue,_1993;_McNees,_1990;_Turner,_1990_CITE), accounting earnings ( Brown,_1988_CITE) and business forecasting ( Vere_&_Griffiths,_1995;_Wolfe_&_Flores,_1990_CITE)"
"Syntetos,_Nikolopoulos,_and_Boylan_(2010)_CITE showed that in addition to the improvements in performance as measured by traditional error metrics, judgmental adjustments of demand forecasts also result in significant reductions in inventory costs"
"However, two key elements affecting the success of an intervention are the reliability and importance of the missing information ( Goodwin_&_Fildes,_1999_CITE) and the requirement that humans should not discount reliable statistical forecasts ( Donihue,_1993_CITE)."
"Smith_et al._(2009)_CITE found that, after large losses in games of poker, players engaged in more aggressive and riskier gambles (see also Xu_&_Harvey,_2014_CITE)"
"While, not making an adjustment when it was warranted would risk one being guilty of an act of omission, there is evidence that an erroneous act of commission is seen as worse than an erroneous act of omission ( Spranca,_Minsk,_&_Baron,_1991_CITE)."
"Also, traditional poker players are likely to be engaged in one game at a time while most demand forecasters will have the task of forecasting many series ( Fildes_&_Goodwin,_2007b_CITE) over long periods so that a large forecast error in one series at one point in time will be less prominent than the consequences of a poor judgment in poker."
"For example, experts reputations are more easily lost than gained ( Bonaccio_&_Dalal,_2006_CITE)"
"While prospect theory ( Tversky_&_Kahneman,_1992_CITE) suggests that people do tend to risk even further losses to try to negate current loss, the idea of forecasters making a large reckless adjustment to a forecast for an individual product in order to recover their reputation, because their previous adjustment had significantly damaged accuracy, seems less plausible"
"First, it is known that forecasters have a tendency to overreact to outcome feedback, which will, in part, reflect the noise in a time series ( Lawrence_et al.,_2006_CITE)"
"This may in part relate to the gambler fallacy where chance events are perceived to be self-correcting ( Smith_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"For example, this may occur when, in order to meet customer service targets, decisions are made to hold inventory at two standard deviations above expected sales but these decisions are represented as forecasts of expected demand ( Fildes_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"There is also evidence that people are reluctant to modify a previous act of commission and persist in pursuing the same action ( Staw,_1976_CITE)"
"This can occur despite evidence that continuing the action is counterproductive ( Lim_&_O Connor,_1995_CITE)"
"Following the poker analogy ( Smith_et al.,_2009_CITE), a large loss may have negative effects on a forecaster confidence in his or her ability to contribute to forecast accuracy for a given product"
H1 implies that forecasters are likely to pay attention to the latest loss and this is also fairly supported by responses to a questionnaire administered by Boulaksil_and_Franses_(2009)_CITE
Franses_and_Legerstee_(2011a)_CITE examine the effectiveness of linearly combining the statistical and expert forecasts
Hyndman_and_Koehler_(2006)_CITE define the relative error as the ratio of the forecast error deriving from a method whose performance is to be measured divided by the error of a benchmark method
"This is an important property which provides a direct relationship of the with a recently introduced error measure (Average Relative Mean Absolute Error or AvgRelMAE, Davydenko_&_Fildes,_2013_CITE) for evaluating judgmentally adjusted forecasts across different periods and multiple time series."
"This is in line with previous studies on the same database, where it was found that, when averaged across countries and categories of products, only in 43 percent of the cases expert forecasts were better than statistical ones ( Franses_&_Legerstee,_2010_CITE)"
"An analysis of this data set by Franses,_Legerstee,_and_Paap_(2011)_CITE concluded that there was evidence that the experts forecasts were subject to asymmetric loss"
"If the forecasters judgments were being distorted by unreliable information this would not be consistent with the results of a laboratory study by Remus,_O Connor,_and_Griggs_(1998)_CITE which found that judgmental forecasters were not necessarily misled by incorrect information"
"For example, wishful thinking may lead to the discounting of negative information if an increase in sales is desired ( Tyebjee,_1987_CITE)"
"A desire to produce forecasts that are politically acceptable to senior managers may have a similar effect on how information is interpreted and whether it is discounted ( Fildes_&_Hastings,_1994_CITE)."
"While generally big losses are observed more frequently after positive adjustments (a result that corroborates with Fildes_et al._(2009)_CITE), there are no significant differences in subsequent experts behaviour linked with the direction of the adjustment at the previous period"
"The AvgRelMAE is applied after considering a symmetric trimmed mean so that any extreme values are eliminated, as suggested by Davydenko_and_Fildes_(2013)_CITE"
"The illusion of control is a well known disadvantage in management judgment ( Kottemann_et al.,_1994_CITE)"
"This strategy is also known as the Blattberg Hoch approach and is based on the argument that any combinations of forecasts proves more accurate than the single inputs ( Blattberg_&_Hoch,_1990_CITE)"
"In the case of judgmental adjustments, though, it acts as a dampener on the adjustments ( Fildes_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"In any case, it has shown promising performance when applied for combining statistical and expert forecasts ( Fildes_et al.,_2009;_Franses_&_Legerstee,_2011a_CITE)"
"While Franses_and_Legerstee_(2011a)_CITE applied it unconditionally on the same database examined in this study, Fildes_et al._(2009)_CITE identified positive adjustments as those benefiting from the 50 50 percent strategy"
"For example, a review of the behavioural newsvendor type experiments in the context of examining medical operations room scheduling shows repetitive error prone behaviour despite feedback ( Wachtel_&_Dexter,_2010_CITE)"
"There is also evidence of experimental participants rejecting models in favour of their own (mis)judgments even when given evidence on the superior performance of models ( Dietvorst,_Simmons,_&_Massey,_2015_CITE)"
"As H m l inen_et al._(2013)_CITE remark, a key issue of behavioural OR is how to help people find better strategies in problem-solving situations, overcoming the biases that typically intrude"
"For example, the use of error bootstrap rules ( Fildes_et al.,_2009_CITE) or correlation with experts experience and/or behaviour ( Franses_&_Legerstee,_2011a_CITE) could be considered as alternatives"
"The strategy of responding to big losses could be thought of as a simple monitoring scheme which could be compared to regular methods of monitoring such as tracking signals ( Gorr_&_Ord,_2009_CITE)"
"To that end, a possibility for future research would be to examine the effectiveness of providing feedback on adjustments that led to big losses, as explicit feedback to experts on their performance has been shown to lead to more accurate forecasts ( Legerstee_&_Franses,_2014_CITE)."
"Soft-biometrics traits are defined as anatomical or behavioural characteristics that provides some information about the identity of a person, but does not provide sufficient evidence to precisely determine the identity [1]_CITE"
"These traits have been used within biometrics deployment in combination with hard-biometrics modalities such as fingerprint [2]_CITE, iris [3]_CITE and face [4]_CITE"
Studies have shown that the use of a soft-biometrics can enhance biometrics system performance and can greatly decrease search time in large databases [1]_CITE
"Whilst soft-biometrics are high level cues and as such are largely incapable of differentiating one individual from another, their use has been proposed for deployment within continuous authentication scenarios [5]_CITE"
"The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community are looking to the prediction of traits (eg sex, age, handedness, emotional states) as a way to enhance the interaction between computer-based systems and users [6]_CITE"
"For example, the use of dynamic keystroke and mouse movement information has been suggested as a way to predict the level of stress of computer users [7]_CITE"
There has also been attempts to predict emotional states such as happiness from dynamic keystroke data [8]_CITE
These capture capabilities have been used to develop more secured means of authentication through swipe gestures [10 13]_CITE
"More recently, in [11]_CITE the authors combine the idea of a use of Android lock pattern authentication with the dynamics of drawing such a pattern"
"The use of touch graphical passwords for tablets with multi-touch-screens has been also analysed in [12]_CITE, where the dynamic information of multi-touch input sequence were analysed for user authentication"
This work has also been used to obtain a US Patent [14]_CITE.
In [13]_CITE the authors explore the possibilities of swipe gesture data (combined with accelerometer data) to perform continuous user identification for mobile devices
"Another example of continuous authentication using swipe gesture can be found at [15]_CITE, where the authors presented the FAST (Finger-gestures Authentication System using Touchscreen) framework"
"In 1997, Wayman [16]_CITE proposed the use of soft-biometrics in order to optimise search in large surveillance databases"
"Since then, soft-biometrics have continuously received the attention of the biometrics research community [1]_CITE"
Soft-biometrics data can help improve biometrics systems [17]_CITE and also can be used to tailored applications and the information displayed based on user's characteristics
"Face images have been comprehensively analysed for sex prediction [18]_CITE, reaching accuracy rates of 99% using frontal face images and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier [19]_CITE"
"In [20]_CITE, the authors analysed sex prediction from unconstrained face images in which there was a high level of variation in viewpoint, pose, articulation and occlusion from the images, simulating a personal photo album"
"Gait-based sex prediction has also obtained a high accuracy rate: 98%, based on video sequences of a person walking from 11 different camera views in the same scene [21]_CITE."
In a study by Amayeh et al [22]_CITE the authors examined hand features to obtain sex prediction as a soft-biometric
"From iris images, it has been possible to obtain an accuracy rate of 91% analysing iris texture using a local binary pattern and SVM classifier [23]_CITE"
In [24]_CITE a method used on fingerprint images based on discrete wavelets transform and singular value decomposition is proposed
Idrus et al [25]_CITE conducted a thorough analysis for profiling users from keystroke data

"The SSD is a comprehensive multi-modal biometrics dataset (face, iris, swipe, keystroke, signature, gait, hand, voice and fingerprint) along with demographics (such as sex, height, weight, handedness) created for the SuperIdentity project [27]_CITE"
"In [28]_CITE, the authors concluded that swipe features are linked to specific physical characteristics of the hand"
The WEKA machine learning suite has been successfully used in a broad range of scientific fields from speech segmentation [30]_CITE to medical domains [31]_CITE.
"Despite its over-simplified and generally unrealistic assumptions, the naive Bayes classifier has been shown to perform remarkably well in a wide range of applications such as text classification [38]_CITE and internet traffic identification [39]_CITE."
Fusion techniques are commonly used in multi-biometrics systems [40]_CITE
"The classical coupled thermoelasticity theory proposed by Biot [1]_CITE with the introduction of the strain-rate term in the Fourier heat conduction equation leads to a parabolic-type heat conduction equation, called the diffusion equation"
"To overcome such an absurdity, generalized thermoelasticity theories have been propounded by Lord and hulman [2]_CITE as well as Green and Lindsay [3]_CITE advocating the existence of finite thermal wave speed in solids"
"Brief reviews of this topic have been reported by Chandrasekharaiah [4,5]_CITE"
The coupled theory of thermoelasticity has been extended by including the thermal relaxanon time in the constitutive equations by Lord and Shulman [2]_CITE and Green and Lindsay [3]_CITE
The magneto-thermoelastic disturbances generated by a thermal shock in an elastic half-space having a finite conductivity has been investigated by Puri [6]_CITE
Among the authors who considered the generalized magneto-thermoelastic equations are Nayfeh and Nemat-Nasser [7]_CITE who studied the propagation of plane waves in a solid under the influence of an electromagnetic field
Choudhuri [8]_CITE extended these results to rotating media
Ezzat [9]_CITE has studied the problem of generation of generalized magneto-thermoelastic waves by thermal shock in a perfectly conducting half-space
Ezzat et al [10]_CITE have established the model of two dimensional equations of generalized magneto-thermoelasticity
However Bahar and Hetnarski [11 12]_CITE outlined several disadvantages of the potential function approach
This state space approach has been further developed in Sherief [14]_CITE to include the effect of heat sources
He et al [15]_CITE surveyed a two-dimensional thermal shock problem for a semi-infinite piezoelectric rod using state space approach
Youssef and El-bary [16]_CITE put forward an analysis for a generalized thermoelastic infinite layer problem under three theories using state space approach
State space formulation to the vibration of gold nano-beam in femtoseconds scale was done by Elsibai and Youssef [17]_CITE.
"The theory of heat conduction in a deformable body, formulated by Chen and Gurtin [18]_CITE and Chen et al [19,20]_CITE depends on two different temperatures the conductive temperature and the thermo dynamical temperature"
Chen et al [21]_CITE have suggested that the difference between these two temperatures is proportional to heat supply
"The existence, structural stability, convergence and spatial behaviour of two temperature thermoelasticity have been provided by Quintanilla [22]_CITE"
"One can find several two-dimensional works based on the generalized thermoelasticity by using the normal mode analysis in the literatures Ezzat and Abd Elall [30]_CITE, Othman and Lotfy [31 32]_CITE, Lofty and Othman [33]_CITE, Lofty [34]_CITE and Sarkar and Lahiri [35]_CITE"
"The normal mode analysis [30 34]_CITE was used to obtain the exact expression for the temperature distribution, thermal stresses, and the displacement components."
"The heat conduction equation takes the form [23]_CITE (9)K ,ii= t+ 0 2 t2( CET+ T0ui,j)"
"The relation between the heat conduction and the dynamical heat takes the form (12) -T=a ,ii,where a> 0 two-temperature parameter, Youssef [23]_CITE."
"Modern trends in manufacturing are defined by mass customization, small lot sizes, high variability of product types, and a changing product portfolio during the lifecycle of an automated production system (aPS) ( L der_et al.,_2005;_Rzevski,_2003_CITE)"
"These trends imply more complex aPS ( Mcfarlane_and_Bussmann,_2000_CITE), which support changes in the physical layout of the aPS including extensive technical updates"
"Since the proportion of system functionality that is realized by software is increasing ( Thramboulidis,_2010_CITE), concepts for supporting automation engineers in handling this complexity are strongly required"
"Software as well as software engineering in this domain need to fulfill specific requirements, eg regarding real-time and reliability ( Vogel-Heuser_et al.,_2014a,_2014b,_2014c_CITE)"
"aPS are comprised of mechanical parts, electrical and electronic parts (automation hardware) and software, all closely interwoven, and thus represent a special class of mechatronic systems ( Bonf _and_Fantuzzi,_2003;_Rzevski,_2003_CITE) and consist of mechatronic sub-systems like sensors and actuators"
Lehman_(1980)_CITE defined laws of software evolution and among others identified that systems are subject to dynamics causing continuing changes of software resulting into increasing complexity
"Hence, due to their evolution and the long-living character of aPs, their life is characterized as a cycle ( Birkhofer_et al.,_2010_CITE)"
"Software maintainability is the ease with which a software system can be modified to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes or adapt to change environments ( IEC,_1990_CITE)"
"Accordingly, maintenance can either involve repair or modification actions, which in turn can be adjustments to the environment (referred to as adaptive maintenance) or augmentation of a system's function ( Avizienis_et al.,_2004_CITE)"
"In the context of maintainability, obsolescence management, ie, managing, mitigating and resolving the impact of (sub-)component obsolescence, is one important issue regarding long-living systems ( ISO/IEC_25010,_2011_CITE)."
"Buckley_et al._(2005)_CITE introduced four aspects of software changes as the basis for software evolution: temporal properties (when), object of change (where does the change occur), system properties (what), and change support (how)"
"The authors neglect the stake-holders (who) and the reason for change (why), which is essential to address the nature of [the] evolution phenomenon, its drivers and impact ( Lehman_and_Ramil,_2002_CITE)"
An approach to explicitly modeling changes of aPS' physical structures and for analyzing their effects on the system's functions is proposed in G ring_and_Fay_(2013)_CITE alongwith the physical causes of these changes
"According to Wiendahl_et al._(2007)_CITE, changeability is defined as characteristics to accomplish early and foresighted adjustments of the factory's structure and processes"
"In contrast, reconfigurability is defined as the ability of a manufacturing or assembly system to switch with minimal effort and delay to a particular family of workpieces or subassemblies through the addition or removal of functional elements ( Wiendahl_et al.,_2007_CITE)."
"Drivers for evolution are manifold ( Westk mper,_2003_CITE), and basically result in changes of requirements on the aPS ( Legat_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"Managing (evolving) functional requirements is a well-studied topic in the literature ( Ramesh_and_Jarke,_2001_CITE)"
"In contrast, managing non-functional requirements especially dependability requirements for aPS is rarely addressed ( Fay_et al.,_2015;_Ladiges_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"One reason is that the relationship between evolution and dependability of a system is vaguely understood until now because both are very complex challenges ( Felici,_2003;_Machado_et al.,_2006;_Vogel-Heuser_et al.,_2014c_CITE)"
The restructuring of a production unit versus a continuous improvement process of these units is another topic in this field ( Schuh_et._al_2013_CITE)
"The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, the development process for aPS according to VDI/VDE_3695 (2010)_CITE is presented introducing classified evolution scenarios and a simple pick and place unit (PPU) as application example"
"aPS are typically designed-to-order, ie they are unique systems, which are designed and implemented once a customer has awarded a contract to an aPS supplier ( Birkhofer_et al.,_2010_CITE)"
"The specification and implementation is carried out in the form of a project ( VDI/VDE_3695_Part_2,_2010_CITE)"
"upper part of Fig_1), as described eg in VDI/VDE_2206_(2004)_CITE, and is decoupled from the projects on the timeline"
"dashed arrows in Fig_1) ( VDI/VDE_3695_Part_2,_2010_CITE)."
"The categorization is based on and extends the one introduced in Ladiges_et al._(2013_CITE), Vogel-Heuser_et al._(2014c_CITE) and ( 2014d_CITE)."
"As depicted in the lower rows of Table 1, the scenario categories can be related to the definitions introduced by Buckley_et al._(2005)_CITE: history of change, granularity of change ( Buckley_et al.,_2005;_Katzke_et al.,_2004_CITE), history of change and anticipation of change"
"Anticipated software changes in accordance to Buckley_et al._(2005_CITE) are software changes, which can be foreseen during the initial development of the systems and, as such, can be accommodated in the design decision taken"
"Unanticipated software changes according to Buckley_et al._(2005_CITE) are not foreseen during the development phase, but they are frequently undertaken at short notice during commissioning and operation in order to, eg, clear defects in other disciplines, such as an unexpected behavior of the mechanics"
"The PPU performs a manufacturing (discrete) process and handles, stamps and sorts different kinds of workpieces ( Fig_3) ( Vogel-Heuser_et al.,_2014d_CITE)"
"Regarding Buckley_et al.'s_(2005_CITE) criteria temporal change, also history of change is introduced with the characteristic sequential and parallel synchronous and parallel asynchronous changes"
"In the following, parallel evolution is discussed according to Buckley_et al.'s_(2005_CITE) criterion history of change"
"To realize remote service functionality, data logging and analysis techniques are required as well as the possibility to remotely access operational data ( Vogel-Heuser_et al.,_2014c_CITE)."
"Requirements engineering in general includes the activities of identifying, documenting, verifying and validating, coordinating, and managing requirements ( Pohl_&_Rupp,_2011_CITE)"
"Accordingly, the development of requirements on a production plant is an integrated part of the production design ( Blanchard,_2004;_Buede,_2000_CITE)"
"In the development process model described in (VDI/VDE_2206,_2004)_CITE (cp"
"Similarly, other common development process models like the spiral model ( Sage_and_Rouse,_2009_CITE) (for software-intensive systems) or the waterfall model include requirements elicitation and specification as a (repetitive) action during engineering"
"Requirements can be categorized as functional requirements, quality requirements, and external conditions ( Pohl_and_Rupp,_2011_CITE)."
"The functional requirements can usually be derived from the product that has to be produced ( Vyatkin,_2013_CITE) and are the minimum set of requirements to be specified completely describing the design problem ( Braha_and_Maimon,_1997_CITE)"
"They refer to the main intention and are the nonnegotiable characteristics of the desired solution ( Braha_and_Maimon,_1997_CITE)"
"Therefore, the production development phase is often performed subsequently to the product development phase and is part of the product realization ( Bellgran_and_S fsten,_2010_CITE)"
"Quality requirements, also called non-functional requirements or extra-functional requirements, are usually more general and include, among others, performance requirements expressed in Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (see eg ISO_22400-2,_2012_CITE), flexibility requirements, reliability and availability requirements, safety and security requirements, and maintainability requirements ( ISO/IEC_25010,_2011_CITE)."
"This was, for example, shown in a survey regarding requirements engineering practice for software projects in industry by Neill_and_Laplante_(2003)_CITE"
"Morris_et al._(1998)_CITE, identified the following reasons for missing requirements engineering practices in research and development projects in industry: Missing training due to lack of time and cost"
"As shown by Frey_and_Litz_(2000_CITE) in the example of the specification of PLC code, the formalization of requirements is often omitted in practice"
"Different expert surveys with manufacturing companies showed that structured and systematic ways of working in aPS development are missing ( Bellgran_and_S fsten,_2010_CITE)"
"Additionally, a study by Bellgran_and_S fsten_(2010_CITE) showed that only a few companies formulated a thorough requirements specification before system development started"
Reasons named by Bellgran_and_S fsten_(2010_CITE) are mainly high time-pressure and low priority despite of the assumption that a well performed requirements engineering helps reducing time for fixing design and implementation errors
"Unfortunately, the adaptation of the formal specification is often omitted, especially when changes need to be implemented within a short time window and during operation ( Vogel-Heuser_et al.,_2014a_CITE)"
All other requirements mentioned in ISO/IEC_25010_(2011)_CITE do not have intensified influence on aPS but have to be considered as well
"The main requirements to be considered are reliability, performance efficiency, compatibility, maintainability and portability ( Frank_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"The most important ones are resource utilization, time behavior, testability and analyzability ( Frank_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"General sources of requirements are usually stakeholders, documents, and systems in operation ( Pohl_and_Rupp,_2011_CITE)"
"Their requirements have to be communicated in a way allowing systematically documenting and analyzing the requirements ( Pohl_and_Rupp,_2011_CITE)"
"Common techniques are conducting surveys and interviews, performing brainstorming, and using checklists ( Blanchard,_2004_CITE)"
"Further methods, like eg the quality function deployment ( Chan_and_Wu,_2002_CITE), are proposed by research"
"However, which practices are really performed is project and company specific ( Bellgran_and_S fsten,_2010_CITE)."
"Following the IEEE Guide for Developing System Requirements Specification , first raw requirements result, among others, in documents describing the concept of operation as well as the system concept in an informal and rough manner which are to be developed with the customer ( IEEE-Standard_1233,_1998_CITE)"
"These documents should already describe the requirements (1) unambiguously and consistently, (2) in a clear structure, (3) modifiable and extendable, (4) completely, and (5) traceably ( Pohl_and_Rupp,_2011_CITE)"
"This kind of description is also called well defined requirements , and ill-defined requirements may be transformed in a refinement procedure ( Braha_and_Maimon,_1997_CITE)"
"Different literature proposes different document types for the requirements documentation, as for example Blanchard_(2004_CITE), Buede_(2000_CITE), IEEE-Standard_1220_(1999_CITE), IEEE-Standard_1233_(1998_CITE) and Pohl_and_Rupp_(2011_CITE)."
"Haubeck_et al._(2013_CITE), for example, derive four stages in the requirement hierarchy of a single system"
"Similar hierarchies can be found in the other literatures, like Blanchard_(2004_CITE) and IEEE-Standard_1220_(1999_CITE)"
"Translating the originating requirements into a formal description results in the system specification which is a first description of how the requirements are to be realized ( VDI/VDE_3694,_2008_CITE)"
"Formalization may be a first refinement of the informal requirements ( VDI/VDE_3694,_2008_CITE)"
"However, informal requirements sometimes need to be defined on several or each hierarchical level ( IEEE-Standard_1233,_1998_CITE)."
"Formalization usually results in a set of models, and the variety of used models is huge, and the choice of the right model type depends on the domain, industry branch, as well as the specific plant to be designed ( VDI/VDE_3681,_2005_CITE)"
"For many aPS in operation, a formal specification has never been provided ( Frey_and_Litz,_2000_CITE)"
"This often includes that no assessment of the quality of changes is done because of lack of time, or cost constraints, or missing measurements ( Bellgran_and_S fsten,_2010_CITE)"
"An approach to narrow the knowledge gap, or even to close it, is by establishing an automatic linkage between evolving plant behavior occurring due to performed changes and formally specified requirements in order to keep specifications up to date and consistent ( Haubeck_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"This helps keeping specifications up to date even after undocumented evolution steps ( Haubeck_et al.,_2013_CITE)."
"These properties can be operationalized in a way that they are measurable by the available online measurements ( Ladiges_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"In summary, the approach described in Haubeck_et al._(2013)_CITE enables a requirement verification during operation by (1) building models out of online measurements, (2) derive plant properties out of these models, and (3) check those properties against specified limits."
Feldmann_et al._(2014b)_CITE presented a light weight notational approach (cp
"Referring to the self-healing scenario Sc12f of the PPU in Section 2.2 and the above mentioned challenge to include NFR into requirements modeling of aPS, the light weighted approach of Feldmann_et al._(2014b)_CITE is introduced"
"To increase the quality of requirements R sch_et al._(2015)_CITE and Teufl_and_Hackenberg_(2015)_CITE introduced description of behavior based on MSCs included in the MIRA ( Broy_and_St len,_2001_CITE) approach and UML SD"
"In mechanical systems, interfaces can be distinguished as material, information, energy flows ( Pahl_and_Beitz,_1997_CITE)"
"While engineering approaches exist in the different disciplines to address these problems (eg, architectural description languages in software engineering Medvidovic_and_Taylor_(2000)_CITE, the problems become more difficult to identify and solve if a change in one discipline's parts results in problems in another discipline"
"The complete system design covers different aspects ( Goldschmidt_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"As an example, Fig_7 shows a fault tree of one of the PPU's evolution scenarios ( Vogel-Heuser_et al.,_2014c_CITE)"
"Getir_et al._(2013)_CITE show, also on the PPU case study, that the evolution between system architecture and fault frees cannot be automated and that instead expertise from engineers is required to correctly evolve both the system architecture and the system's fault trees to ensure consistency."
"Recently, the term technical debt has been coined ( Kruchten_et al.,_2012_CITE) for the effects when sub-optimal solutions are chosen to meet short-term goals similar to financial debt"
"In a multiple-case embedded system case study in 5 large software companies ( Martini_et al.,_2014_CITE), different factors for architectural technical debt have been identified, like pressure to deliver, prioritization of features over products, non-complete refactoring, or technology evolution"
"CONSENS ( Anacker_et al.,_2011_CITE) CONceptual design Specification technique for ENgineering of complex Systems is a method and specification language that targets the overall, discipline independent system design"
"Based on the identification of these changes, Rieke presents an approach to synchronize changes between the high-level specification of CONSENS and the discipline-specific specifications to ensure consistency between them using Triple Graph Grammars ( Rieke,_2015_CITE)."
"The MechatronicUML ( Heinzemann_et al.,_2013_CITE) is a modeling language and process for the engineering of mechatronic systems"
"It is based on a rigorous specification of structure and behavior based on a refinement of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) ( Object_Management_Group,_2011_CITE)"
"Another approach for ensuring the consistency in the design of embedded automation systems is the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) ( Object_Management_Group,_2012;_Weilkiens,_2008_CITE), which is a profile for the UML"
"SysML4Mechatronics ( Kernschmidt_and_Vogel-Heuser,_2013_CITE) is a language for interdisciplinary modeling, which addresses mechanical, electrical/electronic and software aspects in product automation and for aPS explicitly"
"A formal semantics for automatic verification of structural compatibility has been proposed ( Feldmann_et al.,_2014a_CITE), but verifying functional conformance is not considered yet"
Shah_et al._(2010)_CITE present a multi-discipline modeling framework based on SysML
"A formal modeling framework for verifying aPS' engineering models has been proposed in ( Hackenberg_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
"For modeling these viewpoints, the modeling framework relies on the Focus theory ( Broy_and_St len,_2001_CITE) which provides strict formal semantics."
"One major language for the definition of consistency constraints is the Object Constraint Language OCL ( Object_Management_Group,_2014_CITE), which allows for the specification of constraints based on first-order predicate logic"
A rule based approach to identify structural inconsistencies during evolution of aPS is presented in Strube_et al._(2011_CITE).
"Here, approaches can be used, for example, to compare whether two finite automata are consistent by identifying whether one simulates the other or both simulate each other (bisimulation) ( Clarke_et al.,_1999_CITE)"
"More complex relations (called refinement notions) between automata exist, which can be used to define and check various degrees of consistency ( Baier_and_Katoen,_2008;_Heinzemann_and_Henkler,_2011;_Jensen_et al.,_2000;_Weise_and_Lenzkes,_1997_CITE)."
"With respect to the repair of inconsistencies, approaches have been proposed to use OCL constraints and the part of the constraint, which has not been satisfied, to create an appropriate repair action ( Nentwich_et al.,_2003_CITE)"
"In the area of model transformations, Bidirectional Model Transformations like JTL ( Cicchetti_et al.,_2010_CITE) and Triple Graph Grammars (TGG) ( Hermann_et al.,_2014;_Hildebrandt_et al.,_2013;_Sch rr,_1995_CITE) have been developed to transform between models"
"Transformation languages that support incremental change propagation ( Giese_and_Wagner,_2009_CITE) are particularly interesting as they enable to only propagate single changes from the source, ie, they change only those parts of the target model which are affected by the change in the source"
"Most approaches addressing safety employ this kind of additional annotations ( Giese_and_Tichy,_2006;_Grunske_et al.,_2005;_Papadopoulos_et al.,_2001_CITE)"
Tribastone_and_Gilmore_(2008)_CITE and Becker_et al._(2009)_CITE propose similar approaches addressing performance.
"The approaches of Filieri_et al._(2012),_Go eva-Popstojanova_and_Trivedi_(2001),_Zheng_et al._(2008)_CITE, and Filieri_et al._(2015)_CITE address this problem by inferring the characteristics at runtime from the running system in order to increase the accuracy of the quality predictions"
"For example, Filieri_et al._(2015)_CITE combine a Kalman Filter with self-adaptive behavior in order to both reduce noise and increase the speed of responding to changes in the behavior of the system."
"With respect to incremental analysis approaches for non-functional properties, Kwiatkowska_et al._(2011)_CITE present an incremental technique for quantitative verification of Markov decision processes, which is able to reuse results from previous verification runs and exploiting a decomposition of the model"
"Similarly, Song_et al._(2013)_CITE propose a compositional approach for the probability reachability analysis of Discrete Time Markov Chains that decomposes the system into strongly connected components or even parts of them, analyze them using Gauss Jordan Elimination ( Althoen_and_McLaughlin,_1987_CITE), and afterwards use value iteration to compute the result for the complete model based on the individually analyzed parts"
"One specific type of architectural technical debt ( Martini_et al.,_2014_CITE) is non-compliance between architectural guidelines and the system architecture"
"Architectural guidelines, patterns and styles have been presented in Buschmann_et al._(1996)_CITE"
"A specific architectural pattern for embedded systems is the Operator Controller Module (OCM) ( Burmester_et al.,_2008_CITE), which defines concrete layers and interfaces between them for different parts of the embedded software feedback controllers, hard real-time communication and reconfiguration of the feedback controllers, and a soft real-time layer."
Herold_et al._(2013)_CITE present an approach to automatically check the conformance of the architecture against guidelines and architectural styles
A complementary approach has been proposed in Herold_and_Mair_(2014)_CITE which uses a meta-heuristic to efficiently search for violations of architectural compliance rules and to propose a sequence of repair actions to remove the identified violations automatically.
First steps towards addressing technical debt generally in aPS have been recently proposed by Vogel-Heuser_et al._(2015)_CITE
"According to ARC_(2011_CITE), in most manufacturing systems the use of IEC 61131-3 ( IEC,_2009_CITE ,_2013_CITE) compliant runtime environments currently is and will be the state of industrial practice in the next 5 10 years"
"Despite efforts toward including object-oriented programming aspects within IEC 61131-3 ( IEC,_2013_CITE), the standard in its current version has not yet been fully established in the industry"
"Thus, we focus on IEC 61131-3 without object-oriented extension ( IEC,_2009_CITE), which is mostly used within state of the art industrial applications ( Thramboulidis_and_Frey,_2011_CITE)."
"Modularity is still rarely fully applied in aPS software: Reusable artefacts are mostly fine-grained and have to be modified on different positions, so that errors are probable and important reuse potential is wasted ( Maga_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Reuse is mostly achieved through copy, paste and modification actions ( Katzke_et al.,_2004_CITE)"
"Feldmann_et al._(2012)_CITE identified as reasons for this situation: the multitude of disciplines involved (such as software engineering, automation engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, safety engineering, perhaps also chemical engineering), and the interdependencies of software modules with mechanical and electrical modules ( Jazdi_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
This may lead to inconsistencies between implementation and design artifacts as well as to unclear code structure ( Katzke_et al._2004;_Vogel-Heuser_et al._2014a_CITE).
"But also in traditional software engineering, the main technique to derive adapted or improved implementation versions of software functionality is clone and own ( Ray_and_Kim,_2012_CITE)"
"Software engineering for aPS is still struggling with modularity and the best level of software component size ( Feldmann_et al.,_2012,_2015;_Maga_et al.,_2011_CITE) and the interfaces between these components"
Katzke_et al._(2004)_CITE and Maga_et al._(2011)_CITE found different component sizes in aPS software (called granularity) and described the challenge to choose the best size and interface in between components for reuse and evolution
"For instance, Juergens_et al._(2009)_CITE have shown that code clones are more prone to introduce errors"
"Moreover, Harder_and_Tiarks_(2012)_CITE have shown, that error-correcting tasks tend to be incorrect in the presence of clones"
"Most importantly, Kapser_et al._(2008)_CITE provide a methodology of how cloning is used as a reuse techniques such as, by using templating or forking to evolve software systems"
"However, managing the evolution of cloned code itself may be challenging, especially the fact that developers must be aware of changes that possibly have to be propagated, which is usually a tedious and time-consuming task ( Bettenburg_et al.,_2009;_Ray_and_Kim,_2012_CITE)"
"Beyond code clones, a broader notion of code smells has been introduced ( Fowler,_1999_CITE) and extended by the notion of anti-patterns ( Brown_et al.,_1998_CITE)"
"Particularly, Abbes_et al._(2011)_CITE have shown that the presence of two anti-patterns impedes the performance of developers"
"Similarly, Sjoberg_et al._(2013)_CITE conducted a large-scale study and concluded that code smells are good indicators for assessing maintainability on file level"
"While other studies show that perception of code smells may differ between developers ( Yamashita_et al.,_2012_CITE), it is generally admitted that code smells hinder evolution because they impede extending and maintaining the underlying system."
"Design patterns such as those proposed by Gamma_et al._(1994)_CITE, are means in classical software engineering to support code modularity and evolution"
"Amaptzoglou_et al._(2011)_CITE reveal that using design patterns increases reusability, and thus, supports the evolution of software systems"
"However, other studies also indicate that design pattern may also impede evolution and maintenance and have to be applied properly ( Khomh_et al.,_2008,_2009_CITE)."
"Efforts towards evaluating different methods of implementing logic control algorithms within IEC 61131-3 were conducted ( Hajarnavis_and_Young,_2008_CITE), but specific patterns have not been derived yet"
"However, design patterns within control engineering would address a multitude of issues such as controller design, architectural design as well as implementation aspects ( Sanz_and_Zalewski,_2003_CITE)"
"Patterns have been especially investigated within the emerging model-based design of automation software, eg, using UML ( Fantuzzi_et al.,_2009_CITE)"
"The authors introduced design patterns for solving typical problems such as hierarchical control, alarm handling and motion control using state charts as well as guidelines for implementing these patterns in IEC 61131-3 programming languages ( Bonf _et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"In Preschern_et al._(2012)_CITE, patterns for improving system flexibility and maintainability are introduced"
"In Fay_et al._(2015)_CITE, an approach is presented which integrates the use of function-oriented design patterns into the engineering workflow of aPS to assist the designer regarding the fulfillment of NFRs"
"It could be shown that the application of these design patterns has a positive impact on the correct design of the software functions and on the appropriate deployment to automation hardware ( Fay_et al.,_2015_CITE)."
Fuchs_et al._(2014)_CITE conducted a detailed analysis of IEC 61131-3 code from machine manufacturing industry and introduced an analysis and visualization approach
Feldmann_et al._(2012)_CITE and Fuchs_et al._(2012)_CITE analyzed and refactored the software structure on IEC code level in an industrial case study in a world market leading plant manufacturing company
"For IEC 61499-based applications ( IEC,_2011_CITE), common solutions and guidelines were proposed for hierarchical automation solutions ( Zoitl_and_Pr hofer,_2013_CITE), failure management ( Serna_et al.,_2010_CITE) and portable automation projects ( Dubinin_and_Vyatkin,_2012_CITE)"
"Even software design patterns for IEC 61499 programs, eg, Distributed Application, Proxy and Model-View-Controller, were defined ( Christensen,_2000_CITE) and evaluated ( Str mman_et al.,_2005_CITE)"
"However, although IEC 61499 runtimes on state of the art controllers exist ( Vyatkin,_2011_CITE), IEC 61499 has a long way in order to be seriously considered by the industry ( Thramboulidis,_2013_CITE)."
"The most popular means is refactoring, which provides systematic techniques for restructuring the internal system (ie, the source code) while the external visible behavior is preserved ( Fowler,_1999_CITE)"
"As such, refactoring has been established and numerous studies have demonstrated its usefulness ( Fanta_and_Raijlich,_1999;_Kegel_and_Steinmann,_2008_CITE)"
A hierarchical function block often represents a module and used as the basis for reuse in industrial practice ( Vogel-Heuser_et al._2014b;_Wenger_and_Zoitl_2012_CITE)
"Such on-site code changes may lead to inconsistencies between the implementation and the library as well as other design artifacts ( Vogel-Heuser_and_R sch,_2015_CITE), discussed using the PPU case study and the replacement of a binary sensor by an analogue one to increase the accuracy of pushing the work pieces into the slides and detecting the potential faults."
"The interdisciplinary dependencies as well as the complexity of aPS lead to the risk of unpredictable side effects of evolution in the resulting system ( Jaeger_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"A detection of these side effects becomes necessary and should be carried out automatically to avoid much effort, as explained in Braun_et al._(2012)_CITE"
"Management of aPS evolution has to deal with diverging evolution cycles of the involved disciplines ( Li_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"Because of the high complexity of the automation software and the plant itself, it is usually not obvious how the evolution in one part of the system affects other parts or the whole process ( Jaeger_et al.,_2011_CITE)"
"Instead of analyzing the state space of a model within a certain time frame, formal techniques aim at analyzing models exhaustively with respect to all reachable states ( B rard_et al.,_2001;_Clarke_et al.,_1999_CITE)"
"For example, Lahtinen_et al._(2012)_CITE state that in the nuclear engineering domain, automatic verification is beneficial compared to simulation because it can besides exploring all reachable states be applied earlier in the design phase."
"In Hussain_and_Frey_(2006)_CITE, the extraction of test sequences from state charts using round-trip path coverage is shown"
Hametner_et al._(2011)_CITE show a first implementation of the recommended test case generation process using state chart diagrams especially for IEC 61499 applications
Hametner_et al._(2010)_CITE also mention the timing diagram of the UML as a useful diagram for test case generation but no implementation is shown in their work
"R sch_et al._(2014)_CITE realize this test case generation, but focus especially on testing machine's reaction to faults by using fault injection"
Krause_et al._(2008)_CITE introduce an approach to automatically generate test cases from UML state charts by first transforming them into a formal model (extended safe place/transition nets)
"In Kumar_et al._(2011)_CITE, UML test case generation approaches from state charts are combined with the aim of making them executable by mapping them to the Testing and Control Notation (TTCN-3)"
"In Kormann_et al._(2012)_CITE, the semantics of sequence diagrams are adapted in order to make direct IEC 61131-3 code generation possible"
"In recent years, SysML is increasingly established for supporting the development process of real-time systems by Detommasi_et al._(2013)_CITE"
"In order to integrate the requirements and test specification, a template for test cases has been developed by Feldmann_et al._(2014b)_CITE"
"The expected outputs (attribute Expected Goal ) may either be specified manually or generated automatically if the requirements have been sufficiently formalized ( Feldmann_et al.,_2014b_CITE)."
Ulewicz_et al._(2014)_CITE present a first approach for selecting and reusing existing test cases based on changes within the control program for efficient testing of changes
Lochau_et al._(2014)_CITE propose model-based testing for variant-rich aPS
"Static code analysis is successfully applied for several programming languages and environments, eg Lint for C ( Johnson,_1988_CITE) and FindBugs for Java ( Ayewah_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"However, static code analysis for IEC 61131-3 is not yet supported sufficiently ( Angerer_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"Nevertheless, in Fuchs_et al._(2014_CITE) and Pr hofer_et al._(2012_CITE) the benefits of static code analysis for IEC 61131-3 software quality improvement are highlighted and an approach for improving compliance to programming conventions and guidelines is proposed, eg by identifying incorrect naming conventions, deviating program element complexity or detecting bad code fragments"
"Model Checkers for embedded software for hybrid systems are investigated for nearly two decades now, debuted in 1997 ( Henziger_et al.,_1997_CITE)"
"Ortmeier_et al._(2004)_CITE investigated verification of embedded software focusing on safety aspects, but did not take automation and PLC software into account"
"The aforementioned MechatronicUML method ( Becker_et al._2012;_Heinzemann_et al.,_2013_CITE) supports links between engineering disciplines"
"It supports a compositional approach for the verification of discrete real-time behavior ( Giese_et al.,_2003_CITE) to improve scalability"
"The compositional approach supports multiple refinement notions to guarantee different types of system behavior ( Heinzemann_and_Henkler,_2011_CITE)"
"Finally, the MechatronicUML provides specifically support for systems which self-adapt their behavior at runtime by modeling adaptations by architectural reconfiguration based on graph transformations ( Eckardt_et al.,_2013;_Tichy_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"Verification of the adaptation behavior is based on graph transformation verification approaches ( Becker_et al.,_2006;_Ghamaraian_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"S nder_et al._(2013)_CITE propose an approach on verifying PLC programs by means of model checking, taking predefined modifications of the software into account"
"Verification of PLC programs written mainly in the programming languages Sequential Function Charts ( Bauer_et al.,_2004_CITE) and Instruction List ( Huuck,_2005_CITE) was investigated by means of the model checker UPAAL, but lack in analyzing industrial PLC programs due to size and structure"
"Arcade supporting model checking to of PLC programs written for the programming languages ST, IL as well as vendor-specific programming language and their combinations as often applied in IEC 61131 environments is presented in Biallas_et al._(2012)_CITE"
Gourcuff_et al._(2008)_CITE presented an approach for verifying cyclically executed PLC software
"Recently, Legat_et al._(2014)_CITE and Hackenberg_et al._(2014)_CITE applied model checking to also consider the interplay between PLC programs and electrical as well as mechanical aspects in order to verify conformance to requirements resp"
Witsch_and_Vogel-Heuser_(2011)_CITE proposed an approach to implement PLC software based on UML state charts (so called PLC state charts) and described its behavioral semantics and application for model checking
Mertke_and_Frey_(2001)_CITE proposed an approach on formal verification based on Petri nets by using the SPIN model checker
Greifeneder_and_Frey_(2007)_CITE proposed the modeling language called DesLaNAS which can be applied in combination with a probabilistic model checking but an automatic translation of the description model into the form needed for model checking is not available
Machado_et al._(2006)_CITE investigated the impact of applying a model of the physical plant additionally to the formal specification of controller behavior
An integrated approach to verify conformance of aPS designs is presented in Vyatkin_et al._(2009)_CITE
"For example, in Witsch_et al._(2006)_CITE an approach to verify the timing behavior of standard Ethernet networks was evaluated by means of a simple application example."
"Runtime monitoring allows for establishing the linkage between evolving plant behavior and formally specified requirements, in particular for legacy aPS for which no formal requirements for the evolved plant exist ( Haubeck_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"The inherent variability in such systems results in a huge number of possible variants which may be described by a product family, eg, a software product line (SPL) ( Clements_and_Northrop,_2001;_Pohl_et al.,_2005_CITE)"
"Variability management comprises (1) variability models in the problem space to define the configuration space which may be of different granularity for the overall product system, the mechanical, electrical/electronic and software parts, (2) variability models in the solution space to define variable and reusable engineering artifacts which span mechanical, electrical and software parts, and (3) the configuration knowledge to guarantee that a valid variant of the aPS in all its disciplines is obtained ( Czarnecki_and_Eisenecker,_2000_CITE)."
"This also affects software counterparts ( Li_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"Additionally, there can be different variants of the same aPS at the same point in time ( Braun_et al.,_2012_CITE), eg to satisfy varying customer needs"
"This diversity creates high complexity for system management and maintenance ( Brooks,_1995_CITE)"
"Feldmann_et al._(2012)_CITE analyzed the approaches and challenges for modularity, variant and version management in aPS"
Feldmann_et al._(2012)_CITE showed that module structures in different disciplines differ
"Variability modeling in the problem space defines the commonality and variability of a product family in order to specify the valid configuration space ie, specifying the set of valid software variants ( Czarnecki_and_Eisenecker,_2000_CITE)"
"Various approaches for variability modeling in the problem space exist, for instance, feature models ( Kang_et al.,_1990_CITE), orthogonal variability models ( Pohl_et al.,_2005_CITE) and decision-models"
"We describe those approaches in the following and refer to the literature ( Chen_et al.,_2009;_Schmid_et al.,_2011;_Sinnema_and_Deelstra,_2007_CITE) for further information."
"In the context of feature-oriented domain analysis, Kang_et al._(1990)_CITE introduce feature models for capturing the commonality and variability of variant-rich systems by means of features and their interrelations"
An example of the use of feature models in the design of aPS is given in Feldmann_et al._(2015_CITE) and Schr ck_et al._(2015)_CITE.
"In Fig_11 ( Lochau_et al.,_2014_CITE), the graphical representation of a feature model for the overall system of the PPU at a high level of granularity and in Fig_12 (left) a more detailed view for the crane are shown"
Feldmann_et al._(2015)_CITE showed the mapping of the customer feature models to the developer feature model with a mapping matrix
"Besides scalability for real world applications needs to be further evaluated ( Feldmann_et al.,_2015_CITE)."
Pohl_et al._(2005)_CITE proposed the orthogonal variability model also for capturing the commonality and variability of variant-rich software systems in a graphical way by means of variation points
"Another variability modeling approach is decision modeling introduced by the Synthesis project ( Synthesis,_1993_CITE)"
"It has been applied to the modeling of steel manufacturing systems ( Dhungana_et al.,_2014_CITE), considering multidisciplinary artifacts."
"Variability modeling approaches in the solution space of software-based SPLs can be separated into three different classes: annotative, compositional and transformational ( Schaefer_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"Variant annotations, eg, using stereotypes in UML models ( Gomaa,_2006_CITE) or presence conditions ( Czarnecki_and_Antkiewicz,_2005_CITE), define which parts of the model have to be removed to derive a concrete product variant"
"In Noda_and_Kishi_(2008)_CITE, models are constructed by aspect-oriented composition"
"Other approaches to represent variability on a modeling level, eg in Klein_et al._(1997_CITE) and Prehofer_(2004)_CITE, have focused more on composing and adding features and not on capturing evolution"
"Model transformations are, for instance, applied in the common variability language ( Haugen_et al.,_2008_CITE) where the variability of a base model is described by rules how modeling elements of the base model have to be substituted in order to obtain a particular product model"
"Delta modeling is a modular transformational approach to design and implement software product lines (eg, see Schaefer,_2010_CITE)"
"Delta modeling has so far been applied to represent variability of software architectures ( Haber_et al.,_2011_CITE), Java programs ( Schaefer,_2010_CITE) and a multi-perspective modeling approach for manufacturing systems ( Kowal_et al.,_2014_CITE)"
Elsner_et al._(2010)_CITE consider evolving software product lines and focus on variability in time
"A second survey article focuses on research on diversity in software and how it affects all development phases from modeling over design and implementation to quality assurance, including software evolution ( Schaefer_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
Th m_et al._(2009)_CITE present an algorithm computing the differences between two feature models after changes to a feature model
"Tool support is fully available and is already tested with an Eclipse as a large product line example ( Pleuss_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"Similar to the previous approach, Seidl_et al._(2014)_CITE describe how to extend the standard feature models to capture evolution over time"
"Schubanz_et al._(2013)_CITE developed their own specific modeling approach, which is integrated in a prototypical tool chain and focuses on a high level of abstraction, ie, evolution of development goals and requirements"
The approach by Dhungana_et al._(2010)_CITE uses model fragments for capturing the solution space variability following the principle that smaller models are better to understand
"Therefore, the multi-perspective modeling approach in Kowal_et al._(2014)_CITE is also applicable for evolution (cp"
"It is also possible to mine commonalities and differences in models for the creation of a family model, which is a so called 150% model ( Schaefer_et al.,_2012_CITE) containing the complete variability of the system"
"Wille_et al._(2013)_CITE apply this idea to block-based diagrams, eg, as available in Matlab/Simulink"
Holthusen_et al._(2014)_CITE apply it in a prototypical manner to the IEC 61131-3- language FBD
"While model-driven engineering shows an increase in effectiveness and quality and is used in the embedded software industry ( Liebel_et al.,_2014_CITE) by exploiting domain knowledge, it also introduces general challenges and challenges specific to aPS."
"This process is called Forward Engineering ( Sendall_and_K ster,_2004_CITE)"
"This cycle of generating code from models and propagating changes on the source code back to the models is known as round-trip engineering ( Hettel_et al.,_2008_CITE) in contrast to the one-way forward engineering of source code from models and the one-way reverse engineering from models from source code"
"This challenge is related to the specific situation in aPS in which changes on the automation system have to be done on-site by technicians or even skilled workers ( Vogel-Heuser,_2009_CITE) to perform generally small-scale adaptations, eg, adapt the behavior of the automation system due to replaced hardware or slightly different characteristics of hardware or workpieces or material, environmental characteristics etc"
"Finally, three recent surveys of practice in model-driven approaches for embedded systems and usability of model-driven engineering notations in embedded systems and, specifically, aPS ( Hutchinson_et al.,_2011;_Liebel_et al.,_2014;_Vogel-Heuser,_2014e_CITE) show that tool integration and tool usability as well as high effort to reap benefits are big challenges in employing model-driven engineering in industry"
As Vogel-Heuser_et al._(2012)_CITE showed usability of MDE approaches is strongly related to students' basic skills and appropriate fade out training approach
"Sim_and_Vogel-Heuser_(2010)_CITE proved the benefit of active learning comparing mechatronic engineering students with students of computer science, but still an appropriate education for MDE with a focus on aPS is missing."
"An approach for model-driven engineering that sufficiently supports the development and implementation of software in aPS needs to provide an automatic generation of executable software, as, eg, presented by Bonf _et al._(2013_CITE), Est vez_et al._(2007_CITE), Witsch_and_Vogel-Heuser_(2011_CITE) and Yang_and_Vyatkin_(2012_CITE)"
"Furthermore, in Vepsalainen_et al._(2010_CITE), it was identified that the modeling of user-defined control logic is required in addition to the application of predefined control blocks"
"For acceptance of novel concepts, those have to be easily applicable and reproducible for other researchers ( Goldberg,_2012_CITE)"
"Furthermore, integration with related concepts such as model-based test case generation and execution ( Kormann_et al.,_2012_CITE) is simplified."
"Obermeier_et al._(2014)_CITE introduce a domain specific UML for aPS (modAT4rMS based on plcML) supporting the quality of structural modeling for the creation of new models, the reuse as well as the evolution (building new variants)"
Duschl_et al._(2014)_CITE attempt to reveal the reasons behind the errors especially in module creation in the above mentioned study conducting interviews after the experiments
"As a basis to describe different aspects of aPS at different hierarchical levels, adaptations of UML and SysML are proposed in Bassi_et al._(2011_CITE), Bonf _et al._(2005_CITE) and Secchi_et al._(2007_CITE)"
"Concepts for supplying object-oriented models with a formal basis, eg, in order to apply methods for verifying modeled system requirements ( S nder_et al.,_2013_CITE), have been proposed by Secchi_et al._(2007)_CITE"
"The modeling approaches used in these and other works ( Bassi_et al.,_2011;_Bonf _et al.,_2013_CITE) enable an integration of software models and physical models into a single consistent syntax"
"To generate detailed automation software, design patterns and transformation rules are proposed in Bonf _et al._(2013_CITE)"
"The integration of MDE, ie plcML being a UML dialect, into a PLC programming environment is realized by Witsch_and_Vogel-Heuser (2011)_CITE and available for state chart and class diagrams in CODESYS V3 9 9HYPERLINK, retrieved 8/21/2015."
"Sequence diagrams ( Kormann_et al.,_2012_CITE) and activity diagrams ( Bayrak_et al.,_2011_CITE) have been adapted and integrated too, but are not available on the market yet"
platform has been introduced in Tikhonov_et al._(2014)_CITE
"For hybrid models combining closed loop control and interlocking, Bayrak_et al._(2012)_CITE and Schneider_et al._(2014)_CITE developed the model transformation from MATLAB/Simulink to CFC for different PLC programming environments."
"Aside from works addressing IEC 61131-3 implementations, event-driven implementations conforming to the IEC 61499 standard ( Bianchi_et al.,_2003;_Chhabra_and_Emami,_2011;_Hirsch,_2010;_Hirsch_et al.,_2008;_Vyatkin_et al.,_2009_CITE) were proposed"
A systems engineering framework based on SysML and IEC 61499 is considered in Hirsch_(2010_CITE) and Hirsch_et al._(2008)_CITE
"An approach to generate IEC 61499 compliant software from UML-based models is presented in ( Dubinin_et al.,_2005_CITE)"
"In Vyatkin_et al._(2009_CITE) and Yang_and_Vyatkin_(2012_CITE), a concept for model transformations between IEC 61499 and Matlab/Simulink models is proposed that supports transforming automation software to MATLAB/Simulink for verification purposes and the transformation of controllers designed using MATLAB/Simulink into executable software"
"With respect to ensuring consistency of models with manually changed generated code, the approach by Bork_et al._(2008)_CITE exploits the templates used for code generation to re-parse the generated code with manual changes"
"The challenge of round-trip engineering is supported by the close integration of UML into the IEC 61131-3 environment ( Witsch_and_Vogel-Heuser,_2011_CITE) because the model is the code"
"Another approach ( Angyal_et al.,_2008_CITE) proposes to use the Abstract Syntax Tree of the generated source code as an intermediate model, which represents the source code as a model, and uses bi-directional incremental model merges to keep the abstract syntax tree consistent with the changed code"
V lter_et al._(2006)_CITE present design patterns for the integration of generated code with manual written code to avoid the problem of manual changes in generated code
"Traceability is required in many engineering standards (eg, IEEE-Standard_830-1998_CITE)"
"ATL ( Jouault_and_Kurtev,_2006_CITE) and QVT ( Object_Management_Group,_2008_CITE) are examples of model transformation approaches, which automatically create the traces"
"Henshin ( Arendt_et al.,_2010_CITE) allows transformation developers to manually add trace links, whereas the Triple Graph Grammar approach of Hermann_et al._(2014)_CITE, which is based on Henshin, automatically creates trace links."
"Trace links can also be created using information-retrieval techniques ( Cleland-Huang_et al.,_2007_CITE)"
"The authors give an overview on two techniques for automatic generation of trace link candidates from requirements and other system artifacts based on probabilistic network models ( Antoniol_et al.,_2002_CITE) and vector space models ( Cleland-Huang_et al.,_2005_CITE)"
"Berkovich_et al._(2011)_CITE investigate tracing on interdisciplinary Product-Service Systems (PSS), eg mechatronic products including services"
"Wolfenstetter_et al._(2015)_CITE analyzed and evaluated different traceability techniques from a requirements engineering perspective regarding ten criteria, eg, variability and configuration management, version management, simultaneous development of different views, with the result provides sufficient support."
"According to the project dependent and project independent activities presented in the adapted ( VDI/VDE_3695, 2010)_CITE life-cycle model, six evolution scenarios for automated production systems were introduced and linked to the evolution scenarios of a simple pick and place unit as application example highlighting evolution steps in different disciplines and their processing"
The effectiveness of preview control in wind turbine control has also been demonstrated [28 30]_CITE.
"In [31 33]_CITE, multi-model adaptive control using multiple models to identify the unknown plant is considered; as higher level adaptive control, this improves the transient response of control systems with large uncertainties in a stable fashion"
"The authors in [31]_CITE designed a piecewise linear time-invariant switching control law, which leads to a guarantee of Lyapunov stability with an exponential rate of convergence for the state"
"Based on the method, a kind of switching controller for discrete time system was proposed [32]_CITE"
"In [33]_CITE, a localization-based method was introduced, which is manifested as the rapid convergence of the switching controller"
[34]_CITE promoted the results and discussed the problem of optimal localization
Other several methods of adaptive control based on multiple models were examined in [35]_CITE.
"By defining monitoring function and switching principle similarly to [31]_CITE, the problem is formally converted into a normal optimal control problem that includes preview information"
"[2]_CITE Meanwhile, the exponential factor e 2 k makes the closed-loop system have exponential asymptotic stability"
"By constructing the augmented error system (with previewable information), tracking problem can be transformed into a regulation problem [4]_CITE"
"In addition, from condition A3 and [10]_CITE, we know that (A ,B ) is stabilizable and (Q 1/2,A ) is detectable."
"According to Lemma 2, for any fixed *=(A *,B *) , we know that there exists a preview controller u *(k)=F *X (k) minimizing the performance index (6), such that the eigenvalues of closed-loop system matrices M(F *)=A *+B *F * satisfy max| (A *+B *F *)| From the continuity of the eigenvalues of M(F *)with respect to the system matrices, [31]_CITE we have the continuity of max| (A *+B *F *)| with respect to M(F *)"
"From Lemma 2, we know that there exist a finite number of compact sets i*,i (1,2, ,h), and associated gain matrices Fi, i (1, 2, , h), such that max| (M(Fi))| Therefore, from [31]_CITE, we can get a finite number of Lyapunov matrices Pi( Pi > 0), i (1, 2, , h) such that for each i*,i (1,2, ,h), the following inequalities hold: (1 M(Fi))TPi(1 M(Fi)) Pi I,i (1,2, ,h)"
"From the continuity of the eigenvalues of M(F *)with respect to the system matrices, [31]_CITE we have the continuity of max| (A *+B *F *)| with respect to M(F *)"
"Therefore, from [31]_CITE, we can get a finite number of Lyapunov matrices Pi( Pi > 0), i (1, 2, , h) such that for each i*,i (1,2, ,h), the following inequalities hold: (1 M(Fi))TPi(1 M(Fi)) Pi I,i (1,2, ,h)."
"This process is called evidence propagation [6,14]_CITE"
"There are widely available BN tools that implement standard propagation algorithms (see [12]_CITE for extensive list and comparisons), and hence enable non-specialist users to easily build and run BN models"
"Although previous work has touched on the problem (Diez and Druzdzel [5,8,9,11,14 16]_CITE) it has never been stated explicitly nor has it been adequately resolved, although the problem of transforming the states of a variable into multiple mutually exclusive variables appears to bear a close resemblance to the problem of transforming an n-ary constraint into multiple binary ones in the field of constraint satisfaction [17]_CITE"
Jensen and Nielsen [9]_CITE proposed a solution by introducing a Boolean constraint node (as shown in Fig_4 for the simplest case where n = 2) and setting it to be true
It is important to note that in the examples in [9]_CITE the priors for the mutually exclusive nodes were assumed to be uniform (ie in the 2-node example the prior true and false probabilities were 0.5 for each Ci node).
Diez and Druzdzel [5]_CITE also introduced an XOR constraint node and proposed a method that also satisfies Property 2
The constraint on the auxiliary node can also be imposed by using virtual evidence [2 4]_CITE directly on the auxiliary
Our original motivation for solving the problem was driven by its frequent occurrence in handling legal arguments where the prosecution and defence hypotheses normally have clearly different causal explanations and evidence [7]_CITE
Fig_7 shows an example fragment of a model from [7]_CITE in which two nodes need to be separate (because of different causal pathways) but also have to be mutually exclusive
Our proposed solution has also already been adopted by Vlek et al [18]_CITE to analyse evidence in legal trials using narratives
Vlek et al [18]_CITE used mutually exclusive causes to combine multiple BN fragments about different narratives in a real legal case study
"BNs have two types of uncertain evidence virtual and soft evidence that are often confused with each other [2,4,14]_CITE"
Fig_14 shows how the constraint is imposed with virtual evidence in AgenaRisk [1]_CITE using the same example shown in Section 4
Soft evidence is not readily implemented in the popular BN tools; the likelihood ratios that satisfy the desired soft evidence must be manually calculated and entered by users [12]_CITE
"There are propagation algorithms for soft evidence (for example big clique [10]_CITE, IPFP [13]_CITE but none are provided with any of the widely available BN tools"
[14]_CITE considered that the only sensible type of uncertain evidence that could rationally be specified was virtual evidence
"The distinction and comparison between the different types of uncertain evidence is explained in detail by [2,4,14]_CITE."
14 shows how the constraint is imposed with virtual evidence in AgenaRisk [1]_CITE using the same example shown in Section 4.
The fundamental aim of reduced order modelling is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom (DoF) necessary to produce the required information to an acceptable level of accuracy [4]_CITE
The vast majority of reduced order models (ROMs) achieve this result by projecting the governing equations onto a series of spatial modes [5]_CITE
"In equation driven methods, such as nonlinear normal modes [6]_CITE, the modes are constructed by applying mathematical reduction techniques directly to the equations themselves"
"Data driven methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), use sample stored calculated solutions or experimental data to generate the spatial modes [1]_CITE"
POD methods have been widely employed for the analysis of problems involving fluid flow [7 9]_CITE
"The objective is to identify an optimal coordinate system to represent an ensemble of snapshots, ie, a sample of solution fields, by removing redundant information [10]_CITE"
"In practice, this amounts to finding the smallest possible set of basis functions which can be employed to reconstruct each snapshot of the ensemble [3,11]_CITE"
"The set of basis functions forms a series of POD modes, each carrying a percentage of the flow energy [7]_CITE"
"An important issue is that the basis, and hence the model, will only contain information that is present in the ensemble of snapshots [10]_CITE"
"Using these snapshots, the POD modes are obtained by performing a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the matrix whose columns are the snapshots [1,7]_CITE"
Reliable algorithms have been developed to compute the SVD and these can be readily applied to POD applications [12]_CITE.
Galerkin projection is the most frequently used method for obtaining a reduced order model from a POD for unsteady problems [3]_CITE
"Essentially, the exact time dependent governing equations are directly projected onto the POD basis using an inner product [2]_CITE"
"Stability problems have been encountered when solving for the time dependent coefficients in this manner [4,3,16,17]_CITE"
"Further to this the snapshots may contain large concentrations of errors due to discontinuities in the geometry (eg at corners) which would be reproduced in the ROM, and the full order CFD model might contain nonphysical stabilisation terms which would need to be accounted for in the ROM [2]_CITE"
The approach introduced by My Ha et al [18]_CITE for steady parameterised fluid problems does not require the evaluation of integrals
"To overcome the issue of interpolation cost, we employ radial basis function (RBF) interpolation [21]_CITE, where the interpolation expense does not increase significantly with the number of dimensions"
"RBF interpolation can be readily implemented, as it does not require a triangulation to define the connectivity between the data points [22]_CITE"
"It has been applied to many fields, including the solution of partial differential equations [23]_CITE"
"At each time step, the implicit equation system is solved by explicit iteration, with multigrid acceleration [24,25]_CITE"
"For regions with discontinuities a first-order harmonic term is added, where a pressure switch is used to ensure the term is only significant in regions of strong pressure gradients [26]_CITE"
"This was accomplished using the Delaunay graph concept [28]_CITE, resulting in the same nodal connectivities on each mesh"
This was accomplished using the MATLAB [29]_CITE function interp1
For example Lieu et al [15]_CITE applied Galerkin projection to a complete F-16 aircraft model which depended only on the angle of attack and free-stream Mach number M
Lieu et al [15]_CITE approached the problem by first performing a subspace angle interpolation of the POD modes then projecting these on the governing equations
"This family of techniques is discussed elsewhere [30,31]_CITE where it is stated that the applicability of POD interpolation techniques to unsteady problems is unclear"
"To see this, consider the simple case of two snapshots in a one dimensional parameter space at coordinates 1 and 2 where (10)Tl( 1)= i=1MQil( 1) iland (11)Tl( 2)= i=1MQil( 2) ilUsing linear interpolation Qil( ) can be obtained for any [31]_CITE (12)Qil( )=Qil( 1)+Qil( 1)-Qil( 2) 1- 2( - 1)for i=1 2"
"The same finding was discussed by Bouhoubeiny and Druault [32]_CITE, who applied a similar technique to interpolate experimental data in time"
It is known that the accuracy of the RBF approximation depends upon the value that is adopted for the parameter c [22]_CITE
"Rippa [23]_CITE introduced an algorithm to find the optimum value for a particular data set but, for all the cases considered here, the additional expense incurred in performing an analysis of this type did not prove to be justified"
Franke [33]_CITE states that extending triangulation and derivative based techniques to problems with more than two dimensions can be extremely difficult and in some cases impossible
The primary disadvantage to RBF interpolation is as the number of data points exceeds 100 the cost of calculating the weights becomes significant [33]_CITE
"It is difficult to find comparisons of this nature, however in an early POD/ROM paper Pettit and Beran [34]_CITE speculate that using a ROM should be better than interpolation, but stated that this needed to be tested"
Degroote et al [30]_CITE provide a comparison between Kriging interpolation of the solution field and ROMs projected onto basis functions interpolated with respect to the parameter space
Results were also recently reported by Wang et al [31]_CITE who compared POD interpolation techniques to POD projection techniques
"When considering the stability problems [17,34,35]_CITE and boundary condition violations [17]_CITE reported when applying POD projection methods to simple two dimensional flow problems, our findings suggest interpolation may be an attractive alternative"
"In applications, such as electromagnetic scattering [36]_CITE, where a small variation in parameters can result a sudden change in the unknowns, the sampling resolution required to capture parametric variation may be so high to make direct interpolation fruitless"
Fewer values requiring interpolation also means it becomes feasible to inspect the smoothness of these values with respect to parameter variation and to apply adaptive interpolation schemes [37]_CITE
"to the overlay services ( Carpenter_and_Brim,_2002_CITE)"
"However, to deploy and manage traditional middleboxes requires costly capital and operational expenditures ( Sherry_et al.,_2012_CITE)"
"running in commodity, off-the-shelf servers ( European_Telecommunications_Standards_Institute,_2012_CITE)."
"Today, modern services require combinations of NFs, known as service chains, to satisfy their QoS requirements ( Quinn_and_Nadeau,_2015_CITE)"
"For instance, Amazon offers services that allow tenants to build their own virtual infrastructure by combining functions such as filtering, routing, slicing, and load balancing ( Amazon,_2016_CITE)"
"In such an environment, even state of the art frameworks such as ClickOS ( Martins_et al.,_2014_CITE) and NetVM ( Hwang_et al.,_2014_CITE) cannot achieve high-performance, as there is a substantial throughput degradation when interconnecting multiple NFs"
"Recent efforts, such as E2 ( Palkar_et al.,_2015_CITE) and OpenNetVM ( Zhang_et al.,_2016_CITE), overcome this problem by eliminating hypervisor and paravirtualization overheads via lightweight NFs (eg, placed in containers) interconnected with fast, custom software switches."
"Although techniques such as single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) can bypass the hypervisor and pass packets from the NICs to the virtual machines (VMs) ( Amazon,_2016_CITE), cloud applications still use costly system calls to interact with the NICs"
Part of this problem has been recently addressed by Sivaraman_et al._(2016)_CITE with their programmable packet scheduling techniques in switches and by Mittal_et al._(2016)_CITE introduction of packet scheduling algorithms that roughly meet the requirements of a universal packet scheduler
"Our implementation ( Katsikas,_2016a_CITE) builds upon the popular FastClick NFV framework."
"In the first column of Table 1, we state the comparisons we made throughout this paper among ( i) standalone NFs that use different network drivers in user or kernel-space and ( ii) chained user-space NFs, interconnected either with a kernel-based Open vSwitch (OVSK) ( Open_vSwitch,_2016_CITE) software switch or back-to-back (B2B)"
"Although there are tools ( Perf,_2016;_Levon,_2016;_KCachegrind,_2016_CITE) for interacting with a Linux OS, one has to employ vendor-specific tools to acquire (some of) the hardware events"
"As for the ability of the SCC Profiler to time the functions of the NFV stack, we exploit Intel high-precision event timers (HPET) ( Intel,_2016c_CITE) via Perf to acquire the entire list of functions together with their contribution to the total latency."
"We focus on a basic NF, a router, using a slightly modified version of the router implemented by Kohler et al in Kohler_et al._(2000)_CITE"
"To summarize the study made in Katsikas_(2016b_CITE), we quantified the performance difference between a state of the art NFV router using the DPDK network driver and the kernel-based router using the native Linux network driver"
"This is not surprising, since aggressive batching has a well-studied effect on latency and latency variance ( Kim_et al.,_2012_CITE)."
"For example, lmbench ( McVoy_and_Staelin,_1996_CITE) and Intel memory latency checker (MLC) ( Intel,_2013_CITE) quantify the latency when transferring data of variable size across different hardware components (ie, registers, caches, main memory)"
"Code Profilers: Modern code profilers, such as OProfile ( Levon,_2016_CITE) and Perf ( Perf,_2016_CITE), access low-level performance counters at run-time, providing statistics about applications or the entire OS"
"Data Profilers: Various cache profiling tools have been proposed, such as CProf ( Lebeck_and_Wood,_1994_CITE), callgrind KCachegrind tool ( KCachegrind,_2016_CITE) (based on valgrind), and Intel PMU ( Intel,_2016d_CITE)"
"DProf ( Pesterev_et al.,_2010_CITE) helps programmers understand cache miss costs by associating these misses with the data types instead of the code"
Scheduling: Sivaraman_et al._(2016)_CITE envisioned future switches with programmable boards that allow network administrators to deploy custom packet scheduling schemes
"Mittal_et al._(2016)_CITE explored the possibility of designing a universal packet scheduler that can match the results of any scheduling algorithm, concluding that the Least Slack Time First algorithm is the one that best approximates the universal scheduler."
"Network I/O: Netmap ( Rizzo,_2012_CITE), DPDK ( DPDK,_2016_CITE), PFQ ( Bonelli_et al.,_2012_CITE), and PF_RING ( Deri,_2011_CITE) are network I/O mechanisms that boost NFV performance by providing direct access to the ring buffers of a NIC, using custom network drivers"
"We found that the vectorized I/O technique ( Bhattacharya_et al.,_2003_CITE) introduced in version 2.5 of the Linux kernel permits reading/writing frames from/to multiple buffers using a single transaction"
"Our implementation is released as an open source project ( Katsikas,_2016a_CITE) on top of FastClick"
"Earlier efforts have successfully applied similar techniques ( Rizzo,_2012;_Kim_et al.,_2012;_DPDK,_2016_CITE) to amortize the system calls overhead."
"As a future work, we aim to further improve the I/O performance of SCC by integrating the asynchronous, zero-copy I/O proposed by Drepper ( Drepper,_2006_CITE) into FastClick"
"Energy policy issues have remained high on the political agenda both on national and international levels since the turn of the century, driven by the common economic factors such as growing energy demand, scarcity of resources and volatility in the price of fossil fuels, as well as growing concerns over climate change ( IEA-NEA,_2010;_IPCC,_2013_CITE)"
"Several countries around the world see nuclear power as an important route for cutting carbon emissions while meeting their energy demands in the future ( IPCC,_2014_CITE), even though the viability of the nuclear option in a sustainable energy mix is being debated constantly ( Kaygusuz,_2012;_Mari,_2014;_Mez,_2012;_Verbruggen,_2008_CITE)."
"Nuclear power is often regarded to be amongst the safest forms of electricity generation, taking into account the complete world-wide electricity production chains, with some arguing that this result holds even after the possibility of large nuclear accidents is included in the analysis ( Kearns,_Thomas,_Taylor,_&_Boyle,_2012_CITE)"
"A number of methodologies and software packages, often referred to as Decision Support Systems, have been developed to aid this ( Bartzis_et al.,_2000;_French,_1996;_Geldermann_et al.,_2009;_H m l inen,_Lindstedt,_&_Sinkko,_2000;_Hoe_&_M ller,_2003;_Landman,_P sler-Sauer,_&_Raskob,_2014_CITE; OECD/NEA,_2000_CITE; Papamichail_&_French,_2005;_Wex,_Schryen,_Feuerriegel,_&_Neumann,_2014_CITE)"
"As one recent report puts it, in order to effectively position nuclear power in the long-term energy mix, nuclear policy needs to highlight nuclear safety even more by developing advanced nuclear technologies and by upgrading nuclear safety standards continuously after Fukushima ( Fujii_&_Komiyama,_2015_CITE)."
"The literature on dynamic decision making and economic optimisation in the response and recovery phases is, however, considerably less mature ( Altay_&_Green III,_2006_CITE)."
"Immediate response to a nuclear accident involves procedures for evacuation, sheltering, iodine tablets distribution, whereas recovery measures include long-term relocation and remediation, as well as potential repopulation of the affected areas ( Gering,_Gerich,_Wirth,_&_Kirchner,_2013;_Higgins_et al.,_2008;_Munro,_2013_CITE)"
"The key difference between the response and recovery stages is, therefore, the timescale on which the relevant measures are implemented: while emergency response can take place on the timescale of minutes, hours and days in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear disaster, recovery measures often span over weeks, months and years ( DECC,_2013_CITE)"
"Short-term response, therefore, is expected to have typical features of emergency planning, when precautionary actions may not necessarily be justified in economic terms ( Dana,_2002;_Klinke_&_Renn,_2001_CITE)"
"Of the vast literature on Chernobyl, the two key studies on the long-term measures are ( Lochard_&_Schneider,_1992_CITE) (contamination and population distributions, resettlement and health costs) and ( Jacob_et al.,_2009_CITE) (remediation costs in rural areas); see also ( IAEA,_2006;_Karaoglou,_1996_CITE)"
"The existing studies on Fukushima have focused on providing contamination maps and summarizing early-stage radiological impacts on the environment ( IRSN,_2011;_2012_CITE), analysing health effects for the affected populations ( Gonz lez_et al.,_2013;_Harada_et al.,_2014;_WHO,_2013_CITE), assessing economics of decontamination ( Munro,_2013_CITE) and people intention to return to their evacuated family homes ( Munro_&_Managi,_2014_CITE)"
"The detailed input data for these packages can be obtained from economic and population databases such as GIS for many locations throughout the world ( De Silva_&_Eglese,_2000_CITE), including those near the existing nuclear installations."
"However, these sorts of optimal control problems are commonly solved in Mathematical Finance and, more generally, in Operations Research ( Sahebjamnia,_Torabi,_&_Mansouri,_2015_CITE), and we are going to follow that framework here to identify the best post-accident recovery strategies"
"It is clear that choosing the location of each nuclear installation is a balancing act between various factors, most importantly the proximity of the sites to urban areas with significant population ( Grimston,_Nuttall,_&_Vaughan,_2014_CITE)"
"It is possible that emergency evacuations and long-term relocations inside these relatively unaffected areas might have caused psychological and economic harm comparable to (or even exceeding) the potential radiological harm averted by these actions ( Ahn_et al.,_2015_CITE), as arguably was also the case in for a number of evacuations in the aftermath of Chernobyl ( IAEA,_2006;_Karaoglou,_1996;_Walinder,_1995_CITE)"
"At the same time, the emergency response in the significantly affected settlements both within and beyond the 30 kilometres zone was delayed, and according to the ( WHO,_2013_CITE) report, a substantial number of people in those areas received large doses, resulting in the Deliberate Evacuation area being installed in the relevant prefectures ( Fig_1(b))"
"A dartboard-like structure ( Gering_et al.,_2013_CITE) might be a good starting point, although a more detailed mosaic-like pattern tailored around the urban areas within the circular zones could provide a greater level of control ( Fig_2 )."
"Ultimately, the feasibility of having different treatments within specified boundaries will depend on how densely populated the entire prototype exclusion zone is, which is part of a wider issue of siting for nuclear power installations ( Grimston_et al.,_2014_CITE)."
"Considering the joint cost-minimal strategy across a number of measures is particularly important in the situations such as large accidents where a combination of individually justified actions may be deemed unacceptable as a whole due to high levels of disruption to society ( ICRP,_2009_CITE)"
"To address the need for the spatial and temporal flexibilities, we develop a decision-making model for a single economic location (say, a town, a village or an area of agricultural land) based on Bellman Optimal Control Theory ( Bellman,_1956_CITE), which is at the basis of the Operations Research (OR) methodology"
"In reality, any long-term decision making takes into account a number of non-economic factors such as acceptance of a decision by various groups including the public, decision-makers, stakeholders and experts ( Geldermann_et al.,_2009_CITE) alongside the standard radiological and economic evaluation methods"
"Based on a number of reports concerning the past nuclear accidents ( Ahn_et al.,_2015;_Dorfman,_Fucic,_&_Thomas,_2012;_IRSN,_2012;_Jacob_et al.,_2009;_Lochard_&_Schneider,_1992;_UNSCEAR,_2013_CITE) as well as the existing emergency regulations ( DECC,_2013;_Nisbet_et al.,_2009_CITE), it appears feasible to consider the following three characteristic timescales for decision making: short-term, mid-term and long-term ( Table 1 )"
"As mentioned previously, spatial flexibility in the exclusion zones could be achieved through partition into sub-regions along the prevailing wind directions (wind roses), around the main population centres, or through a dartboard-like structure ( Gering_et al.,_2013_CITE)"
"The actual radiological contamination maps in Chernobyl and Fukushima differ significantly from the simplistic structure with co-centric circles ( De Cort_et al.,_1998;_IRSN,_2012_CITE)"
"Much of the mid-term and long-term radiation exposure, both in urban and in rural areas, comes from ground shine, defined as external dose direct from radioactive materials deposited on the ground WHO_(2013)_CITE, which is a result of the initial radioactive deposition ( Harada_et al.,_2014;_Lochard_&_Schneider,_1992_CITE)"
Additional doses could be received by consuming contaminated foods and water (ingestion) and breezing radioactive particles carried by wind (inhalation) WHO_(2013)_CITE
"We restrict our analysis to ground shine and ingestion of contaminated food produce originated in rural areas, the two types of exposure most relevant on the longer timescales ( Jacob_et al.,_2009_CITE)."
"The deposition period could last several hours, days or weeks ( Ahn_et al.,_2015;_Katata_et al.,_2015_CITE), and the radioactive material will usually be carried in a plume of smoke or ash depending on the type of accident that has occurred"
"Once the deposition is over, the instantaneous effective dose rate r( t) per person at the current moment t due to external exposure from ground shine could be expressed as (1)r(t)=c NA M(t) cB(t),where NA is the Avogadro constant, is the decay rate of a given radionuclide, is its atomic weight, M( t) is its cumulative mass deposited per unit area as of time t ( Katata_et al.,_2015_CITE) and B( t) is the relevant surface radioactivity in becquerel/m 2"
"IRSN_(2011)_CITE estimate the latter at 1 Sv/h per 300 kbecquerel/m 2 per one person exposed to ground shine from equal deposits of Cs-134 and Cs-137, which is equivalent to 2.92 10 5mSv/y per 1 becquerel/m 2 per person"
"The dose conversion factors for the individual elements could vary significantly depending on their decay energy: the factor for Cs-134 is around 9 times greater than that for Cs-137 ( Yoo,_Jang,_Lee,_Noh,_&_Cho,_2013_CITE)."
"Plant uptake is the major pathway of radiocaesium from soil to human diet (see Zhu_and_Smolders,_2000_CITE, for a review of the uptake mechanisms and transfer factors (TF))"
"Denoting the radioactive transfer coefficient from soil to food as a (becquerel/kilograms in food per becquerel/m 2 on land in a single growing season, see Gillett_et al.,_2001_CITE), we express the annual flux of radiocaesium into food grown over area A as m A a B for a given soil radioactivity B in that area (becquerel/m 2)"
"According to ( Field,_2011_CITE), e=1.3 10 5millisievert/becquerel for Cs-137 among adults"
"The dose rate due to ground shine in a given area is governed by (4)drdt= ( + )r+c NA q(t),where q( t) is the deposition flux ( Katata_et al.,_2015_CITE) and is the remediation rate, which is our second control parameter; it varies between 0 (no measures) and 0 (maximum measures), and includes various clean-up techniques ( Higgins_et al.,_2008;_Jacob_et al.,_2009;_Munro,_2013_CITE)"
"Chernobyl, the biggest nuclear disaster in history, provided extensive information on the economics of a severe nuclear accident ( Jacob_et al.,_2009;_Lochard_&_Schneider,_1992_CITE)"
"The economics of nuclear decontamination and assessment of policy options for the management of land around Fukushima is described in Munro_(2013)_CITE; see also ( Munro,_2011;_2012_CITE) and the relevant WNN reports"
"The key principles for modelling the economic costs that are expected to arise off-site in the aftermath of a hypothetical nuclear accident in the UK are described in great detail in the COCO-2 report ( Higgins_et al.,_2008_CITE)."
"There is some discussion in the literature about what the true costs of exposure to radiation are, and ( Cuttler_&_Pollycove,_2009_CITE) is just one example of the relatively recent point of view that low levels of exposure to radiation can in fact provide some benefit to the recipient"
"According to ( Walinder,_1995_CITE), it is impossible to predict, by means of a mathematical expression, the specific outcome of a low radiation dose ."
"As is evident from Fukushima, even in a large-scale nuclear disaster it is unlikely that general population is going to be exposed to very high levels of radiation capable of causing the so-called deterministic health effects such as acute radiation sickness ( WHO,_2013_CITE), often triggered above a certain radiation threshold"
"These radiation levels are well below the known thresholds for the deterministic effects, and tend to cause stochastic effects on human health ( Choi,_Costes,_&_Abergel,_2015_CITE), including cancers"
"The stochastic nature of the health effects allows one to employ the commonly held (and, at the same time, much criticised) assumption of the linear-no-threshold (LNT) health response to radiation dose (see Little,_Wakeford,_Tawn,_Bouffler,_&_Berrington de_Gonzalez,_2009;_Tubiana,_Feinendegen,_Yang,_&_Kaminski,_2009_CITE, for the discussion regarding the applicability of the LNT model)."
"To estimate Fr, which is economic loss per unit dose per person regardless of whether the dose comes from ground shine, ingestion or both, we use the following expression from ( Dreicer,_Tort,_&_Manen,_1995_CITE) for the monetary gain C ( ) associated with collective averted dose D (man Sv) across all the radiological pathways under consideration: (6)C=DPf(1+wnf+wh)Lv.Here P f ( (manSv) 1) is the probability coefficient for fatal cancer induced per unit collective dose received (either ground shine, ingestion or both), w nf is the weight of non-fatal cancers relative to fatal cancers, w h is the weight of hereditary consequences relative to fatal cancers, L (years) is the average LLE from a fatal cancer and v (USD/life year) is the monetary value of a statistical life year (VSLY)."
"The concept of VSLY was developed in public policy making to put monetary value on the reduction of risk of death for an average statistical individual ( Higgins_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"COCO-2 implements WTP approach, which values life in terms of the amounts that people are prepared to pay to reduce risk of death/illness (NHS and private medical insurance are good examples Higgins_et al.,_2008_CITE)"
"According to ( Miller,_2000_CITE), VSLY can be estimated as the value of statistical life (VSL) divided by average life expectancy (LE), with VSL set to be 120 times the GDP per capita in a given year"
"This estimate is in line with the WTP-based calculations in Jones-Lee,_Loomes,_and_Spackman_(2007)_CITE who use alternative metrics called value of life year (VOLY) and value of preventable fatality (VPF) specified for multiple age groups"
Munro_(2013)_CITE quotes considerably higher values for VSLY: 3 8 times the GDP per capita in the US and 3 times the GDP per capita in Australia
"The HC and WTP approaches, along with the VPF, VOLY, QALY and VSLY indices, are discussed in detail in Harada_et al._(2014)_CITE, Higgins_et al._(2008)_CITE, Jones-Lee_et al._(2007)_CITE, Jones-Lee_(2007)_CITE, Mason,_Jones-Lee,_and_Donaldson_(2009)_CITE, Wells_(2011)_CITE, both for a broad variety of health effects and specifically for radiation-related effects"
"In addition, a number of studies since Chernobyl have shown that the health effects due to stress may be commensurate with the health effects associated directly with the radiological exposure ( IAEA,_2006;_Karaoglou,_1996_CITE)"
"We believe that at the current state of knowledge there is no absolutely compelling evidence in favour of any particular approach for putting monetary values on heath, including the effects of radiation, and coming up with the best possible valuation for economic consequences of receiving a dose remains of large significance ( Thomas_&_Vaughan,_2015_CITE)."
"According to Munro_(2013)_CITE, remediation costs are simply proportional to the number of clean-up exercises, N"
"Typical remediation measures include replacement of contaminated soil in populated areas, radical improvement of grassland, application of mineral fertilisers to potato fields and application of special food additives to livestock ( Jacob_et al.,_2009_CITE)."
"This matches with the evidence from Fukushima ( Munro,_2013_CITE)"
"Therefore, the marginal cost d C/|d r| of clearing an additional unit of radiation rises according to F r when r decreases; this corresponds to the diminishing returns from further remediation, which is in line with the evidence from Fukushima ( Munro,_2013_CITE)"
"There is also an indication in the literature that in relatively large urban areas Fp and Fpp are slowly increasing functions of the population p, which grow by approximately 6% when the population doubles ( Ciccone_&_Hall,_1996_CITE)"
"However, owing to the fact that the vast majority of nuclear installations are surrounded by rural or, at most, semi-urban areas ( Grimston_et al.,_2014_CITE), we can safely assume that all the productivity figures per person defined in this section are constants and are determined by the economic make up of the given locations regardless of their population sizes."
"A radioactive release is likely to lead to partial disruption of the normal economic activity at the affected area through a variety of factors including stress from perceived nuclear risk ( Munro_&_Managi,_2014_CITE), which could be modelled by adding the negative Fdp term to the productivity (the disruption cost per capita, Fd, is positive by definition)"
"Therefore, accounting for the compensation payments is only going to distort the economic valuation of the true costs of a nuclear disaster, as was arguably the case for Chernobyl ( Lochard_&_Schneider,_1992_CITE)."
"First we introduce the notion of the expected remaining costs at a given location (per unit area) between the current moment t and a given optimisation horizon T by integrating the instantaneous flow of costs F along hypothetical future optimal paths and discounting by constant interest rate (the latter is significant for the long-term problem) Dixit_and_Pindyck_(1994)_CITE: (13)V(p,r,t,T)= tTF(p(t ),r(t ),t )e (t t)dt +VT.This function depends on the state variables p, r evaluated at the current moment t, in accordance with the Optimal Control Theory."
"The horizon T is an exogenous parameter usually specified by the regulators for each particular problem setting, based on the set of characteristic timescales involved and on the management options available ( Dixit_&_Pindyck,_1994_CITE)"
"According to Bellman principle of optimality, the cost function (13) satisfies a PDE often referred to as the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation ( Bellman,_1956_CITE)"
"He_and_Zhuang_(2016)_CITE, for example, use a damage from disaster function V similar to (13) to find a balance between investment in preparedness and potential costs of relief for a generic disaster"
"The data in Lochard_and_Schneider_(1992)_CITE is given in the RUB (1987 price levels), whereas ( Jacob_et al.,_2009_CITE) is using EUR (2010 price levels)"
"The health costs from radiation-induced effects were estimated in Lochard_and_Schneider_(1992)_CITE, who quote the value Fr= 10,750 per man Sv claimed to account for the costs associated with LLE from fatal cancers as well as the costs of medical treatment"
"A detailed account of remediation costs from a number of rural areas in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia is provided in Jacob_et al._(2009)_CITE"
"According to ( Jacob_et al.,_2009_CITE), multiple remediation measures undertaken in year 2010 collectively averted Davt=p0 Ravt=161.7manSv, corresponding to average individual averted dose Ravt=2.073millisievert"
Lochard_and_Schneider_(1992)_CITE also has information for the overall resettlement costs
"According to ( WNN,_2012_CITE), the Fukushima City (65 kilometres from the plant) with p0=290,000 inhabitants (110,000 households) received the contamination levels between 5 and 10 millisievert/year due to Cs-137"
"Omoto_(2012)_CITE quotes the total number of 140,000 evacuees as a result of the nuclear disaster; 58% of the evacuees had received a dose less than 1 millisievert and 99.3% less than 10 millisievert"
"There are detailed accounts of moving the people at the Fukushima prefecture (see, for example, Akahane,_2013_CITE) that could be used to estimate and F , but we are going to leave this for a future study."
"Gillett_et al._(2001)_CITE gives rough estimates for radiocaesium flux through food produce (becquerel/year/hectare) across England and Wales in the aftermath of Chernobyl, quoting figures of 18, 40 and 110 Gbecquerel/year for sheep meat, cereal crops and cow milk, respectively, from all the agricultural areas during the first year after the disaster"
"With the total flux Q=168 Gbecquerel/year, average pre-accident yield m0=5 tonnes per hectare per annum ( DEFRA,_2008_CITE), average UK contamination level of B=2.21kilobecquerel/m2 over the total affected area A=2.4 105squarekilometre (see Table III.1 from De Cort_et al.,_1998_CITE, quoting the total UK contamination at 0.53 Pbecquerel), we can get a rough estimate for the transfer coefficient from soil to food: a=Q/(Am0B)=6.33 10 4 becquerel/kilogram per becquerel/sqaure metre"
"while the annual food biomass productivity in the UK is estimated at 90 billion kilograms ( Weighell,_2011_CITE)"
"To specify their relative contributions to the dose rates, we use the total deposited quantities similar to those from the source term in Fukushima ( WHO,_2013_CITE), and assume that the deposition period lasts for t0=30 days, with constant deposition rates throughout"
"The radiation levels of up to 100 millisievert/year are beyond the current public safety laves provided by ICRP and IAEA, although they may still be allowed for specialist workers ( WHO,_2013_CITE)"
"For instance, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the initial emergency response and restoration lasting days and weeks was followed by the full reconstruction of the area which took place over a longer time scale of months and years, with changes in the New Orleans population over this longer period playing an important role ( Fussell,_2015_CITE)"
